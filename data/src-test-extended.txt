The Staff was friendly, the hotel was clean and the morning breakfast offered each morning was delicious. We had some issues with the shuttle service as each time the van was 20 minutes out - and 40 minutes later, it was still 20 minutes out... location convenient close to space needle and garden, and free shuttle to market place. I would just be more vocal about housekeeping next time. I thought that was very awesome for them to do! Room layout was a little weird with a a living room-ette where the 40 TV could be swiveled to about 5' in front of your face. Location was great because you're so close to everything downtown! They are so helpful with everything even take you to places in their shuttle service. Great location being next to the space needle, city center, museums, duck rides and the monorail! BREAKFAST - included in room stay - excellent hot breakfast, omelettes made fresh, pastries, cereal, fruit, great meal  OTHER - on 8th floor is outside patio, great view of space needle, comfortable chairs and tables, propane fire pits turned on in the evenings, It was a bit intimidating and could have been handled nicer. Cook to order breakfast and full bar for the evening. I definitely recommend it, the breakfast buffet was sooo good!! Gym was small, a couple treadmills ellipticals and bikes, set of dumbbells, and one cable rack but also had a ball and foam rollers for recovery. The hotel was great, but I was surprised there was no room service. The kitchenette does not seem to go with the image the Hotel. Situated near the Space Needle, the Seattle Center, and Memorial Stadium, Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown is a three-star hotel where amenities available to guests include a business centre and a gym. Upgraded quarters include rooms with city views and studios and one-bedroom suites. The bar in the lobby has a limited menu with a number of tasty food items. Great stay, had a view straight in front of the space needle. I had a great two night stay at the Hyatt House Hotel, designed to offer more residential environment. Soundproof windows with blackout shades; heard no hallway noise at all. It didn’t bother me once and I’m an incredibly light sleeper. Parking inside the building is protected by a gate, and price is the same as other nearby gated garages. My stay at the Hyatt House in Seattle was wonderful. There was a problem with the disposal in kitchen and they couldn't fix it because of no supply of that broken unit. We had a view room, 4th floor, room was beautiful, clean, modern, kitchen was bonus. Oddly, I would still recommend this hotel as the location, room size, and price were great. My partner was the one that checked in to the hotel. One bartender said they  had to wash glasses and I think forgot about us so another bartender ending up helping us and pulled a glass straight from a shelf. Parking is underground, down a side street- call ahead they'll give you directions. The late night happy hour and small bites menu was also great. We stayed here the night before a 15k run in Seattle. But we got a promotion to a suits with space needle view. The shower was clogged which was not too pleasant but I guess happens... 4. We did receive towels for 2 days, but the floor and surfaces were not swept/wiped EVER. On the last night we had to call for towels. Has a nice little kitchen with stovetop, microwave and fridge. The room is spacious, bed is comfortable, clean and bright, breakfast is good, staff are friendly It was in a central location to everything including the rail system to downtown & the armory (which has tons of great food). Kitchen counter and rolly chair good for getting work done. We did not use it, but it did appear to be well equipped. The hotel was a great spot and close to walking distance of everything. Everyone who works at the Hyatt house was very nice and helpful. Its a great place for friends and family to stay. Hyatt House is in good location especially right across the Space Needle. Some noise but that's pretty much a given on the 2nd. Luggage storage, complimentary newspapers, and limited paid parking are also available to guests. But, the elevator was broken during last 3-day visits, had to use stairs to 8th floor with my little kids. Had 2 queen suite, kitchen nice, but was disappointed due to no views at all no even with a request. Everyone had wonderful customer service and it was a relaxing stay I certainly would stay again and breakfast was delicious...... But other than that, this is the perfect hotel, saved to my favorites for me to stay in every trip I take to Seattle from now on!! The room far exceeded my expectations, and I was lucky enough to have my window facing the Space Needle so that was really exciting also. I don't see anyone using this space as intended (I used it for my luggage instead of the luggage rack/stand). Wish I had known about this this place a long time ago. Nice staffs, good location, just few walks to space needle, pile market there's many bar and restaurant. Check in a little slow, but room was very large and comfortable. They provide a free shuttle serve to near by locations that you can’t beat considering the fantastic location. We got there in the morning about 9:30 and they let us checked in immediately! Very nice hotel with nice amenities, staff was very helpful and attentive to you Right across the street from the Space Needle, it's a quiet hotel despite it's location. The customer service displayed by both Luke at the front desk and Carl the shuttle driver was exceptional. The Hyatt House room had a full kitchen with all utensils, comfy sitting area and the bed and bathroom facilities were excellent. During our 3 night stay, not once did the bathroom get cleaned. Slow room service, if need extra towels and shampoo, go get it yourself. If the room had a safe, I would rate it higher. Bonus cheap happy hour, free breakfast, easy to access parking. Perfect location for the Seattle Marathon start/finish, 5 minute walk to start line. Overall I felt it was a very safe location - though on the last night we were awakened by what sounded like gunshots. I’ve stayed at many and this by far best fits my needs! Good stay- free shuttle to nearby places within one mile When they heard it was our honeymoon, they went above and beyond! Although minimal and small, equipment was brand new and got the job done for a.m. cardio. Free breakfast every morning and the room accommodated a family of 6. It was also great to have a coin laundry on site since my husband & I bought our 2 kids with us. Free shuttle bus was good for getting to were you need to go, but was not able to bring you back to hotel. When I first walked into my room I yelled holy $%@! The front desk staff was very accommodating and helped me find a good spot to set up my gift bags and pop some champagne! I heard no noise from neighbors, and the morning breakfast was probably the best included breakfast I have had at any hotel. The free shuttle got us most places around the city we wanted to see within one mile the of the hotel. There were 6 of us so great having the kitchen area. Hotel situated directly across from the Space Needle allowing for a nice view from our 6th floor room. Overall the hotel was nice but the staff was rude and the room being cleaned daily was frustrating. The staff at breakfast time are all lovely, they can't do enough for you. Everything was generous, upgrade, free rides to downtown, great breakfast. Free breakfast was really good, go early if you want an omelet or you'll have to wait a bit. We were celebrating my birthday on a Friday night which got kind of loud and resulted in a noise complaint. The Hyatt House is in a great location right next to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Chihuly Garden, etc.) The room was very large and comfortable for my 3 sisters and myself. We stay in Seattle ever year at Holidays but didn't know this place existed. The manager came up and told us we could bring our drinks/music to the rooftop lounge or he would reserve an area near the bar where we could continue our fun without creating too much noise for the guests. Hotel had free 24 hr shuttle that was very convenient(one day it was down but they offered to refund us whatever we payed for taxi as long as it was within a 1 mile radius) I would definitely stay here again! The free breakfast was very average, so we passed on the second and third days. The room was very spacious and perfect for the occasion. Great room set-up, perfect for our family with 2 young kids. Lots of space to run around, bring groceries (from the nearby QFC in), and sprawl out with all the stuff we travel with. The hotel was great but towards the end of the stay. Brennan, the concierge who assisted us with reservations, transportation and honest restaurant reviews was great and familiar with the area. If I had to say a bad thing it would be that the daily maid service was a little off & seemed scatterbrained (left the room half done a few times) . I've been in other hotel rooms with better plug options, but this was good enough. We did put up the sign for full housekeeping service, but that did not even merit getting a new toilet paper roll. On the weekends, it includes made-to-order omelets which were quite tasty. Also shuttle service is great but not too friendly drivers. Only thing I regret is not making it up to the rooftop terrace. Had a drink at the H Bar and it took 15-20 minutes before a bartender gave us a drink. STAFF - all were extremely friendly and helpful, always did the extra things to make stay great,  SHUTTLE - 24 hour free shuttle pick up or drop off within a mile of hotel was great, we used it several times to go to various locations such as Pike Market or giant ferris wheel. I was hosting my best friends bachelorette party here and arrived before the room was ready. Fridge with microwave, large flatscreen TV, large walk in shower. I wish there was a bellhop and cheaper overnight parking. Excellent breakfast in the morning (I'd value it at least $25) with hot buffet, made to order eggs, all juices, fresh fruit, coffee, bagels. There was no clear indication on how to park your car in the hotel, we had to go a couple of rounds till we found the entrance and then had issues getting them to open the parking lot. The hotel offers a shuttle service to destinations within a one-mile radius of the hotel which includes Pike Place Market, Westlake Center, and the Victoria Clipper Pier. We just had to continually ask to have our room cleaned each day; one day not being there all day and returning at 7pm the room still had not been touched. The rooms are well furnished and large, the bed is firm with good linens, automated shades. We will definitely have to make this a regular stay. It was located conveniently across from the space needle and walking distance to downtown and the public market. The room was small, but nicely appointed and we were hardly in it, so we really didn't need it to be big. There was no room safe, so there was concern leaving a laptop and other valuable. Was hung up on by hotel staff multiple times while trapped in their “affiliates” parking structure. Staff was hit and miss, but overall competent and friendly. There is also the Seattle Monorail just a short walk from the motel which will take you into the downtown sector. Plus, guests can dine at the H Bar or pick up snacks from the 24/7 convenience store. Courtesy local shuttle with a friendly driver was definitely a perk! Limited room service menu, but close to restaurants and the hotel offers shuttle service free in a five mile radius. Once we were in the room we were visited by the hotel security to identify that the visitor was me. Many employees at the desk didn’t appear to be very knowledgeable about touristy things or about restaurants which was a bit disappointing being a visitor. Oh and you can't get any closer to the Space Needle and the surrounding tourist hotspots. The children's museum & park are basically half a block away too! Wonderful fresh fruit salad, an omelet bar, and other hot and cold food selections. Work-wise, there's a business center in the lobby with free printing, and there's a Fedex Kinkos about 3-blocks away. We checked in for a Mini Vac of 4 days. The room seemed updated, modern and clean, though housekeeping skipped us on our first day and we found a knit cap that likely belonged to the prior guests. Takes long time to get hold of staff on the phone, just go to front desk to speak. This hotel lies half a mile from the Olympic Sculpture Park, within 1.5 miles of the Seattle Aquarium and Great Wheel, and a 25-minute drive from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The staff had no idea what to do or say but apologize about it. Standard and accessible rooms offer seating areas, en-suite facilities, and flat-screen TVs. Many normal gyms are very close for your regular lift. The front desk staff was rude when we wanted to ride the free shuttle; we just wanted to be dropped off the furthest they would and they gave us a hard time. This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at the staff was excellent   They have a really nice breakfast buffet. Check-in was delayed by about 20 minutes (at 4pm...) and they gave me a mobility access room - they should tell you how to turn on the shower in this room because it wasn't obvious (pull the smaller knob from the wall). Location is excellent - literally right under the space needle, within walking distance of a night out, and you can take a cheap taxi/uber to finer dining. If I had one negative thing to say it would be that the elevator is way too slow... Very close to Space Needle and several museums, and there is a free shuttle that takes you to Pike Place Market and other attractions near the waterfront. Great hotel for business travelers - my King had the full kitchen (stove, fridge, sink) and was stocked with kitchen essentials. On top of that, it very clean, well decorated and great staff. The breakfast buffet was really good also, great quality and many options for many types of eaters both super healthy like myself, to someone looking for a delicious tasty breakfast. The hot breakfast every morning was really well done, a good choice variety each morning. Facilities at Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown include meeting space, laundry, and express check-in and check-out options. Very nice room, up to date appliances in the full kitchen, comfortable bed and minimal noise for being directly next to the light rail! We liked have the seating area separate from the beds. Room was clean and we had a perfect view to space needle. - just a mile (ish) walk from Pike Place Market. It is centrally located and very convenient to several major attractions. The elevators for some reason stopped working everyone was taking the stairs and it was horrible. Their housekeeping though is kinda slow, they maybe have a short staff during our stay.
Tiny Rooms, smells terrible, very noisy from the road, too high priced, under Chinese management All rooms are equipped with completely new bathrooms as well as TV, minibar and hairdryer. We had a jumbled schedule and they were incredibly helpful, hospitable, attentive and friendly. I can handle clean and dated over modern and nasty any day! There were periods when it would work well and others when it was almost nonfunctional. Even though that is a significant minus for me, the staff's willingness to try and meet our needs, their friendliness and the price made this a value and I would consider staying there again. Wifi availabe in all rooms and areas within the resort, Located near all importand sights as Shoppingarea, musea, Theatres and international Restaurants. The hotel itself is a little dated, but it is clean. The RESIDENZ CITY is situated in the city centre and easy reachable by car, train and public traffic facillities. In this pretty, cosy Resort you will find all modern facillities and standards which you may expect in a three star Hotel in Germany. I think the price i paid for it and what we got in the end was not really worth it as i paid for 1/2 price elsewhere and got 5 star service. Out side traffic very noisy pillows very uncomfortable to far from town centre
Close to transport links, restaurants and shops, the hotel is just ten minutes away on foot from the popular area of Shoreditch. Next time if I ask for two nights perhaps I can be booked in for two nights, hotel was close to tube and very central for major London attractions. A breakfast buffet is served every morning, while a selection of tasty evening meals is also available  The Old Street Underground Station is a five-minute walk from the property. Single bed in the room was dreadful - you could feel every spring. A 24-hour front desk is also on-hand to provide assistance whenever needed. My stay would have been better if ORBITZ had not booked me in for two separate nights meaning I had to check out on the Friday morning, leave my luggage in reception and re-check in on Friday night. The Museum of London is less than 15 minutes away on foot. A flat-screen television, work desk and tea/coffee making facilities come as standard with every room at the Travelodge London Central City Road. Each room also contains an en-suite bathroom with complimentary toiletries and fresh towels. The hotel were brilliant and kept me on the same floor. Very handy to several tube lines, nice pubs and restaurants in the area. We were here pre Christmas and other guests were incredibly noisy banging doors and talking in corridors from very early morning. The picturesque Travelodge London Central City Road is a budget-friendly accommodation option for those wanting to stay in the centre of the city.
Very close to bars and eateries, facilities not the best, bathroom is small, breakfast is great, staff is really kind would recommend if you are only staying for the night...................................  ...... . Room was decent size and clean, staff were friendly and let me check in early, overall a good stay for the price considering how much other hotels in Boston can cost! But I was not in Boston for the hotel, and the location was great in terms of nearness to Common & Convention Center. Mine appeared to be furnished with castoffs that had been found on the curb after college students threw them out as junk. Give the irregular nature of the rooms it is possible some are much better than the one I endured. Also didn't have a coffee pot or anything in room. They didn't really have an answer on it or seem too concerned either. This budget-friendly accommodation choice is just five minutes away on foot from the Boston Public Garden. Could have done with one more blanket with the cold winter weather. I couldn't get a good night sleep with the noise and couldn't turn the unit off since I stayed mid-summer. The windows leaked cold air like a sieve and the heater continually came on and off, a forced hot air unit which was very loud for the room size. Even though my room was small it was comfortable as clean with a nice window view. Definitely an older hotel and bits are a little tired but they are currently renovating so that should solve that! Found Hotel Boston Comon, has excellent service, Edward the Manager, and everybody else is  always making sure the guests are happy. The room was extremely small, which was ok for the price we paid. horrible hotel  - the bed was broken and on a slant. Built in 1877 as 10 unit apartment building, the process of dividing it up into rooms for a hotel has left some very tiny rooms. Tried to take a shower our first night and had no hot water. A cable television and coffee maker come as standard with all the air conditioned rooms at the Milner Hotel. With its origins dating back to 1877, the historic Milner Hotel is located right in the middle of Boston’s Theatre District. It is unfortunate,  because it has a great location and the front of this hotel is so deceiving in that it is modern and classy,but once you get inside it's like stepping into a time warp and experiencing a facility that was probably in its heyday in the 1920's. Everithing was ok except for shower wich has few hot water. Large sign announces renovations will happen, I hope it includes new furniture in room I occupied. Lots of variety and someone was on-hand to make sure nothing ran out. Nice and clean sheets with lots of nice soft pillows! In addition, each room features a private bathroom with complimentary toiletries and a hairdryer. Very friendly staff, a little bit loud - there is a busy street right next to it, considering the prize a good hotel to stay for a couple of days, given how discounted the night was, and that it was only one night I liked it. Newbury Street and Copley Square are both within 20 minutes away from the hotel on foot. If you need a affordable hotel that is clean, comfortable, good location and has a friendly staff this is a good hotel. A Celtics game let out and was very noisy but I think that is to be expected... On the first day, ( before we even started to use the toilet) when I tried to flush down a piece of tissue I used to wipe the surface of the sink, the water in the toilet just kept going up. Overall friendly staff, breakfast included, convenient location with close parking garage. Self-service laundry facilities, 24-hour front desk and a business center are other public amenities offered by the accommodation. The best aspect of the hotel is its location downtown Boston within walking distance of Common Grounds, Chinatown and many theaters. The windows were cheap single pane style that did nothing to deaden the street sounds. My room was very small and had a very loud / noisy individual air conditioning unit. Difficult to get to the windows to open shades/window, Beds were in the way. The hotel is small, there is no lobby and the breakfast area is tight. Take a white noise machine with you and it's bearable but no wonder it was so cheap on Expedia. Staff very nice, but the 4th floor is the only one done that I can tell. A free continental breakfast is served each morning at the hotel. The nightly rate was similar to other hotels in the area, but if planned in advance you can get a similar rate at a more well-established hotel with better amenities. The building is old, and the bathroom could do with some upgrading - which we were told is being planned. Hotel had a cozy feel, just a small room, perfect for what we needed. small rooms but nicely refurbished and the bathroom was lovely, except no hot water at night at the sink and very low water pressure in the shower in the AM. But other than that, our overnight was a pleasant experience. Found hotel is the best in the city , the staff are so comforting, and breakfast is so good. The hotel provides Wi-Fi throughout the building and is inclusive with all stays. they need to make sure their water heater can keep up with demand once it's running on full steam. I might stay again because of location and staff, but room itself was poor. The hotel room was in a good location and the check in and staff were great. Heating didn't work at all and it took a long time to get hot water for the shower. An extra chair would have been nice, as well as an ice bucket. Also hotel is right around the corner from Wang and Wilbur theatres! They are working on the building to male it even better. I have stayed in hundreds of different hotels around the world for both pleasure and business and this dump is without a doubt one of the worst I have ever experienced. I would hope you would remove this disgusting facility from your list of acceptable hotels to stay in while in Boston. Overall it was a nice hotel but the noise coming from the street was terrible. Tiny hotel room, and the pictures on the site is misleading. The room was small and the mattress was not the most comfortable. Room was clean and people were polite had wifi to parking garage across the street looks nice to Very friendly and helpful,bedroom was very small, seemed more suited for a single bed than double and bed firmer than we like, did have a great bathroom though.
The four-star Holiday Inn Paris - Notre Dame is located on the Left Bank of the River Seine, right in the centre of Paris. Paris isn't cheap but there are plenty of good places to eat nearby and if you go into the side streets you can get a good meal while avoiding rip-off prices. Hotel offered 2 levels of breakfast (buffet &/or continental) which was nice, especially if you wanted to get something to eat quickly to then get on with your day. Including the breakfast option was also a good savings idea and the rooftop terrace of the hotel gave us another view of the city and a nice place to unwind and enjoy a refreshment. A block from the several train lines...easy walking distance to Notre Dame and the Louvre...lots of nice places to eat and shop. I said it all in the title to this review. No ashtrays provided on terrace therefore butts thrown over balcony to our level. Hotel clean and rooms modern although are abit on the small size but not so much that it caused a problem. A breakfast buffet is available every morning in Le Quarante Trois restaurant. We booked a standard room but as we were staying 4 nights they gave us a “larger” room which was meant for wheelchair users. Many, many cute little eateries located in the blocks surrounding the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel they did not have any record of my booking. Definitely not 4 star hotel, more like modest 3 star. The problem we had was the bathroom which was a wet room and although there was curtains round the shower the floor got soaked. Some rooms on the upper floors boast Eiffel Tower views. Also offered a shuttle ride to the airport (for a fee) which was easier than taking the Metro & less expensive than taking a taxi. The hotel is situated near to the metro, the line that covers a number of attractions. Both my wife and I have MacBook Airs( new) and neither of us could use the internet effectively. Rooftop floor needs fixing but other than that installations and location is good. This hotel is right in the middle of everything you want in Paris. The Notre Dame area has plenty of dining and shopping options. Rooftop deck with Eiffel tower view puts it over the top! Easy to get to from Gard de Nord on the metro. Rooms were a bit small but It may be the rule in Europe as we have experience the same in other places on the other hand they provide everything you need. The hotel is well situated for Paris and that is a real bonus. The Metro is close by or, if you like walking, you can get pretty much anywhere on foot. Despite the fact that we were out for most of the day the room was not cleaned up even after we requested it leaving for dinner. Breakfast bar mare didn't keep breakfast warm enough & had cold eggs, bacon & stale bread . As we have found, rooms in Paris tend to be small by US standards, but we were find in the space we had. Rue Danton is a very picturesque street filled with rest. Not enough wardrobe space, didn't replenish coffee & teas, soaps etc daily. The room was very small, glass courtin to the toilet instead of doors. Breakfast was just not great for Paris Woman working in the  the restorant at breaksat time unpleasant On a main street which had noise until late in the evening on the weekend nights. Location was the most important factor for our group and we really got the best, we could walk to many of the tourist attractions, food places, Metro subway, River boat tours. Hotel is centrally located making the city very walkable with Metro access very close. We upgraded to a room with view of the Eiffel Tower which was well worth it and there’s a great view from the roof terrace. Several Metro stations close by made it easy to get around Paris without a car & to get to all of the top rated tourist sites. Bathroom was also tiny had to put toiletries on floor under sink. location was perfect, some things were lacking,like a luggage rack.very tight room Wonderful location short walking distance to Notre Dame, Pont Neuf, Saint Chapelle, Blvd. The Holiday Inn - Notre Dame is a nice, quaint hotel. Travelling with a spouse/partner it is tolerable but not great if you were travelling with a friend. Great location , helpful staff , small room  Close to train , Easy to get a taxi , Great shopping and food area . This is the second time I stay at this hotel. The reception at the Holiday Inn Paris - Notre Dame is open 24-hours and provides a range of services, including currency exchange, ticket booking and safe-keeping. Overall good experience - hotel is close to the RER on the line from CDG airport, well kept, clean, has reasonable sized rooms for a city centre hotel with comfy beds and there is a rooftop terrace which would be great in the summer. The myriad bars, restaurants, shops, sights and landmarks of the Latin Quarter are all right on the hotel's doorstep. I have stayed in this hotel on many occasions and will do so again The rooms are a bit small, but that was to be expected, as most hotel rooms in Paris are rather small. Notre Dame Cathedral, the Pantheon and Saint-Michel Métro station are within easy strolling distance of this chic eco-hotel. Very obliging printing tickets received by email, arranging transport to and from the airport as well as being a mine of information for things like doctors, chemists and laundry. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and professional. I booked via the website, as I have done previously, and received confirmation. There were only two minus points - (i) the road the hotel is on is busier (certainly at weekends) than it looked on Streetview with bin lorries that collect at 6.30am and (ii) the interior designers have decided that it is a good idea to have a window between the bathroom and bedroom with a blind on the outside and a sliding glass door which doesn't really close properly. The restroom was extra small, with the toilet being in an awkward location. Great hotel and perfect location ..2 mins walk from the metro and 5 mins from notre dame  cathedral with plenty of cafes, pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Very helpful staff, good accommodations, nice rooftop, and close to many attractions. Guests can also relax on the rooftop terrace and savour the stellar views with a drink or light bite from the hotel bar. I like it because it is walking distance to anywhere and has good transport connections. Righ next to the hotel you can find a mini convenience store for any of your needs (fruit, water, etc) It is walking distance to Notre Dame and Saint Chapel. They printed french phrases for us so we could find some medication at the pharmacy, helped with directions to different areas, and were very attentive to our needs. It is in a lively neighborhood, plenty of brasseries nearby. A very friendly staff and being a Holiday Inn you get most of the room amenities you would get in the US of course the size is smaller. Saint Germain, and walkable to Louvre, Place Vendome, Galeries Lafayette. My only real complaint is that we never had good internet. All of the hotel's stylish, wood panelled guest rooms come with flat-screen TVs, high-speed Internet and coffee/tea making facilities. My girlfriend was sick for a couple days, and the hotel staff went out of their way to help her. The big issue we had was the door into bathroom, it was a frosted glass sliding door and when closed it did not close properly therefore you had no privacy at all. No wash cloths in the bathroom but seems common in Europe. The only drawback is that the place is pretty noisy, being right at the street.
Handy for railway station and trams over all nice pllace meet every thing I needed The 146 rooms of the IntercityHotel offer every conceivable comfort and create an extremely pleasant atmosphere. For all IntercityHotels concerned the usage of the WLAN is free of charge up to 256 KB/s. The city’s airport and the Düsseldorf Exhibition Grounds are only 10 km away, and the closest motorway junction in a distance of 1.5 km is within reach. The hotel offers excellent value for money, with spacious and clean rooms in a practical location. In addition to a sumptuous breakfast buffet, the guest can enjoy the amenities of the conservatory, the hotel restaurant and the hotel bar. The bedding also felt like it was for a single bed not a double as it didn't go down the side like a duvet usually would. we loved staying at Intercity Hotel in  Dusseldorf , very central in town and very close to the train station. excellent position close to rail and underground overall good hotel at reasonable price only fault bar was closed most of the time thro our visit so if you if you like a drink before bed you may be disappointed The historic city centre, the German Opera on the Rhine and the Hofgarten (the Court Gardens) can also be visited easily and quickly. Hotel clean and functional and ok for couple nights bed and shower. The centrally located IntercityHotel Düsseldorf is situated near the main station and the famous Königsallee. Take advantage of your FreeCityTicket, included in the price of your room, to travel free of charge by local public transport and discover Düsseldorf or other cities of the Rhine-Ruhr area. The 4 conference rooms with their daylight illumination and state-of-the-art conference technology provide the ideal environment for your event in our conference hotel in Düsseldorf. Marked down from 5 to a 4 because room was clearly made up for 1 person not 2, and only found out late we only had 1 towel for 2 people so couldn't shower. Hotel provided free travel cards for entire stay, valid on bus, tram, train and tube. Do not expect too much luxury, and understand that general neighbourhood is not the very best - but realise this is a pleasant stay in a very practical location - then you should be just fine.
Overall it was reasonably priced, but I wouldn't stay here again Room was very clean and I would have no hesitation in recommending it. The bed and breakfast offers coffee, juice and croissants in the morning. The bed and breakfast is a five minute walk from Colón metro station and one kilometre from Plaza de Toros de Valencia. Beautiful place to stay if you want to be close to everything yet in a quiet neighbourhood. Only plus is that it is close to city attractions. With the exception of the noise factor from restaurant patrons late nights, everything was exceptional. Lovely B&B (though breakfast is extra), lovely old building with lots of original features, great location and super staff, all very friendly and helpful. The downsides are the difficult parking situation and our bathroom smelled mildly of sewage. Breakfast is offered in a cafe at the local market and is excellent value and well worth having. elevator very claustrphobic fitting one bag and a person with difficulty. The bright rooms with wood floors and rural-inspired decor feature flat-screens, fans and shared or private bathrooms. There are various restaurants and bars within a close walking distance. Enrique was a great host, list of information on where to go and what to do. Left the hotel in an hour and checked into a much nicer Melia. The staff had offered to switch my room but for two nights stay, I just sucked it up for night two. Set in a vibrant area full of shops and restaurants, Hi Valencia Cánovas is a charming bed and breakfast that offers free Wi-Fi in the rooms and a bike rental service. I like having a separate private bathroom, the room was clean and the location was good. Room was nice and quite big, but bed really uncomfortable. A bit tricky to find however its in a really good location, staff were good, checkin was easy, rooms were lovely. From checking in and everything in-between my overall stay was superb. There's a nice rooftop terrace with furnishings, a baggage storage and a tour desk. They do have a separate bathroom, just a step away over the corridor, with its own key. The room was very average, nothing extra to make you feel special. A kid three years and under can stay free of charge. Great location and overall a nice and clean apartment that is pleasantly decorated. Hi Valencia Cánovas is two kilometres from Estació del Nord (Valencia) train station, Valencia Cathedral and Torres de Serranos, for panoramic views of the city. In fact, my stay in Valencia was too short; I do plan on returning, and I would highly recommend this place even to my (enemies) - that's a stretch... but for sure I rated it exremely high. Bathroom (private) across the hallway was a bit small, but manageable. At this juncture, I am still checked-in, but I could not wait to give this establishment a rating. There were lists of what not to do and how much you would be charged if you left the air conditioning on when you weren't in the room etc. You are required to go to 2nd floor for checkin.
It’s run wonderfully well with a very social atmosphere of a beer garden. The beach house can sleep up to 16 and features a pool, pool table, and ping pong table. All the guests and staff were friendly with a positive and fun energy. Overall, the next vacation I'll be choosing a different hotel to stay at. Reception area includes a great bar with cheap drink pricing. Also the bathroom shower had clear curtains and the window had not curtains at all so it was very uncomfortable getting washed, also getting dressed the kitchen window was huge with no curtains as well. All rooms are individually decorated, many with en suite bathrooms whilst others have shared bathroom facilities. Bikini Lodge offers luggage storage, airport shuttle service, laundry facilities, and multilingual staff. And there is little to no parking so good luck driving in Excellent service offered with many tours and night club options. Lincoln Road is less than a 10-minute walk from this hotel, and it's less than a five-minute walk to Whole Foods. Rooms styles include apartments, bunk bed apartments, studio apartment, and a beach house. it gets good ratings for a hostel and that is why I never have stayed in one. Advertised free WiFi thay didn't work the 3 nights we stayed. Ocean Drive is a 15-minute walk from this hotel, while Flamingo Park is just a two-minute walk away. Great centralized place to be able to walk to everything. I feel like pictures were taken when hotel was probably first opened!! Cons first - No wifi in room - Kitchenette was barely okay with limited items - Parking is $20 with limited spots. Price is cheap, and they do have rooms to accommodate large groups, but you are better off somewhere else. The Free breakfast buffet was boiled eggs, stale cereal, and warm milk that sat open in a pitcher. By the way, the accommodations are large with renovated bathrooms that were nice. Many tour and night club options available and offered at discounted prices. The stuff were pretty nice, they didn't miss treat us at all. The representative that greeted us had the most sour attitude. I thank the staff for a lovely time and stay. I would NEVER of booked this if I was told this before hand. Staff was pleasant but tried charging me twice because 1 didn't even know what Expedia was! We paid $100 a night and I believe the room should of been only 50/60 a night. They actually had us cut up one of their towels into a wash rag. It seems like a family run hotel with owners that care. The room itself looked as if it had not been cleaned in months. Breakfast consisted of 3-4 types of cereal, boiled eggs, juice and coffee. Accommodations were as wonderful as the vibrant city of S. Beach. If your under the age of 24, single and want to pay a cheap price go for it. If you at all want some comfort at an affordable cost go somewhere else. I’ve stayed here before and come back for the cleanliness, staff, location and amenities. Pros - Big room - Clean bedding - Breakfast included though limited - Beer garten atmosphere was nice I’ve been traveling to miami and this is the only place that love to stay. Bikini Lodge offers a variety of accommodation options and a party-like atmosphere in the heart of Miami's South Beach within walking distance to the beach. Don’t forget the bike rack and bikes available for rental. Dont fall into the misleading reviews... its not what they say. Studio was spacious, clean and staff members were all friendly. The a/c wasn't working,the refrigerator weren't cool enough to cool my drinks up so basically it wasn't working at all!!!
I was lucky to find this place in such short order. The sinks don't drain, the a/c didn't work, the showers were nuts and the tvs don't work in all the rooms. This was something I overlooked, so it was a surprise when I arrived at 1-ish. They were so rude about everything that I had 1 1/2 hour to find another place to stay or they weren't going to refund my money. Hotel was handy to get to the AFB for activities, but the access driveway was a safety hazard- you had to cross over exit ramp traffic just to get to it. However, there were no safety concerns outside of my own paranoia and preferences. Getting rest is not an option due to the horrible matresses and noise level. The place suited us for the time that we were there, as it took us to the base within a minute or two. Inexpensive rate and extremely pleasant staff made up for downfalls. There are alot of really young infants and toddlers so you will hear a lot of crying. I thought it was rundown for the price I paid. You can see the base from some rooms and it takes less than a minute to get to the gate. It was nestled behind a strip mall and difficult to make a left turn from vehicles coming off route 90. It did what we needed it to do- provide us with a place to stay so we could be there for the AFB graduation. We were told to go to the front desk to get clean ones only to be told they only had one left!! Staff was wonderful but I like to stay in a place I could relax in. They k re graduation info and supplied us with the info. But was expecting a bigger room.. one that was separate.. bed and then a sitting area... Had to wake up early because my spouse wakes up early This hotel was great for the location of where we needed to be every day. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but there was decent coffee. Our bathtub did not drain first night but I told the front desk and they notified maintanance. It is definitely not worth what we paid for it! If you're staying there for the AF BMT graduations, then it's hard to beat location wise. The location was good, close to the Air Force Base. Graduates, I decided to book a room just for this sole purpose for my 4 night stay. Their non smoking room smelled of cigarettes and was filithy. This hotel is an extended stay meaning, families of what seem to be migrant workers live at this hotel. When I told the staff they told me that it's a San Antonio thing. Were informative on places to see and eat, and also where not to eat. They were definitely not as fast or neat as other hotels but it was about 6 miles from SeaWorld. The room I stayed was very clean but could use a little bit of updating/remodeling. My stay was Wednesday night til Monday morning for my son's Air Force BMT graduation. Had a fantastic 4 day stay, little more cleaning, but service was excellent. The cost of the washer was $1.50, which wasn't bad, plus they sell Tide and Downy at the front desk for $1.00 a piece (which you may want to buy two of, as one doesn't really do the job). A 24-hour front desk is present, as well as fitness and laundry facilities. Gave an overall 3 out of 5 mainly due to price. Places off base we are and that I'd recommend:  Delivery- Papa Johns (took 30 mins both times we ordered)  Riverwalk- Joe's Crab Shack  Riverwalk/Market Square- Mi Tierra Cafe y Panaderia** Highly recommenD We did not stay for breakfast, so I have no review of that. Our TV wasn't working the first night and they sent maintenance right up to fix it. I requested a smoking room,an it wasn't,so the hotel took 200 dollars for me smoking...Not Kool... The shower drain plug didn't work well and the hotel itself could use some updating. The La Quinta Inn San Antonio Lackland serves a free continental breakfast, and coffee or tea in the lobby. It's a motel and in the south and people from all over come to stay, so what do you expect?? Convenient location right next to base.comfortable and adequate but not too clean. Sink is clogged up  Bathroom is dirty  Beddings has stain Breakfast was good. Luke Gate (24 hrs) for the base is 2-3 mins down the rd. Hotel could use some upgrades, front desk was helpful with directions. Had to drive or trek over to the dining room each morning. We had to call and have someone come change the sheets and clean the toilet. I chose this hotel to try and avoid being caught in traffic during the ceremonies. The bathroom has a standing shower; the shower head needed cleaning, and the hot water was not immediately available. I got some decent sleep and felt rested the next morning. We had to constantly wear footwear so that our socks would not soak through. The hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful, but the hotel was old and dirty. The dryers also were $1.50 for 30 minutes of dry time...but you'd better bring a lot of quarters because they don't really dry very well in that time. The bathroom was very smalll, but the room was clean. However, the front desk attendant was very accommodating and asked her cleaning staff to get a room ready for me. We had no other issues the rest of the time were were there. However, my WORST fear came about on my 3rd night:  A ROACH!!! Knowing that everyone was coming for the Airforce BMT Graduation. This particular La Quinta is a motel - with the doors being on the outside of the building. Right next to the pool, though never had the opportunity to utilize it. Room was cleaned well every day but the smell never went away The Alamo, SeaWorld San Antonio and the San Antonio River Walk are within 16 kilometers from the hotel. The toilet need replaced as there were black marks in the biwl. Kind of dated, very small pool outdoors, etc.. nothing very fancy about it, but we weren't there for the hotel. However for the price I didn't expect it to be a 5 star. But during our one night stay, I had to crush TWO roaches. Room was clean, beds were comfortable, breakfast was delicious, and we were just minutes from the Air Force base, which was wonderful considering how stressful it is to drive around San Antonio! The front desk and the person (Fernando - I think) were very nice about the situation. La Quinta always has the friendliest staff and it’s important a they’ve are pet friendly Pest in room and parking was too close to other vehicles Traffic is super bad so plan accordingly, book a better hotel. Shower was not adequate, staff not able to address unavailable wi-fi over entire stay, only benefit was hotel was close to AFB And the drive to Sea world was less than 15 minutes depending on the GPS used. Linens were freshly laundered  (I did the sniff test beforehand) and the bathroom was squeaky-clean. Unlike other travelers, I don’t spend much time in the hotel to be so judgmental, especially if I’m on vacation so I would definitely stay again. The Lackland Air Force Base is a seven-minute drive from the hotel and downtown San Antonio is a 17-minute drive from it. The front desk can change out cash to coins if needed. Only good thing was that it was close to the Air force base. If you are only concerned with location to the Lackland AFB, then you may want to stay here!! I do not remember even a fence  - did not match star rating. The fridge definitely came in handy for storing snacks and leftovers, while the microwave provided convenience for reheating leftovers. Had to go out in the parking lot to get a connection. Rooms not cleaned on second day .Staff said they had no body to clean the rooms .Dirty hotel..stay away ..overpriced Also, our room was on the second floor, and by the second day, realized that our floor boards leaked water every single day. At first we thought we had dripped water on them from the shower, but then you could actually here the squooshing underneath the slats of the laminate. 1960's format exterior access to rooms with poor sound abatement to car noise. Aside from all of that, the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, and the continental breakfast is very decent. Good thing about this hotel is the location close to the AFB. Not putting too much weight into this but would be a different story if we had kids. Our room was okay but the toilet was nasty with lot of black stains and the flush handle dangling from the tank! There was a prong from a power cord stuck in one of the wall outlets we had to have their electrician/maintainer remove. We were in San Antonio to attend our grandson's graduation ceremony from Air Force Basic training and the hotel was in close proximity to the gate we were to enter Lackland Air Force Base. Hotel is dated but it was the convenience of staying so close to base for me. We had to call everyday to request towels and finally resorted to just buying instant coffee and cleaning our rooms ourselves. They are constantly up and down the urine smelling corridors. The rooms and suites at the hotel are equipped with flat-screen TVs, ironing facilities, desks and coffeemakers. Did not look like the pictures online and was more like a low level Motel then a Hotel. They ran out of washclothes the last 2 days of my stay. We originally booked a hotel on the other side of the road and found out that it was the nastiest place on earth. Right next to the base which makes getting to and in base very convenient. I was already prepared for them, so I was not surprised. About $16 to Uber to the RiverWalk if you decide not to rent a car. This only took 15 minutes, while I waited in the car. Some reviewers forewarned about pests, which I discovered were 3 small, black beetle-like insects, that died instantly with a few droplets of water. From pictures, appears the fitness center consists of a treadmill and elliptical. Great location to stay at for your sons or daughters BMT Graduation the staff will make your stay pleasurable and will help you in many ways to get you inside so you won’t have problems getting to see your Airman for graduation. The room wasnt worth the price i paid for, but i understand it was busy weekend for the city. I don't think it was just 5-6 miles from sea world it was about 8-9 miles. I will say the room was clean and the beds were clean and comfortable. Bathrooms have shower and tub combination with free toiletries supplied. They are very loud and once you add alcohol to this things get really bad fast. the staff is the reason i would stay there again very easy driving direction from the airport ------------ arrived about 11 p.m. and front desk clerk was very pleasant and helpful Being close to a military base they should try their best to make families welcomed and at home to see their service men and women after so many months. If you need to go to Lackland Airforce Base you could not pick a better hotel. It is close to downtown and it has morning breakfast included. We wished the pool stayed open past 10  but we understand noise levels. I did not have a chance to eat breakfast there since I had to leave very early but checking out was super fast and everybody was very helpful and amicable. Great location , easy access everything you need is near by - tight parking along a 8 foot deep concrete spill way. We were able to enjoy both of the pools a  couple of times while we were there. All in all it was ok i guess it was clean. I actually paid for a second hotel to stay in because this hotel was completely unacceptable but I had pre paid so I could not cancel the reservation. Our rooms were not cleaned the entire time we were there. Linens were clean and bed was comfortable but there were bugs in the bathroom... hair in the shower... and the floor by the mini fridge was soaked. Please note: those gates close in the early evening, so you'll have to drive all the way around to the main gate after a certain time. It was also convenient to hwy 90 and I-410 loop. I like laQuinta but didn't realize they had deteriorated so much. A person taking a shower in the next room keeps you from hearing the television in your room. Upgraded rooms also have minifridges and microwaves, and suites have separate living areas with sofa beds. Liked that it was right next to Lackland AFB where we were the entire weekend for my son's graduation. This hotel was dirty with large roaches crawling up the walls as we made our way up to our second story room with no elevator! During our stay, I had to do some laundry for my son (who just graduated from BMT). Room service took our towels and didn't even leave clean ones! Needless to say, we are worried that some got into our luggage. It has an assortment of things to eat from cereal, waffles, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, muffins, bread and bagels that you can toast, jellies, cream cheese, butter, oatmeal, juices, tea and coffee. (The “hot” and “cold” markings are not where you should turn the knob for hot water, so just keep turning - slowly - until you feel the water getting hot.) Baseboards to the shower were bowing and buckling, assume it's caused by water damage and structural flexing. Pros: Pools for kids Inexpensive Location Laundry  Cons: Room amenities Cleanliness/condition  My wife and I stayed a few nights for BMT graduation week. Son graduated from Navy A school at Lackland AFB this was the closest hotel. If your looking for a place near lackland this is the one to stay at. La Quinta Inn San Antonio Lackland is a two-storied hotel in San Antonio, Texas. The outdoor pool had a bit of a green tint to it, and also had a problem with algae, which was actually vacuumed the day that we arrived, but it didn't take long for it to return.
We had a great view overlooking the beach in a room with a handy kitchenette. It’s in a great area near the bay so you can walk everywhere instead of driving If I could rate it higher I would and I can't recommend this place high enough. There are a variety of room styles, ours was a studio with a kitchenette and it met our needs, except that it lacked dishcloths and towels and I felt sad to use the bathroom ones on dishes. I understand people need service animals and they are trained to do their job. The enclosed room was on the opposite side and did not have any ventilation. The hotel is just a short walk to the beach and to Belmont Park. The Bahia is on a peaceful peninsula in Mission Bay with water access in the bay and a host of water toys available. There were multiple pets and just left in the room barking. I couldn't say that much for their front desk staff. There are lots of activities to do on the property. The lighting was awful had to use my phone light to see. The place is nice, location is great and staff was super friendly. We got a suite so the kids could take a nap if needed but it just got too hot with the door closed. The food at the restraunt was terrible on several occasions and the staff there was equally unfriendly. There are lots of tropical trees around, so it makes it very enjoyable. For the price of the hotel, pretty run down rooms. The room was beautiful had its own little kitchen & each room was spacious. The Bahia Belle and her sister vessel the William D. Evans, are 1860s- era sternwheelers that tour guests around the bay during the evening, based upon the current season’s schedule. The hotel bar had a limited food selection but was okay. The private'' beach was just around the building and is good for little kids. It’s kinda old and worn around the edges, but great location on Mission Bay. I would recommend a Bay view room which has a nice balcony and a kitchenette. It was very clean and the chairs around the pool were comfortable. The service at the bar/lounge was very slow because they had only staffed it with one bartender/server and he was attending to 10 tables. The Bahia Resort Hotel is a stunning waterfront property located on a private 14-acre peninsula in San Diego’s scenic Mission Bay. The weather did not allow us to enjoy outdoor recreation that the location offered. The hotel could do some upgrades to the couches and carpet. Mission Beach with all it's glorious sand and surf is two blocks away, we spent a day there, and walked a loop that included the beach each morning. The carpet was old and worn, the bathroom floor tile was very old and cracked, the sofa was sagging and the walls/celing was stained and yellowed. We spent a day relaxing on the beach in the very comfortable cabana chairs. I get there, they gave me a room with view from the kitchen and no view at all from the room. Parking was convenient and it was nice to not have to pay extra for parking and resort fees. We are about mid way through a 2 month road trip across the USA and are here on holidays from Australia. I think they recycle water so it had an egg smell in one area but outside that it was an amazing stay. This hotel is directly on the beach on Mission Bay. Popular guest activities include sailing, stand-up paddle boarding, kayaking, surfing, tennis, and relaxing on the soft sand beaches or by the sparkling pool. The Jacuzzi was the largest we have ever seen and it was nice and hot too! The suite we were upgraded to by Kevin which happened to be a Bay side villa has been by far the most luxurious of anywhere we have stayed (many of which were far more expensive too)   The rooms are huge and the beds are absolutely amazing. How this place isn't a 5 star resort is beyond me. If they can't get it done earlier, then they should hire more maids. One night there was a party on the roof of the building we were in and it was nearly impossible to sleep because of the noise. and upon returning from our first day out to SeaWorld we were greeted with a fruit and cheese platter with a card saying Welcome to So-Cal. They hadn't even mentioned it to us when we checked in. The suite had 1 a/c unit attached to the main area next to the patio door. The pool was good and large enough to do laps. Smell got into clothes for the rest of the trip. The room had a small kitchen which was nice but the cabinet had crumbs and it was rusty and not very appealing. This hotel is in a wonderful location- close to major attractions. From the moment we drove into the resort we were made feel like royalty by the hotel staff. We enjoyed a lot the big hot tub , capacity 33 people, gym , bike rentals, we needed more time to rent a boat and discover the bay. The walls are basically paper thin so you could hear everything perfectly. Great location, the pool and hot tub were perfect, helpful front desk and the studio was perfect for a family. The pool was also large enough to accommodate all the other Spring Breakers. I honestly think we would have been happier at a best western or comfort inn. Wr tried 20 minutes early and could not get in. Tre at the front desk checked us in and matched us with the perfect room for us. No way are you fitting 2 people comfortably on them. It is hands down my favorite place I have ever stayed. First room was in need of some maintenance and was in a not-so-ideal location. With cruises nightly to their sister resort, beach access and even seals on property there's something for everyone! Not what I recalled from previous visits, albeit it was 20 years ago. Other than the issues we had, the rooms were clean and good enough. Loved the beach front location but would have preferred a newer and updated room. If you need all new buildings you will not be happy here. I wasn't looking for slate shower with a rain head, I was looking for peace and quiet, charm, and a place to relax and feel comfortable and the Bahia fulfilled that need in spades. However, the location is pretty much the only good thing about this place. The hotel rooms itself were a little dated expected more for the price. The staff goes above and beyond to meet all needs. The room service / housekeeping is beyond anything I've experienced so far. They have a couple of rescued seal on the property. I do not recommend this hotel and will never stay here again! Staff was great about switching, otherwise I was going to check out. On the photo of the room, it was very clear that the bed had a view! I call the front desk and they tell me they have no other room available. Excellent staff members who come to mind are Michaela, who helped us on the phone before our stay; Aaron, who checked us in and was very accommodating, and Jacob, who throughout our stay was helpful and friendly. This place is definitly dated and could use some renovations. Area was nice and close to a lot of things. Pool was warm and mission bay beach was right across the road. Good, clean, comfortable , we feel happy, have a good view , convinence. We spent much of our time in the chaise lounge chairs on our patio looking at the bay in the evenings. Rooms outdated, light fixture in bathroom rusty, tile cracked, paint on bath towels,air conditioner/ heater very loud. We stay in the regular hotel (not the beach front little hotel homes). The room we had was large, but in desperate need of updating (carpet, sofas). The location of the hotel makes it great for a family visiting Sea World and the local area. I loved the location and set up of the room. I quickly learned this is a young college hotel mostly. They moved us to another one without any issues and without any trouble which we appreciated very much. I had to change rooms, from the one room to a suite. Guests can walk to Belmont Park, an oceanfront amusement park, or opt for a quick ride to nearby attractions including SeaWorld and the San Diego Zoo. Dining options include our signature Mediterranean-themed restaurant Café Bahia, and our Moroccan-inspired Tangier Lounge. It is not a cheap hotel to accept anything other than exactly you have asked for. I had a good experience at your resort  In San Diego Loved that it had water views all around and it’s own private beach. It definitely needs its own a/c or some kind of air flow. The pool is heated and is open late (check with the front desk for hours). All the places we wanted to see were easy to get to from the hotel. Nice hot tub/pool area with FREE arcade room for kids! But it was large enough for a family of four. My kids loved the free wifi and the beach was close. Great hotel in front of the bay & walking distance to mission beach & Belmont Park. I cannot say enough about how great all the staff was. There’s also a private beach with comfortable sitting available for hotel guests. Was a little surprised to see how dated the room was. Otherwise it was clean and had a nice view of the bay. That really started us out on a great foot and nothing disappointed. Featuring friendly service and comfortable accommodations, as well as spectacular views of Mission Bay and lush tropical gardens, the Bahia offers guests a selection of deluxe guest rooms, studios and suites, each with its own balcony or patio. Also, many of the activities were overpriced so we did not attend the beach party or luau. This room will get hot during the day as the sun shines on it. Another problem with our room was that it was in the very back of the complex and behind us was a public parking lot and beach are where homeless people were living. The location was nice but it was not enough to justify the premium price. Kids loved the pool as it is 10 feet at the deep end! I had to call the front desk multiple times and they could not control these parties going on. Great location.. prices higher than should be... We stay here a lot but first time in this particular room type... bed was hard ..room smelled old. The hotel says no pets allowed, yet they have a card to place in the door to say there’s a pet in the room. Overall, the hotel is great & the staff are super helpful. The place must have been beautiful in the late 70s/early 80s, but it feels a bit outdated now. We were greeted by the front desk and they were very nice. Thank you Bahia staff for making us feel welcome and making out stay amazing, had the best birthday ever!! Enjoyed the stay at the resort very clean and a nice view of the fire works for the 4th room floors (carpet could have been cleaner) after a few minutes walking on carpet our feet were black. Pool is open until 11:00, so if you go to SeaWorld or Belmont Park you can still come home and hit the pool! Overall a nice place to stay, especially for a family and I would recommend it. The only negative thing I have to say is I booked a room with a garden view but what I got was a 4th floor view of some palm trees and the maintenance garage. There were lots of free family activities: arcade, ferry ride, movie night, watching the seals, jacuzzi, pool, and tennis! We were so unhappy with our stay and wouldn't ever go back. Unfortunately, the room and interior were very outdated which made the cleanliness seem sketchy. The hotel staff is very friendly and went above and beyond to give us a great experience . Bathroom needs to be updated but it was a good place to stay and I would go there again. Kevin went above and beyond any expectations we had and his customer service is so good I fear the rest of our holiday will be a disappointment compared to how we were treated here. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time. Stayed for a week in August in a Bay View Suite with 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 2 and 4). The hotel was in a nice location but it needs renovations especially the little kitchen and the bathroom and need new beds/new sofa bed. We had a Groupon and Belmont Park was so much fun! We ended up doing the Flowrider for an hour which is a large body/surfboard activity on the boardwalk by the beach! We ended up having to move a few times but Everytime the staff made sure we got a better room and also let us stay another night. While the property seemed a bit dated, the amazing staff MORE than made up for it. I can not thank Kevin enough for his amazing service. This hotel was so nice we got a suite on their private beach & it was great enjoying the view. We could hear the cars driving by from the main road and our room was on another road that had traffic coming through at all hours. We go to San Diego all the time and this was a great experience. The view was very good and we could easily watch the 5 minute fireworks display every night across the bay. We found a dirty sock left in the room by housekeeping. The hotel is right near the bay, a short walk to the beach and centrally located to easily get to San Diego's attractions. We also was given an upgrade to our reservations at no extra charge so we had a Bay beach view and a little cabana! The room was fine but old furnishings seemed like the set for a 70’s movie. The public can access the beach but most will probably head towards the ocean side so it was never crowded. The hot tub was spacious, which was helpful because many guests were sharing it at the same time! The resort has complimentry cruises up and down the Bay as well as 2 resident seals rescued by sea world which the kids got to watch being fed of a morning. Breakfast buffet, I ordered from the menu, and the omelet had a scent that wasn’t great. The downstairs neighbors partied till 2am waking up my child. We did not eat at the onsite restaurant because we wanted to spend as little time here as possible. The room was decent but we were expecting a much nicer facility based on the price we paid. Location was excellent free parking walk to the beach on the bay centrally located......will be staying there again....Staff was friendly. The seal pond was a treat and the grounds are gorgeous. Our first room here had a broken door lock and the water in the tub was rust colored. The AC is the old style that's not even controlled by a wall thermostat, so only one corner of our room would cool down. Sliding glass door to the balcony, you hear every ones when they open and close them. This hotel is located in a magic San Diego spot I did not feel comfortable using any of the utensils or glassware. Time to step it up and remodel the rooms especially when I’m paying $250 a night. We are definitely staying there again I have two boys they loved it, we went paddle boarding, kayaking all offered by the hotel at great prices, we didn't want to leave but we now know where to go for a great stay. The room had double beds and had a sliding glass door out to the garden area which lead to the pool. It is an older facility and it is showing its age in places, but to me that just adds to the charm and delight. We had to regularly call housekeeping to get our room cleaned before late afternoon. Upon arrival Kevin did everything in his power to make sure we had the best room possible and just made us feel like rockstars. We stayed one night and then moved to the grand Manchester Hyatt for the remaining 4 days of our trip. I made sure to choose exactly the room that I wanted with a bay view from my bed. Great place for family   Nice free arcade games. The staff was amazing, we were upgraded to a bay view room at no extra cost, the hotel is beautiful the breakfast was excellent and everything is walking distance to the beach, shops and restaurants. Also, wonderful breakfast buffet- free with bed and breakfast special. What a great place this has been for our spring break! Staff was very attentive and let us switch rooms with no problem. Food sampled in both the hotel restaurants was nicely presented and delicious. Never stayed at this hotel before.Very impressed.Walking distance to beach and restaurants.Short drive to Sea World.Deffinitly will stay here again. The part of the hotel where we stayed was very run down. Very expensive but that is San Diego at a whole. Beautiful area, always love what San Diego has to offer. Vanessa at front desk Check-in made our experience that much better. At night it was bearable but still too warm for our liking  There is a good amount of parking but if it is busy, you will have to do some walking. If you want a nice resort in the BEST location with a fabulous staff, then this place is for you. The only downfall is when we went to the restaurant to try to get dinner, they sat us right away, however after waiting 25 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge us we left. Also thought that charging $54 for Christmas brunch was outrageous, especially when we could drive just a few miles away and get a good breakfast meal AND lunch for a total of about $40. I have booked a room on Expedia since I head this hotel was great. The room did not feel clean due to the humidity and dampness of the carpet and window coverings.
Never again will I step my foot  into another Days Inn. Guests may take advantage of the hotel’s complimentary continental breakfast, and some of the many other nearby dining options include Best of Philly, Villa Romana, Ho Wah Chinese Restaurant and Aladdin Restaurant. While I freak out, my husband throws the blankets on the floor. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME AND STAY HERE. Extension cords and wires hanging and the grout is moldy. I would have left but all other hotels were booked and I had a basketball team with me. I repeatedly contacted Wyndham hotels for them to make my experience right. Its a good hotel to stay at, the distance to the family kingdom is great like a 5 min walk.. just was not satisfied having to shower in cold water Maintenance guy just knocks at your door with no notice. The front desk attendant gave us sheets and towels and said there was nothing else he could do. A piece of paper on the floor, we left it to see what happened, it was there from arrival to departure. I got there and i ask her why she didn't answer my question, the Manager came out, me thinking he would help told me if you don't like the service you can leave. There was no cold water in the shower and it was scalding hot. It got better after the homeless people left their encampment outside my door. I bought room online but couldn't get into a smoking room bc it says non smoking online therefore this is no option that says smoking room. Water pressure in the shower wasn’t great, but it did the job...only took 20 minutes to shower off the soap. Charged us extra $5  made up fee that Expedia didn't cover. We go to put out stuff in the room and we open the,door to a room that wasn't cleaned. The other guests on the others rooms  were interesting , scary and loud. Bathroom not cleaned well, decades of cigarette smoke still in the air. The room smelled like it had been empty for a long time and the bathroom was just nasty. This necessitated an early drive to Denny's for breakfast, which was not free! We ended up  staying most of the day out. The hotel is in the process of upgrading their furniture that made the room noisy during the day. Stained sheets, towels and pillows Bathroom walls, floor and tub filled with black mold Cracks and holes in the walls Door knob literally fell off door frame Electrical outlets missing faceplates The blanket smelled like it was never washed in years. There was hair in the tub and toilet when we arrived. Paid an exorbitant pet fee of US $80 for two small dogs and saw numerous nearby properties with sighns saying small pets free. The sink leaked, telephone ripped out of the wall, no smoke detector, and bed bugs! My husband and I were laying down and all of the sudden I spot a roach on top of me. We spotted 3 roaches and ants inside our room.The bathroom floor was sticky, the tub was dirty, the toilet was stained and looked like it hasn't been clean for a few days. I have stayed in cheaper hotels than this and they were wonderful . I will be coming back here and recommending it to all my friends I mean, if you are going thru the trouble to keep water in it and keep it clean, you might want to heat it a little. It’s not a five star hotel, but who really spends that much time in their hotel room at the beach? We asked twice and were told someone would come to fix them....no one showed. The bathrooms were peeling paint and the bathtubs had water stains. First I rent a non smoking room, they give me smoking room, I’m allergic to that, the room was dirty, the shower was dirty too, what you see online on picture it’s nothing like never stay here again. Clean rooms, housekeeping staff very friendly and do an excellent job. Guests can choose between smoking and non-smoking rooms, all rooms feature free high-speed Wi-Fi, air-conditioning, a small fridge, a microwave, cable TV, a coffee machine, an iron and ironing board, a radio and a hair dryer. People running in and out and up and down the Hall all night and outside the room smoking weed I attempted to contact travelocity (no phone number that I could find anywhere) and when I went to the Travelocity web site and requested a call back I NEVER received one. Stayed in Mid November in a king bed suite room was very large. Our room had bugs in it and it wasn’t very comfortable. Lots of people just hanging out around the outside of hotel. Rooms could use updating carpets and fix up dings but overall was as expected but larger than expected When the cleaning staff didn’t leave us towels, management was quick to respond by giving us what we needed. The roach instantly disappeared and we were looking for the bug for over 10 minutes. Room had no working Air Conditioning; had Sleep number beds that did not function, had no working phone in the room. Travelocity may be good for booking but USELESS for support Had no room service, and paint was peeling from the tub, and shower was just a drizzle. The room was mom smoking and there were cigarettes and ashes all over the table. Really  Dirty, Even if you are in a budget, Do not stay there unless you like  weed smell everywhere  and disrespectful people . We didn't check in until 9 p.m. and there was no housekeeping. The smoke detector beeped in our room until a manager came and pulled it off the wall. Second night was Sunday and with limited traffic, no issues. Don’t think this property was up to normal Days Inn standards. This place is run down and not worth your hard earned cash. The front desk flatly refused to refund me for one night. There was a flood warning and I had to leave early. The tub was painted and the paint was floating around as we showered. First room sand was on the bed second room hair was on the floor only thing was ok was the breakfast. We got evacuated from our room at 10:40 PM up to 1:00 in the morning, Because one guess want to kill himself. The hotel boasts a heated pool, guest laundry facilities, ice and vending machines and on-site parking. I called the FD from my phone asking about the wifi, and phone and the lady was so rude, she hang up when i was asking something. The down side, the sleep number beds didn't work, either of them in our room. Not sure I would take the chance at this hotel again Light fixtures were unplugged; light cord over nightstand was stretched across the front of the headboard, almost on top of the pillow..   No tissues were provided, Restaurant's free breakfast opened at 7:30 on Saturday BUT we had to be at the airport by 7:30. The people/staff's conduct single-handedly flipped what would've been a don't stay recommendation to a fair value for the money recommendation. When we left the room, we saw another roach crawling on the door and it got into the room. This property is in a good location close to the beach, boardwalk and other amusements but is very old and tired. One big negative - doors (which lead to outside, not hallway) don't really stop any noise from coming through. Close to everything you need, beach, amusements, restaraunts all within walking distance. I will let the pictures speak for themselves, unfortunately I can only post 6. Hotel was average, but I would rate it above average with cost factored in. First night was Saturday an people drive up an down the road with loud exhaust. Upon our arrival the staff on the morning shift was ok. Then once we checked in, the room was nasty, old, stink, the bathroom was disgusting, we were scared to sit on the bed. We requested a non smoker room, the room we got stunk cigarette. It was a great price for a family of five on a spur of the moment trip. I contacted Travelocity via their web site, providing an email and contact phone number, on July 2 and still haven’t heard back as of July 5th. The Days Inn Myrtle Beach – Grand Strand is within walking distance of the beach, one mile from the Boardwalk and Ripley’s Believe It or Not, and a ten-minute drive from Broadway at the Beach and the Myrtle Beach International Airport. Now the room stank like a humid cigarette pit, there are roaches here. The Days Inn Myrtle Beach – Grand Strand offers accommodations within walking distance of the Family Kingdom Amusement Park. When we got here, there no one at reception, we have to call a number to get someone to check us in. Coffee pot did not operate where originally plugged in until moved to the bathroom vanity. Our room smelled like smoke and bad air fresheners, but when we turned on the air conditioning it fluffed the odor out enough to not be a bother. We looked under the mattress and we saw a huge whole underneath it and we just  couldn't imagine how many bugs were inside it. In 6 days only the towels were 3 times changed. The mattress was hard as a rock, you could smell weed everywhere and loud people at night. We had some bathroom clogging problems and Zeke fixed it for us! The price wasn't bad, however pay a little more, hopefully you will get a little more. Accommodations were acceptable, but at a days inn, I usually come to expect a little better than the regular run of the mill motels in myrtle beach, not sure I got what I paid for, but it is off season...oh well. The phone don't work, the internet don't work, nothing works. And i have a 1 year old, and my 9 year old brother. 2 days the internet was not working at all until some device was changed. The hotel is in need of renovation but the rooms are clean and the staff is friendly  Also I don't think you can get anything better in the area for the price  The beach it's right  across the street  and on the street  behind the hotel there are plenty of restaurants They allow pets, so there were some stains on the carpets. However, the hotel needs serious upgrade with electric outlets and the bathroom. And when I complained they responded “I guess we won’t see you back”. Then i went downstairs to figure out why are they so rude. Looks like a motel that needs a lot of help. At least I would have got the bang for my money. If I knew they would do that, I would have lived at the mariott. With a little fixing up will be a walk into the 1950's.
The hotel is very close to subway station though, this was a consolation. An elegant dining area offers guests a range of foods to enjoy on-site. We could also hear everything from the streets as if the windows would be open, but luckily the area was quite calm during our stay. A mini-bar is also offered and some also feature floor-to-ceiling windows or skylights. Prague Centre Plaza is a three-star hotel situated just minutes from the 14th-century plaza Wenceslas Square and the iconic Charles Bridge. Other features include meeting rooms, a 24-hour front desk and an airport shuttle service. The nearest metro station is just a five minute walk away, the Charles University is also close by and, for guests interested in fascinating history of this area, the Dvorak Museum is just a few minutes away. The main attraction and most central is the old town square and you can't walk there everyday, you will have to use transportation. Prague Centre Plaza features a spa tub, a sauna and massage treatment rooms. There's no air conditioning so take that into account if you're going in the summer. A complimentary breakfast buffet is also offered or guests can enjoy dining at any of the restaurants nearby including Etnosvet. This is a small hotel, located not really in the center... We had shown your confirmation mail still they were asking for payment. The hotel was located within a walking distance from the city center, but still on rather calm area. All in all price was low so it's good value for money if you don't expect prime location. Although we were having reservations they told no room is booked in our name. Guest rooms are equipped with Wi-Fi, flat-screen television and tea and coffee making facilities. Me and friend stay in hotel plaza in March .it was nice clean warm and cosy . the stay was nice and the breakfast was so tasty but the staff was not so friendly Our room was better than we thought based on the pictures, but we had holes on our sheets and the windows did not have any insulation, which resulted a cold breeze from the windows. We have not seen any room boy during our stay.
I think this is a good hotel, we just happened to have run into unusual issues. I stayed nearby hotels of similar type, where there is no parking charge for the guests.So, next time Residence Inn may not be my choice. The Residence Inn by Marriott San Diego Sorrento Mesa-Sorrento is an all-suite hotel located within six miles of the University of California-San Diego and the Birch Aquarium. We had a full suite with two bedrooms, each with a barhroom, and a living room and full kitchen. The next day they did not run the dishwasher but left dish soap. During my stay my room was not serviced the first night. The other times the room was cleaner than this time. As it was, we had to have a carpet dryer for a day but they did not pick it up for two days, I had to call them. Nice hotel with pleasant room, bit away from most facilities as on a business estate, but on the plus side was quiet with free parking and close to freeway. Next day the other toilet clogged but did not flood. However, the air conditioning was a bit loud and for some reason, on the second day I wasn't able to get on the internet. Check in and parking was fast and easy, breakfast was decent, and the pool was ok but seems to need a facelift (the ladder bar were super wiggly and rusted). Close to the hospital where our family member is now. Hotel is old looking but has other perks, such as breakfast, bites in the evening (similar to a light dinner), pool, small gym, basket ball/tennis court. But I had to call every day for something the housekeeping missed. The hotel features a business center and a heated outdoor pool. The front desk was corteous and quick every time I called. Very friendly service at the front desk for check in and check out. We stayed this last time for a quick weekend . Will stay here again if I need a room in the area. The rooms are spacious and having a mini kitchen is so useful. Very pleased with the room and met all my travel needs. The only part I didn't like was the location because it was farther from places. Everything was great here, would stay here again in the future. The amenities were good, the room was fresh and the bed/bed linens were clean and welcoming. Staff was more then helpful and pleasant housekeeping did a great job.. one thing they do need to get the laundry room / dryers fixed asap only one working making it hard to dry clothes waited 2 hours to dry clothes The hotel offers studio, one, and two-bedroom suites, each one equipped with amenities such as full kitchens, 42” flat-panel TVs, and complimentary Wi-Fi. My friend had come all the way from the UK to celebrate her 50th birthday when we told the front desk, they gave us a bottle of wine. We have a family of five so the two bedroom suite was perfect for us. We had 6 girls in the 2 bedroom suite and it was perfect! The only thing I didn't like was people from unit upstairs were so noisy, other than that everything was fine. I had to call for dish washer soap every day but the first, and for towels several times, for toilet paper once. And their breakfast is surprisingly delicious and complimentary ..yes complimentary! We loved our cozy studio Nice big screen TV Cool style The only thing is the bushes surrounding the pool have many bees. I called front desk but they did not show up for half an hour. The room was ready less than 1/2 am hour later,  thank goodness Nearby dining options include the Karl Strauss Brewing Company, Chili’s Grill & Bar, and El Torito. The first day our room was fully serviced and the dishwasher was run. One thing I did not like is the parking charge of $8 per night. Bees were trying to build a nest in the water spout off the Jacuzzi. They have a light snack hour from Monday to Wednesday, nice if you don't want to go out. Facilities at the Residence Inn by Marriott San Diego Sorrento Mesa-Sorrento include a fitness room, a sports court, and a hot tub. Everything is good, I will book this hotel if I going to San Diego next time But besides that it was very enjoyable and all the staff were very friendly. We had a group of 5 families and they were able to put us in the same floor so we could stayed together. The hotel lies within ten miles of the Del Mar Race Track, within 16 miles of SeaWorld San Diego, San Diego Zoo, and the Gaslamp Quarter, and 22 miles from LEGOLAND California. Other conveniences include a patio and BBQ area, a convenience store, and free parking. This 2 bedroom suite is perfect for a traveling family. Check in was great and the staff couldn't have been nicer. We enjoyed clean room, very friendly staff, clean BBQ grill, fire places, and basketball court. On this stay, both bathrooms had hair on the floor when we arrived. The last two days we got our beds made but no dishwasher running, no new soap, no shampoo, the table, stove and counter tops were not wiped. If I have not mopped up with towels, the whole bedroom would have flooded. We have stayed at this hotel numerous times And it’s always wonderful. The service was so awesome people are extremely nice and welcoming This is our hotel of choice When we visit San Diego Most guests appeared to be consultants for Qualcomm in the area, and this is very convenient for them. TV remotes were horrible and it was not fun to watch TV with dimmed brightness and color variations. Breakfast had the basics: scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, granola, coffee and tea
The window didn't close properly there was a one-two cm gap so the wind blew in and was rather cold. The hotel serves both a full English and continental styled breakfast for guests in the breakfast room. The room could have been so much better - it was okay but tatty and in need of some tlc. This was on a March day when outside temp was close to zero or maybe even below at night. there was no duvet in the room just an old smelly worn out blanket. Shabby, dated, not enough sockets to charge devices,  carpet didn't cover the whole floor, tv didn't work, bathroom sink in bad repair, beds uncomfortable and squeaky. Was only after something secure simple and clean so was satisfied.. the only issue was my window having a basement room and the only window being to a internal courtyard where people seemingly dropped cigarettes out their windows so there was smell of smoke which was my only issue... gave the place a dodgy feel but other than that reasonable budget accommodation... good access to tube a boris bike station... Poor and wouldn’t stay again even if it were free. very nice hotel close to city centre nice breakfast will return on my next trip to london. Hyde Park is practically at the doorsteps of the hotel, with shopping along Kensington’s High Street across the park. i should have read reviews of previous guests before l booked because their reviews were all similar to mine. This really was the worst description of a so  called hotel. The bed and breakfast-styled hotel is family run with a 24 hour concierge service and luggage storage. Worst hotel ive stayed in room was cold there was only a sheet on bed The room was in the basement with a door lock that really didn't want to work until the key was at just the right angle. My room was so cold as the only way to worm up was hot shower. Shoddy room, taps Loose on sink, room door very flimsy and quick push would fall through, beds awful,old and uncomfortable, kids beds noisy on moving slightly,  staff uttered a few words throughout booking in and not one on booking out. Coffee and tea making facilities looked like they were just thrown on a cupboard top. A tube station is right by the The Apollo for easy access to the rest of the famous city. The day after that, the receptionist confused me with another guest and tried to fine me £160. Was old and run down hotel that needs refurbishment and cleaned. The front desk didn't have a card machine so I was informed I had to go and get cash. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option, this hotel may be a good choice. After returning to the Apollo hotel the next day, I was given the wrong room and then asked to move to another room. The replacement room I got in exchange was cold, there was no central heating only a tiny oil radiator. That said, be aware of what you're getting yourself into. Tried to tell them there were bed lice and that we were bitten. The price-per-night was nice and the location is convenient, but I don't think it was worth the hassle in the long run. I think it is all I would do in this hotel. There is no bar or restaurant but ask the staff about great places to eat nearby. Only had low expectations, just a cheap night away, but managed to disappoint me. The windows don’t close, the bedding is ancient, a very embarrassing place for tourists to stay When I went to check out early on the last day, the receptionist was sleeping on the couch in the lobby and seemed upset when I woke him to ask for check-out instructions. All guest rooms have en-suites, TV, telephone, tea and coffee making facilities, a hairdryer, free Wi-Fi at a rate with modern furnishings and facilities. I've been sleeping in cheap London hotels like this and even cheaper since November 2016 but this was the first where I found bedbugs. It was a one night stay and I would not have wanted to stay any longer If this was listed as a hostel, I'd say, good, clean, basic, affordable. On the whole you get what you pay for - a cheap hotel to lay your head for the night. The rug in the room as well as the bed smelt. We had to leave after 1 night as it was filthy, the furniture was broken and the light fittings looked dangerous. The The Apollo Hotel London offers affordable accommodation located just off Bayswater Road and London’s famous Hyde Park. After I had completed my check-in, I was told there was a water problem (evident by the mattresses and rotting wall board lined up against the lobby wall) and that I'd have to spend the first night at another hotel. Needed a hotel in london to just sleep after meeting friends and travelling away from home. the worse stench l have ever experienced came from the toilet. I would have expected at least a partial refund for having to change room at 10pm, but except a sorry we didn't know there are bedbugs and will not happen again there was no action.
Each apartment comes with a basic breakfast pack on arrival including cereal, milk, tea, coffee, shortbread/flapjack and water. Superb basement apartment however I booked a 'city view' room and none of the SACO staff I called on my arrival (no staff are present at this establishment on a radical) pursued my issue. I would stay here again however I'd like to have the room I book. SACO St Pauls - Red Lion Court offers accommodation in London. Theatre Royal Drury Lane is 800 metres from SACO St Pauls - Red Lion Court, while Lyceum Theatre is 900 metres from the property. All units feature a seating area with a flat-screen TV, iPod docking station, and DVD player. A microwave, a toaster and refrigerator are also featured, as well as a kettle. The basement room didn't have any air conditioning and it was very warm. There is also a kitchen, fitted with a dishwasher and oven. The nearest airport is London City Airport, 11 km from SACO St Pauls - Red Lion Court.
The kids were so disappointed after waiting all day we let them get in anyway. Clean room, excelent staff, breakfast was ok. Hotel price reasonable. The receptionist should have stated, Sir, you will park in back of the hotel. The description of the rooms on hotels.com said the rooms had two queen beds. Wife left behind some items, she called the front desk and was told items would be sent to our house. They need to give these rooms a thorough cleaning with bleach and a vacuum. The second reason was there is no restaurant or bar and grill within walking distance and very few options for food delivery. The helpful assistance of other hotel personnel was, however, fully evident. Only making the bed, leaving trash on the tables, and leaving the iron and ironing board pulled out instead of stored away in it's place. We have stayed in many hotels around San Antonio and some are better than others but we won't stay here again. The bathroom door was rotting and there was rust and flaking paint on the door jam. There are locations within driving distance for other food and drink. After taking them in to shower off I pointed it out to the receptionist and she said they had just treated the pool. Have stayed at this hotel before while visiting family in San Antonio. Only there for 1 night, but it was in a great location for what I needed I choose this hotel over others that only had double beds based partly on this fact since one of the gentleman in our party is over six feet tall and needed a room with two beds. Stayed here for a few hours after going to a concert and the room was clean and the staff was very friendly. Check-in time was 3:00 p.m., but our room was not ready. My kids enjoyed swimming in the pool and pool was clean. All total, the experience was not the best and not the worst. I probably will not choose to stay at this hotel again. If you need a baggage cart, one will be inside the back entrance for your convenience. I was disappointed by this hotel for two reasons, first it was listed as an airport hotel and it didn't have an airport shuttle. I would have given this hotel 5 stars if there had not been three small issues: 1) very noisy fan in bathroom that became even louder, 2) depleted box if tissues after using only two, with no backup in room, and 3) way too crowded of an eating area at breakfast--- smallest I've ever seen! One should not treat a guest in that fashion, but should be ready to go the extra mile, especially when the request is small. Last week im in vegas staying at the Delano in a suite, this week in San Antonio at the holiday inn??? The tub had a really tough time draining and filled up with ankle deep water when we took showers. The air-conditioned rooms feature flat-screen TV, ensuite, hairdryer, phone, desk, free Wi-Fi, refrigerator, microwave, tea and coffee maker, ironing set and daily housekeeping. An employee kept pacing around waiting for us to leave even though we arrived there at 9AM and breakfast ended at 9:30. Holiday Inn Express & Suites San Antonio-Airport North is near points of interest like North Star Mall, SeaWorld San Antonio, Six Flags Fiesta Texas, the Shops at LaCantera and corporate locations like Chase, Tesoro and Valero. Regarding the breakfast, the cinnamon rolls had a hard outer layer. Breakfast lady not helpful at all with a very bad face at all times. Holiday Inn Express & Suites San Antonio-Airport North is minutes from the San Antonio Zoo. We had to wait an additional 15 or 20 minutes for a room to become available. Suites are also available in feature extras like sofa beds, microwaves and refrigerators. One of our rooms didn't have any towels and we had to call the front desk and have some brought up. Shortly after the kitchen was officially closed, but while the door to the hostess quarters was still open, my wife asked for a minor accommodation with regard to her coffee and was curtly refused by an unsmiling and unfriendly hostess, because the kitchen is now closed. The pool was so cloudy you couldn't see the bottom. The free breakfast was lacking but at least it was hot. The wood dresser where the refrigerator was was splitting at the bottom. I didn't get a chance to try to the continental breakfast because we woke up too late. The hotel was filled with guests, but there was only one elevator. Since my car was in the front of the hotel, I had to push the cart around the building to my car in order to unload my baggage onto the cart. This hotel does not have any queen beds in their hotel. Great staff and good water pressure in the shower that's always a plus for me. Called hotel and spoke to receptionist who confirmed she would have a room. The room was very small and the shower was full of mold and mildew. There were no signs at the pool warning swimmers that the water had just been treated. Guests can enjoy an Express Start Breakfast buffet at no charge. While the facade looks good, there was mildew in the bathroom, thick wads of dust behind the furniture and humid in the room, even with the air on. The smoke-free hotel offers free parking, limited front desk hours, front desk safe, laundry facilities, dry cleaning service, ATM, meeting rooms, business center, fitness center, ice machine, outdoor swimming pool and spa tub. Soon after checking in we took our children to the pool which looked beautiful in the pictures. Had requested room with accessibility for sister who was in a wheel chair. Very clean the only thing that did not work was the dryer other than that everything was good Baggage carts were located next to the back door rather than in the entrance area of the hotel. Unfortunately, the wait for an elevator around checkout time was inordinately long and frustrating. After a few minutes in the pool they starting itching and breaking out in hives. hotel was beautiful but could have done without the frog croaking all night. It was in a quiet part of town and the check in process was very easy.
Nice hotel near beach, very nice and clean room and I love the bathroom, hardwood floors, full size mirror on the back of closet and very comfy bed. I have only written great reviews before and this is my first negative experience worth writing about. Great location for those seeking a Miami Beach experience in a more serene way. Lastly, and the most annoying was a squeaky bathroom door. The valet personnel seemed under-trained but the rest of the staff, especially the bar and restaurant staff excelled at making us feel at home. The air conditioner seemed to quit and the room temp got hot/humid. Also, if you want to sue the shuttle, you have to make a reservation FOR THE SHUTTLE ahead of time. Also it was quite close to south beach and ocean drive. There were a few minor issues with our room, that we wanted taken care of. We stayed here for my birthday weekend just my friend and I. Thank you for making my sweetheart’s birthday weekend special and memorable! I arrived here around 2:45 pm right before check-in I was very tired from driving and stressed from all the traffic I am not used to. It was just that the rest of the hotel still seemed a bit seedy. On the first night, the valet got into an accident with my rental vehicle when going to park. This really changed the trip and my feeling about hotels.com guaranteeing rooms for amy future stay - I will reconsider booking through them. Room Odee small for the price they made me think I had a bigger room then what I Paid for Bed was a little to soft but not a big deal. Overall my hotel stay was non eventful, but I would have appreciated a better attitude from the front desk Hotel Facilities and Condition is very old and backward, and my room is very small. Only thing did not like  my room across for elevator heard other people conversations thin walls. I have never been treated so rudely and with such disrespect ever. I highly recommend using Uber or not a bad walk to South Beach. We arrived 4 hours before check in time but we were able to use the hotels facilities while we waited which was awesome! The double rooms didn't have much space to move around and the pool was very average. Also, the room does not have napkins, only have toilet paper, so you have to bring it yourself. Close enough but far away enough from the hustle and bustle. But when the rooms were finally ready they were going to put us on floors 2 and 3. The staff at the hotel were AWESOME, so kind and inviting and helpful at every shift we encountered. Each time my wife or I used the bathroom in middle of the night, the other one woke up. visited with my daughter and had a very good time. It took ages to sort out and some insisting from us. Highlights (onsite): Clean room/very comfortable King bed Onsite Tavern restaurant open 23 hours a day  Romantic view of the stars on the rooftop deck FREE happy hour for guests everyday 1-2 block proximity to the beach FREE Miami Beach trolley stops in front of hotel Already mentioned friendly staff but worth noting again  Other: Versailles for great Cuban food (Calle ocho) Ball & Chain (live music/club) LT Steak & Seafood at the Betsy hotel I would like to see a fan in the bathrooms thought. Nice amenities - free yoga class on Saturday, with an excellent instructor; rooftop area with great views; 1 block from the beach; free cocktail hour. However we were the first ones to check in that morning and we asked for a top floor room and were told it shouldn’t be a problem. I loved everything about Croydon, the service was great we arrived early from our cruise and they allowed us an early check in, we relaxed on the beach that is literally 1 block away on lounge chairs that are included for guests. I stayed for four nights and my room was never cleaned and I never received fresh linen or towel. Restaurant open 24 hrs a day and it goes out to a patio on Collins Ave so if you want sleep don’t get a room on the front, especially on a lower floor. Nice and quiet, away from South Beach madness, but right on the free trolley line. The location, staff and amenities were perfect if you are vacationing with your significant other. It was greatly appreciated, that's is to the hotel staff. The hotel set up the room for me with flowers, rose petals and a bottle of champagne. I paid more than 100 dollars of parking in three nights. I'm 18 and I know I was being taken advantage of. The rooms however are very nicely appointed, with a very contemporary clean look! also the restaurant is poorly managed - we ate there 3 days and it was easy to see they need more help - it took 1 hour to get a caprese sandwich and no one to get coffee - they have a coffee station that is not set up. But when we checked in, we were told the double bed booking wasn't guaranteed (which was identified no where in our email confirmation) so we would have to pay $40/night if we wanted anything other than one king bed. Great spot for nighttime and you can take food from the restaurant up there. Hotel Hotel Croydon offers four-star luxurious accommodations in the Mid-Beach area and has recently been voted as one of Miami's top ten "best new hotels." location and price in main reason why I pick the hotel, I am happy with my picked. We went with the valet but weren't happy about it. I have yet to get an itemized bill for my stay. There seemed to be a lack of staff working at this hotel. The room was clean and the hotel staff was wonderful. The hotel was right across the street from the beach, they have a bar and a restaurant, although we didn't eat there the food looked and smelled great. We were with another couple and their room was ready at 4:00 so we went there. The lobby and all the public areas (pool, restaurant, etc.) I reported this each of the 3 mornings that I was there, and it was never fixed. I was put on the second floor which I was uneasy about. The first night, the AC was not working, it is very hot. I was told I needed to drive around for a half hour before I could check-in. There is  few power plugs, especially bedside the bed  there is no power plug. When they did our door would shake as if they opening ours. I complained and it got better for about an hour. He further stated that we never brought it up with maintenance, when we clearly did! Not too far from South Beach and across the street from a great beach with food and drinks delivered to you on the beach. We were able to book a day trip to key west with the help of the staff, they helped us with the sightseeing tours and we had a good stay. The boutique hotel offers over one hundred double rooms and penthouse suites with views of the ocean that can accommodate a party of four. We had a great stay, the rooms were very nice and clean, the beds were super comfy and spacious. All the benefits of Miami Beach (cross the steer and you're at the beach!) The rooms feature top quality bedding and furnishings, iHome docking station, flat-screen TV, and designer bath products. All hotel staff were amazingly kind, the restaurant and coffee shop sold qualitly food and beverages. The staff was the worst I have ever experienced in my life. I spoke to the manager in the morning he offered to move me but said it is a quieter room and my neighbor left that morning that he would put someone else there that day. It took us about 10 minutes from hotel to parking area. Also, The front desk staff never answered the phone and were not very helpful in sharing where anything is in the hotel. The check in was very slow and our room wasn’t ready until 5:00. Our neighbor opened and shut there door about every minute! are small, compared the the big name hotels on the Miami Strip. That night we had a young couple partying in their room openekng and shutting their door constantly! The hotel charges over $40 to valet park your vehicle. Loved the cute coffee shop and the onsite restaurant... hotel is walking distance to the beach.. staff is extremely friendly...just a great experience!! the staff was friendly the room was nice and clean! The rooms are clean and the beds are super comfy! Since we had arrived at 9:30 a.m it was a pain but they stored our bags. Then they started playing videos in the hallway on their phone. It's a shame the hotel didn't have room service, otherwise I would of agree'd with the 3.9 star review. I booked 5 rooms with 9 people groups, spend 2 days in Miami. Check-in and checkout: Lázaro, Franklin, Junior & Preston made it an easy breeze, thank you all! My friend and i had a great 3 days at hotel Croydon. The price we paid made sense for what the hotel offered. There are much better places to stay in South Beach. Small work and this would have been a much better stay. we paid a fee to have an extra guest in the room but when we went to get chairs to sit on the beach, they wanted us to pay extra for another chair. Miami beach is a two-minute walk away with various clubs nearby. It really is just a lack of respect for other people. They have a heated pool, which was perfect for a quick dip. You hear most of your neighbors while you’re inside your room The only problem with the room was one of the double beds was like sleeping on a marshmallow it was painfully soft. A very good hotel, possibly best budget option in the 4 star range (though it used to be cheaper). We were going to the hotel for a trip with friends and for a wedding- however our friends were moved to another area because the hotel overbooked  we were not able to have dinner together or breakfast because Miami is too hard to get around by car. The room was immaculate and nicely updated, we hung out on the roof that had great beautiful views. The rooftop was quite fun and chill although the view was nothing special. I don’t like a lot of noise but was told that it was a quiet room. I had to deal with the entire incident and pay out of pocket up front for damages while waiting for reimbursement from the other driver's insurance. Guests are invited to enjoy the on-site holistic spa and fitness centre, relax in the pool area, or have a drink amongst friends on the rooftop terrace with views of the sea and Miami. A broken plug for the desk area, which they fixed right away, a clock that had the wrong time (and even me being quite tech savvy, could not change), which they tried but never fixed. They did give us a late checkout because of that. The food too was good, and the beach is very close to the hotel. I was happy with the hotel location and it was great that the beach was just a short walk away. It took them one hour to bring my car to me upon check out, which i had to pay $40 for this service. What was really upsetting, and frankly insulting, is that we mentioned this to the Hotel Manager, Roberto, he said that it could not be. very friendly staff, and the restaurant at main floor is huge plus for this hotel, 7pm - 8pm happy hours free drink is the reason we stay in the hotel for dinner 2 night in a row. Hotel restaurant wasn't bad, which is usually all you can ask for in a hotel restaurant. It was a very bad tasting ending to an otherwise nice trip. The room was small too, you barely can walk in the room. They do have a rooftop, however the night we wanted to go up there was a wedding and we didn't get to see it, however the MOD suggested we go to the 7th floor observatory, which was just as beautiful. I love the boutiqueyness of the hotel and the free shuttle to airport, access to the boardwalk and beach chairs- the restaurant needs front end help ( maybe a few bus servers) it has a good feel to it - it is a shame we ended our trip without spending time with our friends who were moved to the tradewinds - which by the way, is a rundown place to stay - we did a lot of research to choose this hotel - I am very concerned that this can happen. I did for a while and ended up parking my car in the street going in and basically telling them I wasn’t waiting anymore. The pool area was pretty small, and I was only tempted to swim in it once considering the beach was so close. It was clean and lined with plenty of spaces to sit and/or lay down. The overall hotel was nice, but the staff was horrible. The Hotel Hotel Croydon has a full-service restaurant and bar with late night service and a happy hour with complimentary drinks. But it would have been nice, if it would have been done courteously, instead of just lying to us. The hotel is close to all the major things to do in Miami for a short car/Uber ride. It was a great choice  and the staff was VERY FRIENDLY. One concierge, one bartender for happy hour drinks, only a few servers in the restaurant. I travel between 8-12 times a year and I have never stayed in a hotel like this before. Was a little apprehensive when we pulled up because I thought we were more in South Beach but I think Mid-Beach was better for us. Either we had to pay the meter every three hours or pay for valet parking. The hotel still charged the $42.80 to park the vehicle.
They are individually designed in a grand style and feature antique furnishings alongside the very latest in state-of-the-art facilities. Best hotel in Vienna, location, staff, service is absolutely five star. In addition, one morning our coffee cups which had a revolting egg smell. From the first moment to the last we were treated with exceptional service by friendly staff. This is the second time we have enjoyed our stay!! Again, this is rather unusual for a 5 stars hotel where giving options and choice to the guest is paramount. Services, some of which are complimentary, include a spa and wellness centre, as well as a business centre. Such a delicious variety of breakfast items including the famous Sacher Torte. The residents' lounge was gorgeous as was the green restaurant where we had a fabulous meal. We spent three nights at the Sacher to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and a significant birthday. One of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed in, real old-world glamour. We were required to pre-book it however, at no time, we were asked if we had any food allergies in order to ensure that all guest can enjoy the ‘set menu: this was rather difficult as one of us is dairy intolerant and therefor This is a rather unusual set-up for a 5 stars hotel. And of course the Cafe Sacher, and a Sacher torte is a must! We ordered a Strudel and a glass of champagne amongst other food. It lies less than 400 metres from The Vienna State Opera and is a popular haunt for celebrity guests. Have stayed at several excellent hotels in Vienna and this was the best. Although this is an iconic hotel, it is not a place I would recommend to a guest that expects a 5 stars hotel experience nor a quite stay, away from the crowds. The Cafe Sacher Wien offers an appetising start to the day and an introduction to Vienna’s coffee-house culture. The Strudel was cold and the paste like chewing gum and the champagne was “flat” and not cold enough. Very beautiful  hotel in the traditional Grand style of Old Vienna. We felt very cared for and enjoyed a small slice of the ‘Grand life’. The staff were, without exception, all charming and most helpful. It is less than 800 metres to the many stalls at the vast 16th-century Naschmarket and to the mediaeval catacombs of St. Stephen's Cathedral. The waiting time was long, the cups were dirty and the tea pot chipped in addition we had tourist starring persistently through the window and taking pictures of the guest – which should not be allowed. The rooms they served our daily breakfast made us feel like royalty. The hotel offers several restaurants, bars and café however there is no area dedicated to the hotel guests only, as a result we were forced to rely on luck to be able to enjoy even any of the sitting areas. Restaurant Green Bar is the on-site venue for traditional dining with an international twist. Currency exchange and the airport shuttle are arranged via the 24-hour front desk. Everything worked, everything was elegant, beautiful and just as importantly eminently practical. Concierge helped us make reservations for dinner before we arrived and got back to us quickly. Opened in 1876, the luxury Hotel Sacher Wien has always blended harmoniously into the world’s most famous waltz city. Every morning we had breakfast at the hotel, however the only option was a rather expensive buffet. Finally, we had the Christmas day lunch based on a ‘set menu’ at the hotel.
The teceotion irganised everything beautifully , found it next to the safe & irganised a FEDEX pick up & delivery ever so helpfully!! Hotel let us in early, but was disappointing and tiny. Wifi was very fast, not that you're in the room too much with so much to do. Had we had more time I would have loved to explore the neighborhood a lot more. Everything you would want to see is within walking distance. Although we communicated with them in French, we heard them interacting with other guests in English and their English is perfectly fine. If you're not in the mood for eating out all the time, there's a Carrefour market about two blocks away that has every food and drink you could possibly want. Very kind and helpful staff when one member of our party was taken ill.  Couldn't have asked for more. Hotel did not have an adaptor I could borrow for charging my phone. The hotel is convenient to attractions and bars and restaurants. Our toilet and bathroom were split into two rooms, not unexpected in France but apparently the only room on our floor with that arrangement. Hotel is tucked away just off the Boulevard St. Germain, not far from the Odeon metro station. I forgot my purse in my room & went back to London without it. If you like the left bank, 15 minutes from Notre Dame, Latin Quarter, Luxembourg gardens, in the heart of St. Germain des Pres, this lively, lovely boutique can't be beat. Hôtel de Fleurie is well-located on the popular left bank of the River Seine and is positioned in the centre of the Saint Germain area. The Boulevard St. Germain itself offers a huge amount of other shopping opportunities. Just off Boulevard St Germain, less than 2 mins walk from Odéon stop on Metro 4, direct line from Gare du Nord. The hotel provides guests a 24-hour front desk, multilingual staff, safety deposit box, luggage storage, meeting rooms, business centre, babysitting service, laundry, bicycle rental, car hire, tour desk, concierge service and nearby parking garage. Attractions like the Louvre, Tuileries Gardens and Notre Dame Cathedral are nearby. Hôtel de Fleurie, off Saint Germain Quarter, is within walking distance to local shops, public transit and the Luxembourg Gardens. I wasn't familiar with that area of town but was very pleasantly surprised. Food options at the hotel include a breakfast buffet and in-room breakfast service, with other eateries nearby. Location was central but slightly off the beaten path so it was quiet. We were pleasantly surprised by the quaint and quiet little hotel with an abundance of charm sitting off one of the main streets of Paris. The bed was large enough to sleep the two of us comfortably. Through a mistake on our part, they went out of their way to help us several days after we left for home. Parisian styled, air-conditioned rooms feature satellite TV, free Wi-Fi, telephone, minibar, in-room safe, ensuite and hair dryer. Our room was a little small and sparsely furnished, but comfortable and clean. The bathtub was small, though, not long enough for me to straighten my legs out while seated (I'm 6'4/1.95m). Perfect place to come back to after a long day of exploring the city! On our next visit to Paris be sure we will book Hotel de Fleurie. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, quiet room to use as a home base to explore Paris. There are plenty of wonderful restaurants located around the hotel which felt very safe yet lively at night. Hotel de Fleurie is a great little hotel with adequately sized rooms and friendly service. The rooms on the street can be a bit noisy, but they are larger than rooms away from the street. There's a very nice bakery just around the corner to the south, and restaurants galore within a two-block radius of the hotel. St. Sulpice and the Luxembourg Gardens are within a short walk to the south, and the Seine, Ile de France, and Notre Dame are about a ten minute walk to the north. Also, just around the corner is a small bakery where you'd pay just to walk in and breathe. Smallish room but excellent facilities inc fridge and mini bar.
Each air conditioned suite features a fully equipped kitchen with utensils. I also requested an Allergy Free Room, which was ignored. We really enjoyed our stay there, and enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. The Staff was very accommodating and tried to assist in any way:) A suggestion only, to please keep all the animals on 1 floor and in a certain area only. Situated only 1.5 km from The University of Central Florida, Residence Inn Orlando East/UCF Area features free on-site parking as well as complimentary Wi-Fi throughout. These hotel rooms are dated in both furnishings and finishes. The housekeeping staff does a great job of keeping them fully stocked with all the necessities, especially in the kitchen area. Probably a much better deal if I had my family, and wanted to take the time to cook. Residence Inn Orlando East/UCF Area features an outdoor pool with a hot tub as well as a fitness centre with free weights. The property had a leak in their pipes which shut off the water for hours without warning. The room was sufficient if you need a place to stay near UCF. So, staff stole and didn't care about what I felt. Hotel staff did nothing to solve the problem of water coming through the floor in the kitchen and wet carpeting. Another concern was that Pets were allowed in the Hotel, which I don't mind, but what about Fleas, Pet Dander and Noise Control to the other Guests who have Allergies or don't want to hear a dog barking at 3.00 am in the morning. I did not make use of the kitchen but having a full size refrigerator in your room makes a lot of noise so I had to turn that off. I could've ended up in the Hospital, which happened before with another Hotel. This hotel is located in Quadrangle Office Park and within walking distance to Lockheed Martin. That did not help my family out during our stay. It took a long while to bring sheets and we have to do it. It was the perfect location for our visit to UCF How do we know the room is totally Dander and Flee free for a normal guest to stay in after the doggie visit. Guests can enjoy a range of freshly prepared foods each morning for breakfast as well as a cup of tea or coffee. I was just an overnight guest, so the suite wasn't important to me. Front desk simply said engineering will look at the room next week. But quiet location and near restaurants walking distance if you want. Guests can also find Brighthouse Networks Stadium in the surrounding area. It was fine for one night because it was close to our destination the next morning. I forgot a jacket on the closet l, not only it disappeared but also they didn't answer my calls and didn't follow up in the matter. The living area provides guests with a seating area with a flat screen TV and a dining table. Great price on a well run hotel that is surrounded by more expensive hotels. The on-site market offers light snacks, frozen meals and a selection of drinks.
I would recommend to everyone and only stay here should I teturn Great staff , room well appointed and upgraded at reasonable cost Early check in after a flight from Australia was really appreciated  Look forward to staying on my next visit It is an exclusive business address offering the very latest facilities and a stylish hotel for city slickers in a charming world port where international trends and Hanseatic traditions meet. Well for starters the hotel was in walking distance to most attractions city centre fish market  is not to be missed even if it’s a early start on a Sunday morning back to the hotel the staff were excellent rooms clean spacious and the breakfast if a little expensive at €25 was the best breakfast I’ve ever had so worth a one off The relaxed and elegant 4-star Lindner Hotel Am Michel is situated close to the celebrated St. Michaelis Church (colloquial “Der Michel”), the lively HafenCity, the famous old warehouse district the Speicherstadt and the impressive St. Pauli jetties. World Port - where trends and tradition meet  A fantastic location in Hamburg - the gateway to the world. Very good four star hotel with excellent fitness and wellness as a pleasant surprise. It was a birthday trip & the hotel made it a perfect experience. Very pleasant hotel, good facilities, clean and comfortable and onl6 a 10 min walk to busy restaurants. Only challenge is check in which I felt to be impersonal and pushed towards using a machine
The setting of the hotel is very nice even though close to Sam Houston Tollway, it is about 2 blooks away so the highway is not noticeable. This hotel is 8.7 miles from the FUNPLEX Amusement Park, 9.4 miles from The Galleria, and 15 miles from The Houston Zoo. The rooms and the living room between them were clean and well furnished. We had a 2 bedroom suite for 3 adults and 2kids and it was perfect. Always meets and exceeds expectations .The indoors swimming pool and breakfast are a big plus ! Booked with expedia for 2 beds and sofa bed for $189 , show up the  gentleman front desk and me to wait about 10 minutes before give me a keys, he told me they don't have any 2 queen beds, we end up with king and sofa bed with 6 people's. Rooms features air conditioning, ironing facilities, a hairdryer, an MP3 dock, and premium bedding, as well. The front desk attendant immediately grabbed me a stack of towels and a bottle of germ x & I was so appreciative. Big 2 bed 2 bath room clean and comfortable... pool did have way to much chlorine in it... but over all great stay It was what you would expect, nothing more and nothing less. It is currently beginning a renovation process because the hotel is beginning to need updating. The pool area was out ab and it felt like a sauna in there I was there because I was having my 7 year old birthday party and it was a pool party and he really couldn't enjoy the pool he did enjoy his party because nobody can stay in the pool long because it was so hot NOT TOO GOOD THIS TIME, HOUSE KEEPING WAS VERY POOR AND SLOW. The breakfast was great, everything was very clean & nice, and we'd love to come back next year. Amenities at this hotel include an indoor swimming pool, a fitness centre, a business centre, coin laundry machines, free parking, and complimentary Wi-Fi. We checked in late & my toddler started vomiting in the car while my husband was checking in. We typically choose a condo or house bc we need a good setup with actual bedrooms. The hotel is conveniently located, very close to the Sam Houston Tollway which I used everyday. I got him out and ran inside to ask for help. I paid $189, not happy at all, will not recommend. The Homewood Suites by Hilton Houston/Westchase hotel is conveniently located on the outskirts of downtown Houston on the Sam Houston Tollway, in between Interstate 10 and Interstate 69 and with easy access to all parts of the city. Enjoyed evething but the pool it was dirty and things were a mess. Close to a major road, Wertheimer, but again very quiet. In two years, the hotel will be brand new and really a great place to stay. I book a room with 2 queen beds + 1 sofa bed end up with a king, the room small. Me and my friend end up sleep on the floor. So we felt that upon rescheduling our visit to this weekend in January, we had to actually stay at this hotel as good karma retribution. it was great I love staying here always wonderful staff!!!!!! The toll road made it quick, but had to remember $1.25. Dining options around the Homewood Suites by Hilton Houston/Westchase hotel include Senor Juan, Taco Bell, and Pradaria Steaks & Churrascaria. The hotel staff was friendly, close to familiar stores and restaurants, clean and felt like home! I was pleasantly surprised to find space like this in a hotel. First of all, I need to point out that we were supposed to visit Houston the weekend of Hurricane Harvey and the hotel staff was super nice and they let us cancel for free. Each room at this hotel comes with a full kitchen, cable television channels, a sofa bed, and a dining table. WE HAD A BETTER EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR AND WE BELIEVE THIS CAN BE BETTER Everything was great just missed breakfast lol but will be back again :) Breakfast spread  Overall, I'd recommend if you want a long stay near the Westchase area in Houston. There is also a basketball court, a news stand, and a safety deposit box at the hotel. I stayed at this property between November and December 2017.  Review Summary: Positives: 1. I have small children so I'm greatful the pool was on the inside. I was pleasantly surprised to find that a light dinner was offered in affition to breakfast.
They upgraded us to a suite in a sister hotel. But we made the reservation to be in a very specific place and did not enjoy being driven to a supposedly better hotel 20 minutes away by taxi. Steps from the Friedrichstrasse shopping district and the Berlin Wall Memorial, the H+ Hotel Berlin Mitte offers modern, family friendly accommodations and indoor parking. The next morning we had fun carrying suitcases down from the upgraded room on the fourth floor. We liked the stay  in  the hotel everything was great A fitness centre, sauna, and laundry services are also available on site. At least we did not have to carry them up when we arrived. Selly the barman is a natural and clearly loves his job. the only night we stayed there) the only elevator in the hotel had the sign -- the elevator is out of order, thank you for your understanding. Other nearby cultural attractions include Alexanderplatz, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, and the Reichstag Building. Neither did we enjoy wasting time going back in the morning. The Brandenburg Gate is within a 20-minute walk, while the Natural History Museum is just five minutes away on foot. Rooms were clean and what was needed for a week long business trip. Hotel staff could be more forthcoming with help on subways and trams. The Nostalgie Bar and Lounge is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. My wife and I had a wonderful stay in H+Berlin. With the Naturkundemuseum Underground Station a few steps away, guests can reach the German capital's many sights quickly and easily. Stefan on reception checked us in with a huge smile that was genuine and heartfelt. As soon as our taxi pulled up to the door, the hotel manager ran out -- please do not leave the taxi, we will take you to a different hotel. The H+ Hotel Berlin Mitte welcomes travellers with a 24-hour front desk and concierge services. I had a great time, the staff were very helpful and polite, the rooms clean, just what we needed. It is in the heart of the city with loads of fantastic things to do. Even before we went I had emailed a couple of requests and Sarah made sure they happened. Lots of touristy activities with some excellent food and drinks. Standard amenities include complimentary high speed Wi-Fi, flat screen televisions with satellite channels, and air-conditioning. They (the sister hotel this time) did not even care to tell the taxi driver where to go, so he initially took us to yet another sister hotel. The supermarket next door was practical thing to have for buying extra needs. The staff were amazing and went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. The explanation -- they ran out of rooms even though we reserved and paid for the room 7 weeks in advance. There is a grocery just next door and a pharmacy across the street. And did I mention that in the evening of the second night (i.e.
Otherwise it is okay, but b/fast was very industrial style and unhealthy. A mundane-looking doorway leads to a stylish, modern, bright hotel with helpful & friendly reception staff & amazingly thorough cleaning staff. C-Hotels The Style Florence is located in the heart of Florence near the Arno River and the Parco delle Cascine in the Santa Maria Novella neighbourhood. Out of four nights, we had to sleep at anight ambiant temperature of 25° Celsius, as you cannot open the window, due to noise caused by car traffic and also the mosquitoes would prohibited any open window at night. Breakfast was included and was actually in the neighbouring sister hotel (although accessible internally). There's a city tax of €9 per person per night, payable on arrival. I 'll definitely return to this hotel for my short getaway trips. On second night, we had inhouse noises caused by piping or plumbing, which lasted all night and repeated itself for a few hours two days later. Also annoying that you had to re-login every few hours. Wifi wasn't working in the room the first day and was sometimes flaky on the other days. Some room rates include breakfast, either in the restaurant located onsite or with a continental breakfast delivery. Located across the main SMN station the rest of Italy is accessible & just a train ride away There are two 'restaurants' - one is quite cramped for breakfast. Food was mainly cold meats, cheese, bread, cereal & yoghurt. Apart from the dodgy wifi & slightly crazy, cramped breakfast, it was very nice! Hot food wasn't very good: overcooked scrambled eggs, cracked boiled eggs, & frankfurters. Kitchette costs money to use- €20 per day + €70 for final cleaning! The hotel is located just next to the Stazione de Firenze Santa Maria Novella and near Context Florence and the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella. Location is brilliant - right next to the train station (we did a day trip to Pisa from there). Nearby eateries include Ristorante Belcore, Trattoria il Contadino, and Trattoria Da Giorgio. The bed was a sofa bed a strange choice as I don't see that many people would use it as a sofa, so why not have a proper bed which would be slightly more comfortable? C-Hotels The Style Florence features 24-hour reception and luggage storage. There is a business centre and business services, as well as concierge services. When it was working, it was slow but adequate for Facebook and browsing but not much good for videos. Meeting rooms are available, as are laundry, dry cleaning, and child care services. Room was a good size, with sleeping area, kitchette, bathroom and a little alcove for the luggage. All accommodations are suites with choices of city views, kitchenettes, or separated sitting areas.
They also provided soft juices and a fruit basket for my birthday and were generally very kind and helpful. The staff at this hotel is always friendly and helpful. One minor issue was the (advertised) soundproofing - it worked well for noise from outside the building, but the neighbour's television was rather loud. Plus I saved money by not needing to take a taxi to the train. You walked out of the main station and there it is. Great location next to train station which is next to the Cologne cathedral. The room was very small, the bed extremely soft (which is not a good thing in my book but I understand others may find it nice) and the wardrobe looked like something from Ikea (it had sliding sheets rather than doors). Excellent service from hotel staff and even provided a complimentary bottle of Prosecco for my birthday. Great place to stay if you want to travel by train between the EU countries cause the hotel is literally a small crosswalk from the station. But... I’m from Canada, so that is to be expected. We were able to travel quickly from here to all of the Christmas markets, the city centre shops, and visit both the cathedral and the Roman Museum all within a two and a half day stay. Very annoying especially when you've been at the carnival all day till late, the hotel isn't worth it's price tag other than it's just so easy to find if your arriving by train it couldn't be easier The bathroom was clean, but the toilet paper holder was very lose and the paper roll kept falling on the floor. Very soft beds and cheap pillows for the 145 double room. Bathroom was modern and warm but the actual room seemed a bit dated. I did asked the receptionist to send someone to fix it but to no avail. .. we've been married for a long time.. but not THAT long :-) Generally, the room could do with a bit more light. She kept asking me when I would be done with the computer so that she could get back in there. Close to the train station and an easy walk to the old town and the river front. The business center was continually occupied by a woman who lives in the neighborhood who just couldn't resist the opportunity to use the internet because she didn't have that at home. The hotel's comfortable beds ensure a good night's sleep and tempt every guest to have a lie-in. The location is great, right next to the train station so easy access to everywhere. Room was very hot and pillows not so good though. we were upgraded to a suite with a view of the cathedral at no extra cost and the staff was so friendly and helpful to us. However, the staff provided excellent service - catered to all our needs and more. As I said already, because of the room, the service and the price I don't consider it a 4 stars hotel. Our stay was brief and the hotel is immediately across from the train station. All rooms are equipped with a desk, telephone, flatscreen TV and a safe deposit box. Although the room was small it had everything I needed including free bottled water and even a coffee maker. The Wyndham Köln is located at the heart of the city, across from the Cathedral and central railway station. Could not be better for access to the city and attractions. I would stay there again but request for different rooms. The hotel was comfortable enough, but definitely not a 4 star. I would definitely use it again for the price, there's nothing wrong with it at all - just remember you get what you pay for. The free WiFi Internet connection in the rooms keeps you in touch with your colleagues, friends and family at any time of the day or night. We had limited contact with the hotel staff (we ate when we were out and about), but they were very good and helpful, and all had a good command of English. The tab was lose too, not actually broken but still not what I would expect from a 4 stars hotel. The staff were friendly and answered any questions i had. We travelled by rail on the S bahn from the airport and found that to be a quick, cheap and convenient form of transfer. nice hotel very local idea situation, however it would have been nice to have tea/coffee facilities in the room beds very hard nice size room It offered a great view of the Dom but the beds were two singles put together and kept seperating to form a gap in the middle. Cologne, the fascinating Rhine metropolis, extensive shopping miles, with a picturesque historic district- all within just a few minutes' walking distance. The front desk allowed me to store my luggage after check out. It's a good base hotel, nothing more and the price reflected that. We got twin beds and they were placed vertically next to each other instead of side by side which were ok as well. It has become my favorite place to stay in Cologne because of this. The hotel itself is fine, I would say more a 2/3* but we didn't really spend long enough in there to be bothered by it. It's not a luxury hotel, just a place to sleep in between getting out and about in Cologne. walk across the courtyard when arriving in Colgne by train to this great property. In summer you can enjoy the view from the hotel terrace at the heart of Cologne while the city's night life pulsates outside. The shower head was pointing to one side and it was not possible to adjust it. Enjoyed this hotel close to the main train station and many of the major sights of Cologne. Room was very small and bring on floor one was easy to hear street noise. Extremely small size  (it's same as a River ship cabin). The facilities were exactly as advertised and we felt very comfortable. The staff was very kind and helpful and helped us in a lot of things. The hotel rooms are ideal for business travellers and visitors planning a short trip to Cologne. We arrived well before check-in time hoping to be able to deposit our suitcase, but we were immediately given a room. For example, our return flight required leaving the hotel by 0430, walking about 100 metres to the station, waiting 5 minutes before our train arrived and being at the airport rail station by 0455. A free bottle of mineral water is on hand as refreshment. My room looking at the Cathedral was worth every penny. The hotel couldn't be in a better position when it comes to finding it as it's right outside the doors of the train station and in walking distance of all the major attractions but for it's price tag it's a bit worn the rooms don't exactly look as nice as they do in it's photos as I've said it's very worn also the house cleaner came around at 8.45am every morning no matter if we had the tag on the door or not? A kettle and a selection of teas, coffees provide you a relaxed start to the morning at the Wyndham Köln. Relax with a cool Kölsch beer or a sparkling cocktail in the hotel bar "Le Perron" or on the terrace. The room itself is super clean and modern but with two twin beds? Location excellent for arriving and travelling on by train and for visiting museums. The Staff’s hospitality was not as nice as I would have liked. The staff was wonderfully nice, spoke English willingly and the room price was reasonable.
At first I though maybe he has smhad a bad day but as I saw the next couple approach the desk (who were white) his attitude changed, he smiled said hello and told them the wifi password and informed them of breakfast times. The Hotel shower knobs kept falling off, the staff kept the room very hot and unbearable to sleep in. The room was at least 35 degrees and one tiny window! I stayed for one night at this hotel, it is advertised as free parking but in reality it has 4 parking spaces but they provided parking at another hotel a few minutes drive away ( I'm guessing a sister hotel ) it took about 5 minutes walking back. There were stains on the cushions and no toiletries in the bathroom. What a disaster - its a shame - as they all the ingredients for a decent place - but the owners obviously have no idea about hotels. Lovely friendly staff, very noisy inconsiderate people staying within the hotel, a woman and man having a heated argument swearing and shouting seemingly right out side my door at around 1am. The room was very hot and even with window open it didn't cool down. All rooms include TV and tea and coffee-making facilities in addition to other basic amenities. Small room, smelling bedding,  No toiletries other than soap bar, block shower drain. I would say avoid this if you actually need to sleep The customer  service was not good  at all. Managed to get free parking for 2 days which is was a bonus. I said no and he wasn't happy and tried to get me to pay s deposit . Only offered to move to another room of same type. I must say my experience of this hotel is very shocking. Good, would stay again very clean and quiet close to train station safe !!!!!!!!!! I must say the management should visit the hotels near them and see how they manage the breakfast and what verities they provide. The room is nice n clean,  but the receptionist try to over charge me. Breakfast was a buffet just as I like it because it reduces waiting around time. I love to hear how seriously they have taken my comments and how they have improved the situation instead of standard reply. We were given plastic knifes in place of spoons re: to stir the coffees. The room was clean with wonky bedside shelves and not the best paintwork, the bathroom was clean but it did have peeling paint on the ceiling I presume form the shower steam. Check in was slow ,.... Whilst walking back to the hotel after parking my car I lost the key as the key ring was broken , the hotel acknowledged the key ring was broken but still wanted to charge me £10 for the key ,...... Me and my partner were not treated the same at the welcome desk as other visitors checking in who were white. overall a nice very cheap hotel just a bit rough round the edges but for £39 it was a bargain and the bed was comfortable. O rmaybe the smokers in the rooms they didn't bother to investigate? The hotel staff and guest coming to the hotel were loud , the reception in the middle of the hotel and I was unable to sleep because of the noise. Only they were to move me with my 3 year old child to another room of same kind...  No space in toilet to stand properly at sink... half of sink was on toilet seat... We were on the ground floor along fron reception and there was noise on and off fron 1am through til 6am. The other hotel phoned to say the key was there outside my car ...... And could I go back now ...... There are no toiletries - just a bar of soap. Staff very friendly and nothing was too much trouble,   Down side quite a walk from the tube station when you daughter has bought one of everything The hotel is sooo noises the roof squeak so bad I was so scared I thought it was going to fall on me. Don't believe this is more than a 1 star hotel Westfield shopping centre in Stratford is just a 15 minute drive away. The main issue was the fire alarm going off at 5am - several times, on both mornings - the workers there could not figure it out - perhaps the chef burning the bacon each morning had something to do with it? Explained everything to management, no one had courtesy from management to call or speak to me on this. The room was small , no fan , no remote for the telly , the bathroom was TINY . There were spider web in room, one corner of toilet, with shower was completely dark as light of that corner was out of order. The guests having breakfast at 6am each morning were a bit rowdy, but you probably woundn't notice unless you were in a room adjacent to the restaurant. The cleansliness of the hotel room was disappointing   The staff we're unhelpful and a bit creepy The hotel also provides discounts for a number of local restaurants for guests wishing to dine in the area. ....... All in all I really did not enjoy my stay , not that they know because no one asked me ....... There are only 3 parking spaces - so you have to park in the street over. All other hotels where I stayed in the past 4 weekend offered us late checkout till 12 without a charge but here they said the checkout time is 11 and I will be charged for late check out. I spend 4 consecutive weekends in the hotels around Rotana Hotel and normally I don’t like writing reviews but on this occasion I thought I should as I read the previous reviews and comments of hotel management and felt that they have a set response format but when I stayed there I don’t felt that management have taken any of the comments seriously. Hotel only has 4 parking spaces so I had to park at its other hotel 2 streets away , the next night there were no spaces there either so had to leave my car parked on a street some way away . I saw the dubious rating, but read some reviews, and it sounded like some people were being fussy, or perhaps expecting too much - as this place is pretty cheap at £50 a night. The bedroom was too small for the bed in room 1. I offered to pay the difference for a better room, but they didn't accept. Our room, smelt of stale cigarette smoke all day and night! Both nights I was woken up several times throughout the night and early hours by people coming and going their rooms laughing , singing , banging doors , no regard for anyone else , both nights their appeared to be parties going on in the rooms either side . Fire alarm went off at 5 in the morning adding to disturbed sleep. The tomatoes and mushrooms where tinned food heated up not ideal and definatly not tasty. The 1st night we were awoken by a couple next door arriving at 3am and partying/arguing until 7.30am. The man at reception was cold towards us and did not make eye contact gave short sharp answers to any of our questions and slammed my Id on the table rather than handing it back to me. He did not inform us with any of this information. Rotanna placed us in the sister hotel  named The Bank ( see above ratings). And no tv remote, the breakfast was ok... my partner is a veggie and there wasn't much option It was 9.30 pm ...... dark and I didn't know the area ..... Guests are welcome to request the use of ironing facilities from the front desk, as well as other amenities. Rotana Hotel is within walking distance of Gants Hill Tube Station, and a short walk from Ilford Rail Station, both of which provide excellent transport links across London. The rooms and hotel overall were very neat, clean, and attractive. There was no air con or ability to open the windows safely, so the room was roasting hot. To be quite honestthe room was cold and radiator  was not working  at all. Rotana Hotel is a basic but comfortable bed and breakfast hotel situated in Greater London’s Ilford, offering good transport links across the city of London. Hotel was nice and the room was nice and clean. Not one smile from any member of staff throughout the whole stay! Rang the reception and basically said that he would sort it and then did absolutely nothing! Breakfast was rank , very cheap sausages and bacon and beans and tomatoes were defiantly of the value brand type . I stayed there for 2 nights and must say that one of the staff was rude. It Llong for them to provide us with blow up heater  and blankets. I am extremely disappointed and angry at the receptionist behaviour and will be taking the matter further. I normally don't bother with writing reviews, but on this occasion I thought I had to - I would love to know how many repeat visitors they get! No parking in the hotel due to lack of spaces. I had 3 year old child, room carpet was wet, socks got soaked, room was so smelly, shower drain got blocked, so dark room. Is noisy all you hear is other people’s conversations there’s no peace and quiet Check in was swift but I was a bit baffled at the request for ID ive never been asked for ID in a hotel before just booking numbers from emails. Parking spaces are limited to 4 outside the hotel or a 2 block walk to an alternative hotel.
Extra pillows are supplied and some rooms enjoy impressive views over the square. I emailed customer service, providing snapshots and links of the lower rates, but they still insisted they weren't able to verify the tariff. Buffet breakfast is served in the dining room and  the immediate area is home to many restaurants, bars and shops. Valencia’s ancient cathedral is a few minutes’ walk away, as is Xativa Metro Station with rail access to the airport. This hotel is extremely convenient for visiting Valencia: the metro goes in from the airport and the hotel is about an 8 minute walk from Xativa station. The bathroom wasn't super clean (spots on the toilet bowl) and TV reception was patchy. We went to Valence to celebrate The Three KIings  celebration and the hotel was very central to see all the parade Perhaps the rooms overlooking the street are much nicer and bigger, but I would definitely avoid the Economy room... Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend if you want a stay in Valencia  Book a superior room I'm usually not a picky traveler, but I don't quite understand the great reviews! Situated in La Plaza del Ayuntamiento in the centre of Valencia, Hostal Hostal Venecia is welcoming and simply furnished with a number of additional, appealing features. In addition, the old town (Ciutat Vella) has even more shopping, dining and tapas outlets to suit all tastes and budgets. Hotels.com itself listed a lower price on their site the day I checked in. I paid 100 USD for a minuscule interior room (no light), which was incredibly underwhelming for the price I paid. As 2 star hotel it is clean close to the city centre Only one person able to stand on the balcony at a time due to air  con unit occupying half the space. Excellent location, clean, tidy and quiet accommodation, ensuite room and very helpful staff. At the Hostal Venecia, rooms are attractively decorated and feature lovely wooden floors. The room was incredibly stuffy and hot, and no water was provided. They are also en-suite with balcony, safe, flat screen television and desk. Staff was very helpful, and front desk was well staffed 24 hours a day This is more of a note for hotels.com: I found two rates that quoted lower fares for my room, for that same night. Reception is available at all times and there is a luggage storage facility. It's worth including breakfast if you're on a bit of a time budget - it saves going out and trying to find somewhere.
The meal was very tasty and Marvin the bartender was friendly and had a great sense about when I wanted to chat and when I wanted to quietly enjoy my meal. Staff gave me refrigerator at no charge and late checkout. We decided to stay one more night in DC and moved to another hotel where the service was EXCELLENT! Upgraded units add kitchenettes, wooden floors, and separate living areas. I had to call Expedia and notify them of this situation and they promptly had this charge removed-go Expedia! The Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which displays 19th-century crafts, is about one mile away. This is fine except glossed over in the intro at the check-in so our friends couldn't figure out why their TV didn't work, and we came home to a hot room because the AC turned off when we left the room and took the key card. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in DC. The room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable. Magali is a staff member who did an amazing job ensuring that my family and I had an positive experience at the Westin Georgetown. The George Washington University is about half a mile away. It's 2017, and the rest of the hotel looks like 2017, so why? There were many factors at work against us however and in no way could hold the hotel responsible for the issue. The hotel staff was very helpful, polite, friendly, and professional. We had a lovely, short stay and loved the ambiance the of the hotel. Well located near restaurants and a large 24hr CVS next door to stock up on snacks as a family often needs to when travelling! I asked for a room close to the emergency exit (personal quirk) and got exactly what I wanted. Had I had the time I'd probably have looked a little harder. We booked two rooms and were told by phone before arrival that we could request the number of beds based on availability once we got there. I would stay again, and thank Westin staff for the positive experience. I had to set up the ironing board in the bathroom because there were no accessible outlets near any area in the bedroom. We will definitely stay again, thanks to your amazing customer service, thank you The same goes for the tray of snacks that they leave out on the counter... both the tray and the fridge have technology in them that sense when an item has been moved. Unfortunately the room walls are literally made of paper so you can here the people next door like if they where in your room....I found that $50 a day for parking is crazy!!! Everything was great, and they even let us check in early. Tub drain stopper didn't work right even after maintenance person fixed it. It put a damper on our experience at the hotel. In addition, the hotel provides convenient access to a porter, concierge services, multilingual personnel, and baggage storage. One surprise...the room is a energy efficient room so nothing works unless your room key card is inserted in a scanner on the wall. The Westin Georgetown offers high-speed Internet access, paid parking, a shuttle service, event space, and laundry services. It is so hard to find good, sincere and meaningful customer service these days, but Magali  optimizes what good customer should be at all times. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you were taking your car, ended up paying $88 for the 2 nights i stayed. Boveda serves Latin American fare and The Caucus Room proffers American steaks. The only complaint is the cost of the valet parking, that was a bit steep The sleek and bright air-conditioned rooms feature floor-to-ceiling windows, flat-screen TVs, safety boxes, coffee brewers, desks, and hypoallergenic bedding. However they wouldn't let me cash a $10 check to tip the bellman. The only problem we encountered was that it was difficult to pull into the hotel. That was a rediculous claim-I mean, was he going to give the other customer the $30? Upon arrival the front desk supervisor informed us we would have to pay $30 to switch one of the  King bed rooms we had booked to two doubles. I decided to check out the tapas bar for dinner, and had a healthy-sized cheese plate and sangria. If there were any negatives it would be the cost to park. If you take something out of the fridge to make room for your food, the fridge might automatically charge you for the item you took out, even if you put it back later. Great size room for a family of 4 (2 adults & 2 tweens). Not used to Washington prices but $8.80 for a draft beer and $13.00 for a mixed drink was a shocker. It is also a good place to do shopping, eating, and traveling. I would recommend and stay again upon a future visit to DC The room was great, but the parking was really pricey $44.00 for one night? The room is a little dated, and strangely there were very few outlets. The fine print says that they could have charged me a restocking fee even if I did not consume the item that I moved in order to make room for my food. We celebrated our 10 year anniversary and wanted a nice place in a neat location, not far from our home in VA. We did not use the amenities, but liked that they were there and well publicized. Private spa-style bathrooms contain roll-in showers, hairdryers, bathtubs, and plush toiletries. He said the charge was because he was going to have to take the room from another customer to give to us. I don't understand why a hotel with such new furnishings would insist on making you pull out the nightstand and dig around for an outlet to charge your phone. It is an amazing place to study around Washington, DC. There are nicer places very close by, and apparently less expensive. Luckily I was not wrongly billed for minibar items that I did not consume, but the fact that the hotel could have charged me if they chose to (because of the fine print) is something that I would want to warn others about. Magali, I want to personally thank you for making our stay extremely comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable. The Westin Georgetown is a high-end, pet-friendly hotel boasting an outdoor seasonal swimming pool, a fitness centre and a delightful courtyard in central Washington D.C. Staff was very friendly and local Starbucks around the corner made my wife a happy camper. We ate at one of their restaurants Caucus, and we lived their food. The room was a bit bit for a Westin property Farragut Square is a brisk ten-minute walk from the hotel. The bathroom was sparkling, and so I indulged in a long, hot bubble bath. It was a very nice hotel located about a mile or so from monuments. The hotel is closed to both GWU campus and Gtown. The staff was helpful and courteous, the room was very nice and comfortable, the location to Georgetown was convenient. The only thing is, I did not realize until reading the fine print that the fridge in the room cannot be used to store your own food.
The faucets are to the side of the raised bowls and you could barely get your hands wet because the faucets are not tall enough or stretch over the bowls. I did not stay, I called my daughter who is a young adult and she had no problems with the free room I gave her. Festiva Frenchmen Orleans boasts a courtyard garden area with BBQ grills, an outdoor pool and hot tub. The couches in the living area had stains on them. First time on Frenchman St and this the place to stay easy ck in, cheap parkin and great beds. It was in a good location, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Festiva Frenchmen Orleans offers condominium-like accommodations in the Marigny area of New Orleans. I will return back to this hotel in the future. It was a  very Friendly, clean and overall great place to stay in a great location down town. Super secure, need to have a code to get in, we didn't use the parking lot but there is parking accessible by the back door and the back street. The rooms are spacious one queen bedroom with walking closet and in the living room you have a folding queen couch. Once you stay here I'm sure you will be back floors in room were dirty (not swept or mopped) but otherwise room was great. I couldn't have been more pleased that my group had a whole condo- including full kitchen and a beautiful bathroom for our weekend stay. Location was a little loud til 3am every morning but thats to be expected. Perfect location right in the middle of the best party street in New Orleans It is located on Freshmen St. which has plenty of live music to enjoy. Rooms are clean and the beddings will give you so much comfort after a long night of walking and indulging in the big easy. Thanks for making my 21st birthday even better with the wonderful hotel condiitons! Great restaurants, bars, and especially music, away from the drunken madness of Bourbon Street, and this hotel is right in the heart of the action. The Condo has all the appliance you will need if you want to cook your own food or just reheat it . You can hear the jazz bands playing right across the street! The tub is a safety issue although it was a big jetted tub, you have to climb up the surrounding area with nothing to hold on to. For added convenience, a self-serve laundry area is open to guests. Biggest disappointment was the furnishings were old and couch was stained. The drain in the shower was very slow and not all of the jets in the jacuzzi worked. Good location to the French Quarter, however on some nights the music from the pubs across the street was pretty loud until the wee hours. Loved the location, loved the hotel, staff was friendly, room was a great size - the only downsize was the size of bathroom and overall cleanliness. Our condo was behind the office so the noise level from the bars and bands was not as bad. Full kitchen if you need to cook in and great space overall. Improvements I would suggest is to put  different faucets in the bathroom sinks. This was my first trip to New Orleans, and I wasn't sure about the location at first. The staff member who checked us in was great and so helpful, think he works night shift there! We had a one bedroom condo and could not have been happier with it! but I would stay here again if I travel to New Orleans again. The rooms feature fully equipped kitchens, patios, a seating area, and flat screen cable TV with a DVD player. If you're looking for a different New Orleans experience, instead of the typical tourist stuff, Frenchman Street is the place. Love it at here fun to sit at balcony to hear music. they lost our reservation and front desk clerk seemed confused as to how to fix the issue. We loved the pool area in the back and the place was secure. Although we didn't leave any mess, housekeeping could have been more thorough with basic once over cleanings. Great location if you're looking to have a good time. A terrific location for what we wanted to experience and do in the French Quarter The room was spacious, great pool area, plenty of parking (for a fee). however, you wont be able to sleep until 5am since you can literally hear everything. The hotel is within a ten-minute walk to the French Quarter. All accommodations are air conditioned and equipped with free Wi-Fi. Just OK. My wife would never keep our house that way. If you're looking to stay within FQ area I'd recommend this quaint place. Three Muses is a popular venue offering light bites and cocktails to live music. Wonderful place, I enjoyed the facility and the location was excellent across the street from all the jazz clubs. If you stay check out dat dog for hot dogs Right in the middle of all the Really good music the New Orleans has to offer. The hotel is within a ten minute walk to Jackson Square and French Market, while New Orleans Jazz Park is a mile away. Location was great opposite local jazz bars and good restaurants around.. We had a two bedroom and the wifi didn't work in our rooms so if we wanted internet we'd have to sit on porch. Loved hanging out on the balcony and watching all the happenings below on Frenchmen St.  Everything is within walking distance. Having rooms at back of hotel allows you to sleep. Close to good restaurant and bar Small but nice pool The two bedrooms was good but a little to dark. Very nice and clean.It has a kitchenette that is especially convenient for families. However, as soon as I walked in and saw how nice it was I was so happy I booked there. Pool and Jacuzzi amazing, Gas grill in the patio if you want to invite friends and just want to prepare your own grilled foods. A lot of music comes from the bars and local street musicians especially Thursday to Saturday night. Having two bedrooms - one bed in one and two beds in the other - was perfect for us and our two teenage girls! Another plus, there is a free water cooler with cups in the lobby which I appreciated because I didn't like the taste of the tap water. Guests can dine at nearby Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro, offering Cajun and Creole dishes or The Ruby Slipper Café, serving American fare. We used the spa several times as we were tired and sore from all the walking we did everyday. Don’t stay on the road side-bars across the street could keep you up late; terrific location to walk to eat, see the sites Outside my bedroom door was the pool and spa area.
We survived but had I known we’d have brought our own water. We asked a girl behind the small bar if we needed to make reservations. With the one exception being the bartender who was not pleased to give us wine glasses for our room or open our wine. Their staffing could smile a bit more and overall give a pleasant atmosphere both face to face and over the phone. Once in the room, I went to wash my hands. The staff was beyond friendly, the food was fantastic, and the rooms were very nice! The elegantly remodelled rooms feature oversized windows, bespoke furniture and king or queen-sized beds. Confused and a a bit offended, I asked, what is that supposed to mean? Also, two lights in the light bar in our bathroom were burned out making it hard to see well enough to apply makeup and such. I threw it away, used the bar soap and went to dinner at The Lady and Sons. We had a late arrival came in at 2:30 in the morning and checked in, Valet attendant was sleeping on the chair in the lobby, the front desk clerk called out his name several times and he would not wake up, she had to walk over to him and tap him a couple times to wake him up to go park our car. After getting to the room and getting settled went to use the bathroom and the left sink fixture for hot water kept coming off, it was placed back on easily for use but that is something they may want to look into getting fixed. We were excited about the indoor pool but it was cold and very dirty. The people who worked at the front desk and the bar were very nice and helpful. Guests staying at B Historic Savannah can enjoy the indoor saltwater pool and fitness centre. The beds were very comfortable and clean as for the rest, no. They cancelled my booking with no hassle and at no charge. We would be inclined to stay at a different hotel if we are ever in Savannah again. It started with the front desk giving us a room that still had guest in it. My husband and I stayed for one night as a stopover on the way to Orlando. We also stayed at the B in Orlando and it was awesome. There was a tiny bit of dried, liquid soap in the bottom of the bottle. Per my card I was charged $150 ( valet was $84 so not unreasonable) but this was charged twice for $300. We wished we had done more traveling around the Savanna area. Only complaint is that everything is quite expensive for what you get and comparitive to surrounding establishments. We had to wait 20 minutes for the bartender when trying to buy a bottle of wine for the room. Courtyard located near ground floor rooms - and got quite noisy in the evening and early morning hours one night during stay. all surrounding restaurants, gas stations, and bridges were shut down. Nice hotel, clean and central to everything..use the parking garage across the street for parking. We called hotel.com and were assured it would be cleared up. He then gave the routine welcome, asked for my i.d, a credit card and mumbled,  Incase you decide to throw a lamp through the window. These people with the exception of Jordan, acted like they could not have cared less if you were taken care of or not. Could not find one on our floor so I went down to the lobby and was told that they do not have vending machines but sell water and soft drinks at the front desk. My conclusion from staying here two nights is that the hotel has pretensions to be a 4-star or better facility. Pool is ok - a little small and it could use lounge chairs. It’s a good place to stay for a quick night, but I wouldn’t recommend beyond that. The hotel, although advertised to have a restraunt did not serve any food. Only downside was credit card ( stay was prepaid before we arrived) for incidentals. My husband walked inside and spoke with the valet, who explained it was much cheaper to park in the garage across the street ($15 vs $28). She almost looked startled that we had asked and said they weren't open that night. Overall we had a nice stay and I would stay here again. and they had accidentally left their cable and taken ours. When we returned to the hotel for the night, we were in search of a vending machine for some bottled water. Friendly staff clean good location rooms were nice parking right across street We had to call down to the front desk to have some delivered. We also noticed that it was leaking- our carpet under the window was soaked in cold water. The valet was helpful one night in suggesting a nearby place to have dinner that was very good. This waitress messed up  the beautiful ambiance of the hotel and other staff because she was not dress for success.Other then that I enjoyed my clean room and helpful staff .Thank you. 10 minute walk to historic district, which is made all the pleasant by Savannah law that allows for your drink to be carried in public! They failed to refill our coffee, cups, shampoo, or soap any of the three days we were there. The supervisor made the off hand comment that we had to have faith and trust that the room would be cleaned. The staff was good at recommending other places to eat. We had a fantastic guide who was funny and informative. I called and explained my mistake and they offered me a room at a reasonable rate. The ice machine did not work and I had to keep bothering the staff for ice when needed. It seemed that the hotel was struggling for our entire stay, however. Room is where I took  away on rating being I was hoping for being a boutique hotel there would be something special about the room. But... the room wasn’t cleaned at all for the three days we stayed. After about a 7 minute wait, unable to find a cart, he never helped us. I made a mistake when booking the room and left off a night that I intended to stay. Lastly, we were running low on toilet paper, the maid service went through, but they didn't replenish the toilet paper. We saw a few bad reviews, and decided to give B the benefit of the doubt. There was a lot to learn from walking around and viewing the area. Don't let this hotel spoil your opinion of this awesome city. After I booked the room, my plans changed and I did not need to stay after all. It is a great location for exploring Savannah plus close to the train museum which s worth seeing. B Historic Savannah is an attractive brick-built boutique hotel located within the historic district of downtown Savannah, Georgia. She went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. They had a restaurant but it was only open in the mornings and service was slow and we were the only ones there. There were no towel racks in the bathroom so we had to hang them over the shower. My wife and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary, and it was simply amazing! When i was there it was under construction that wasnt noted during my time of booking. When we reached the desk, the agent did not immediately greet us but turned to say something to the other agent instead. great customer serv, we had a screaming baby next door and the staff was very helpful in getting us into a different room. Must do the On/off bus first day to see Savannah quickly....Must eat at Zunzis! All in all we had a nice time and did enjoyed ourselves. As soon as we were given our room, we went to the 3rd floor (in the very slow elevator) and found that there was already someone in our room. The hotel itself was very nice, beautifully decorated lobby and room. Suites add living areas containing sleeper sofas and wet bars. The bar downstairs had a very nice bartender but the drinks were very expensive. We repeatedly asked for housekeeper to empty the trash and replace towels. The company reached out to me the same Sunday of check out and said they would complete n investigation and we be contacted within 72 hours from the claims dept. Cool, hip lobby and the rooms were very nice as well. I should also add that I am a neatly groomed, middle aged, professional. Food and Drinks Downstairs are all handmade in house, which was a nice treat. Also, the decor wasn't the over-the-top old South look that many other inns tend to go for. The air conditioner next to our bed was malfunctioning and inconsistent on providing temperature. It also serves craft cocktails and hosts occasional live music. The other agent attempted to cover for him by explaining the fee. The price of motel was close to what the higher price motels cost. The room smelled musty and stains were seen on furniture. The location is at the very edge of the historic district but it is certainly doable. We went to Savannah Coffee Roasters everyday instead, (amazing little place). This is a lovely hotel close to everything in town. I went to the dinning area for breakfast and the waitress that came out to greet me and take my order looked like she rolled out of bed and came to work.I could not order because it made me question who was cooking and did they look like her. The manager and bartender waited and bused tables and did everything they could to make sure everyone was taken care of. No one took any pride in their job (except perhaps the valet attendant). The pros, easy access to public parking across the street, comfortable beds,convenient location easy walk to River Street  The cons, indoor pool wasn't clean very murky water and freezing, no in room guides or information about the amenities or surrounding area. The proximity of the hotel was great walking distance- our longest walk took 15 minutes. We walked in and are checking out the room we find luggage and clothing of an existing guest still in the room. They seemed happy to tell me my reservation was not processed correctly...  Room was great (big bed) but old, stained bathtub/shower left something to be desired. All in all, things seem rather disorganized there, but it has potential to be a nice hotel. The hotel was nice, rooms were clean, staff was very helpful and very friendly. Jordan made our check in and check out process so smooth. And kids were in the gym giving the equipment havoc. Arrived late to a room with a painter's ladder, chipped paint and two dirty towels on the floor. For a city that relies on the tourist industry, this hotel needs some help. Hotels location is not in the heart of Downtown but close enough that if you want to explore different parts of town you can Uber to any of the must see areas for 6 to 7 dollars. Because you can hear every little noise from hallway and outside. Checked out to the hotel at 11:30 and went to go have lunch and did some final sight seeing, before we officially headed home, stoped at the gas station to fill up a car and notice damage to the bumper of my vehicle. We walked everywhere we went, the hotel is pretty close to all the historical parks, so make sure you bring good walking shoes, because there is hardly any parking on streets or even the restaurant, so either walk or find a parking deck you can leave car, they do have lots of hop on hop offs and pedicabs, pedicabs work on tips. Only complaint was that the restaurant was only open for breakfast and food was not very good. Staff was great, very helpful with local issue with tour guides. It’s at a prime location and the decor was very modern but it was very dirty. This process shouldn't take so long, especially with children in tow and no bellboy service. From checking in to getting to our room (third one!) Newer place, got in on a promotion so was not too expensive. Checking out the next morning was quick and easy, the fellow at the front desk was not very friendly. Creature comforts include Keurig coffee makers, mini fridges, large LCD televisions and en-suite bathrooms with free toiletries. Thank goodness the guest themselves were not there at that moment. Valet service was very good, valet was very friendly and assisted in local area search for us. Staff was excellent and helpful from the front desk to the concierge to housekeeping. We had issue with coffee maker and I will say the service was excellent we had a new one in less than 5 minutes. Immediately we let the front desk know of our experience they apologized and gave us a suite instead. The restaurant was hardly every open and for breakfast there was one cook and she was rude. wish the bar stayed open later, it was a sunday and bar was closed at before 9pm We were in an area were we could walk to most places. They skipped housekeeping one of three days that I spent there. There was a thick layer of dust that lined the room. The staff and hotel front desk were so nice and helpful. Garbage was left in room,  Also, the room had black colored carpet that obviously had not been cleaned in quite some time. Pros:  The hotel decor is modern and has an attractive appearance. For the same price I would recommend finding a B&B. But the construction, the physical maintenance, the quality of the furnishing is all 2-star level. The morning of checkout a bill arrived under the door charging my credit card. Neighborhood was ok, near highway ramp but easy 7 min walk to the active part of downtown. Only minor things like the closet door was off the hinge and the light at the bar area in our suite was not working. I always like to give the benefit of the doubt. No hotel info in room, no pen or paper; a 'single' nugget of soap; no shampoo refill. I reached out to the hotel and spoke with the General manager who states their valet is outsourced and would have the valet managment company reach out to me. The heated pool was not heat and did not look cleaned. From the hair ball in the tub to the stench of the drain cleaner to the snooty desk person, we had a terrible experience. This review could not be completed because at this point it changed languages. The hotel is located within a 5 to 15 minute walk to most local attractions. I probably should mention that I am African American and that he is not. Parking was terrible and loud construction noises as well as tons of dust and just overall dirty feeling. I suppose Savannah is an expensive place (by my standards), but my next visit will choose some other hotel in the historic district. I first want to say that Jordan was a blessing. The hotel was amazing and the staff were all very friendly and accommodating! We were left 1 coffee pod and 1 bathroom towel on our second day there. If you are just looking for just a nice hotel close to the river this is a good one. A week went by and no contact so I reached out to them again, just for them to tell me they are not liable. It did clear within 3 days but still reflects against my card's available balance. We had to go back for a 2nd room, and we were given one with a wall behind the window (not the view we were expecting), then finally the third room we were given was the charm. My feet felt sticky so I washed them with white washcloth before putting on shoes, and the bottom of my feet were FILTHY! Common areas so cold that many guests were heard complaining in the restaurant. Kitchen 320, the hip on-site restaurant on the ground floor, serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We ran out of Kleenex and toilet paper and we had to ask for some more. I told her that I didn't have a problem with the fee but that I did have a problem with being expected to through a lamp through the window. And the last morning, we realized the shower curtain had been taken down and a new one was replaced! The hotel staff was kind and offered to re clean the room but there was no helping the cause. We are now back at home and it is still charged to the card....at a lower rate than the hotels.com rate. The hotel needs to invest in a different cleaning staff with higher standards. Our room had multiple lightbulbs out, a toilet that was difficult to flush, a smoke detector that chirped even though we requested the batteries be changed, and a dripping tub. Not worth the money, it was not clean and worn down. When we come back to Savannah, we'll definitely come back again! We loved the location of the B Historic - within walking distance to many restaurants, SCAD buildings, and Forsythe Park. When we pulled up to the valet to check in, the valet guy just looked at us but did not come out which we thought was weird. Breakfast in the attached restaurant felt like it was thrown together. It just felt like with a little bit more effort and thought this would be a great hotel. great location , walking distance to downtown and historic district. Next door to it is the Georgia State Railroad Museum showcasing historic trains and locomotives. When we called to let the front desk know, they said they’d send someone to look at it the following day. We were there during the only snow storm Savannah had. It is are trying to be a high quality boutique hotel but not quite making it. Food pricing was a little high for what you get. So our showers were difficult but we had an early flight to catch and didn't have time to wait. The maid service did not clean my room after I told her yes I would like the service. I'll definitely stay here again when I come back to Savannah. great hotel only downside was tiny 4ft pool and no room service. Hotel first impression was excellent service and lobby on point. When I arrived due to the holiday it was super busy. We ran out of everything and they were stingy about giving us more and always told us there was not enough staff, we had to come get it. After showering I walked around room barefoot while getting ready to go out. We paid almost $400/night because of St Patrick's day, but I was extremely surprised to not have a bellboy and have to wait about 10 mins for valet parking to take our car, and to give it back. We did go out and walk to dinner and shopping, and everything was very convenient. I selected the bottle of hand/body wash, flipped the cap and attempted to squeeze it's content into my hand. The surrounding area brims with antebellum architecture and attractive cobbled streets. Nicely remodeled hotel, but I don't think I will stay there again. Her lack of professionalism killed the kindness of all other staff members. That was not the issue the issue was I had no refrigerator in my room and it was half cleaned with the last person dirty sock. We wanted to treat ourselves to a nice hotel for our honeymoon, and we picked this hotel based off of the pictures and walking proximity to downtown. Also- it wasn’t the end of the world, but our room only received housekeeping service 2/6 nights. The only negative to our room was the loud ac unit. However, I never saw anyone eat there, breakfast, lunch or dinner, the whole time we were there...not sure what was going on. Many of the details that make for easy and comfortable travel were missing and they didn't have a clue. Unfortunately I was booked for less time than requested / needed and ended up scrambling to find another hotel room in the area which I had to book at a different , higher rate . Bed very comfortable and seemed bigger than a king size. The hotel is nice-ish on the inside- it looks like a lot of money was sunk into renovations, but perhaps not upkeep. All in all, I was expecting better service for what we paid, but the room was comfortable. Also very clean, which is to me the most important. We walked the 40 ft to the front desk with our 2 bags on wheels. Found about five minutes' walk away, Savannah Children’s Museum is a great family-friendly attraction featuring outdoor activities like a maze and sensory garden. The food was ok, but the service at some places was not very good. Someone had obviously charged their phone in the room whilst cleaning (or other visit?) The front desk employees were nice and also helpful and informative. Our experience didn’t start great, but it did change for a very good experience. Check-in begins at the curb where the doorman asked my husband to wait so that he could help with our luggage.
I didn't realize it had a mini kitchen in it. Touch of Italy serves breakfast, lunch and dinner while guests can enjoy lunch or afternoon snacks at the Pool Bar and Grill. For what the they charge you would think they could maintain the place. Located 66 blocks up the coast in Ocean City, all rooms in this hotel have ocean-view rooms. For what I paid to stay there I expected more. Loved the pool bar and grill as usual but was surprised that they closed for grill/outdoor bar for the season on Saturday night, not Sunday. Room had a nice view of ocean, disappointed in very unfriendly staff at front desk...not helpful either. Guests can swim at the indoor pool or enjoy some sun at the outdoor pool and also use the two tubs at the Holiday Inn Ocean City. The beds were very comfortable and the suite was very clean. and this was one of the best times spent there. Hotel is old and it shows, beds were comfortable and overall room relatively clean. After our two nights we wanted to sleep in and extend our check out time and the manager graciously extended it by an extra 2 hours. There is a pool bar there and private access to the beach. The vents on the floor every one of them had clumps of hair in them disgusting!!!! Same is true for the hotel overall, except the lobby which looks nicer. Even though you are in Ocean City Maryland, the hotel accommodations and staff makes you feel like you are at a resort. I will definitely stay here on all my OC visits. Even though the hotel is conveniently located near the ocean, it seems to be in a desperate need of cleaning and updating. The view of the beach from my room was wonderful. If you value the beach access and fairly friendly staff then book here, but don't expect updated amenities or a clean/new look or feel to the place. The hotel manger Vlad Paic was very professional, courteous and attentive to the needs of his quest. Our toilet was leaking so they changed our room quickly and compensated us for the issue. Was looking for a quiet off season get away with my wife but the convention at hotel killed that. Everyone who works at the hotel was both kind and accommodating. The week I spent in Ocean City was perfect, because I stayed in the perfect hotel. Also extremely pleased with expedia’s Accommodation, including early check-in and a food voucher. This Holiday Inn meets or exceeds company and industry standards at a very reasonable price. I've stayed here about 4 times and look forward to my next visit. Though the room was clean it was in need of an update. The bathrooms and halls need upgrading.. the bath rooms need lots of cleaning.. Didn't have to ask for extra towels for the third guest in the room. I decided to go on an overnight get away with my mom and chose hotels.com and g it a great deal. I came into my room and sat on the bed. We come here almost every time we come to Ocmd. Service was good, the area is beautiful, and the extra activities are perfect. friendly staff  easy check in and out Room was nice and clean The food inside the hotel was wonderful and will definitely return. The hotel is in a very good location and will stay there again. The only negative at all was the person on the desk at check-in (around 11 PM). The room was clean and comfortable, the view was amazing, and the beach area was more than expected. Won't get into specifics but I will never stay again. Rooms come equipped with a flat-screen TV with cable channels, DVD players, a kitchenette with refrigerator, coffee maker and a private balcony. My room on the other hand was in poor condition. Did not expect it to be as good as we found it to be! If I needed anything, all I needed to do was ask. I called the front office; they came and took care of it. Good for the price but will probably try someplace else next time. Other reviews prepared me for this but I thought the location and beach access still made it worth it. Loved the full kitchen and really loved the beautiful view from out Eastern Oceanfront room. We went for a weekend gate away with my girlfriend and her daughter, we arrived a little after 1am, the staff were very friendly and welcoming, gave us hot chocolate since it was a very cold night, we had a great time , the housekeepers were very nice and friendly as well, the rooms are a little dated but overall they are clean and cozy, the bathroom tubs could be modified for new look. Bags of used linens laying around the corridors.Not what was expected from a Holiday Inn. Lauren and the rest of the staff were very friendly and made our stay flare at. Staff was accommodating; I arrived late but not a problem. The carpet in the hallway and inside the room is filthy and old. Not our first time staying there and will not be our last. Great food, polite, helpful staff and a great view of the ocean from the balcony! Quick and easy beach access, nice staff, but in need of repairs. Room was nice and clean but bed was very soft and killed my back. No big deal...just surprised that they didn't stay open the entire weekend. We enjoyed sitting on our balcony looking at the ocean and relaxing. We had a wonderful stay.upon arrival we were given a bottle of wine. The restaurant is right in the hotel and food is good especially breakfast. She wasn't rude but she wasn't warm and friendly either. The staff was extremely friendly and always gave one year old daughter extra attention. The manger gave me a gift card to the restaurant in the lobby and a cheap bottle of wine. Checked in to a nice lobby, nice looking restaurant and bar. It’s the beach at its best at Holiday Inn Ocean City. The room Was nice, beds were comfortable .. enjoyed our fireplace & dvd player.. Nice view.. Nice pool & hot tubs.. Good restaurant & bar downstairs...I would recommend We were there with another couple and their room was just as bad. The Ocean City Boardwalk is less than ten-minutes away from the hotel by car. The view of the beach is what made the stay amazing. The room as nice and a great view of the ocean.the restaurant/bar was very clean an excellent service and the restaurant was fantastic....we will be back staff was professional and room was a bargain,we will be back Their pool and hot tubs are fantastic and the rooms are so comfy. Our room was very spacious and the beds and pull out sofa were very comfortable. The hotel was nice but the swimming pool area was not to clean. We were met by cheerful and helpful staff at the front desk. Surprisingly good hotel for an end of the season get away. This family-friendly property has a game room and many other amenities designed to entertain the young and young at the heart. There is also a fitness center and tennis courts available plus there are a range of activities scheduled for kids during the summer. Easily accessible with less congestion using the Ocean City Expressway Bridge Rt. Overall room was ok ... was not happy with handicap assessable room did Request nor needed showering was not the best but manageable Old hotel with mold carpet and poor condition on all facility. Booked a King room and received room with 2 double beds. Room service trays with food waste left all over the place including right outside our room door when we checked in after 3 P.M. I had a few issues with the dvd player and toilet and both were fixed within a matter of minutes.
Hotel Hotel Silva is located a few steps away from Musei di Villa Torlonia and is within eight-minutes walk of Bologna metro station which provides direct access to the Colosseo within 15-minutes. A simple buffet breakfast served daily in the bright breakfast room. Guest rooms are equipped with a flat-screen TV, in-room safe, desk, mini-fridge, air conditioning with climate control and complimentary toiletries. The 13 rooms are spread out over four levels and feature traditional decor and wooden furniture. The hotel features an outdoor patio and garden area where breakfast can be taken. The front desk is open 24-hours a day and includes tours and ticket information. Hotel Hotel Silva is set in a charming Art Nouveau style building and offers budget-friendly accommodation in a quiet area.
The included hot breakfast is always nice, and allows me to save money when travelling. The Hampton Inn Atlanta-Cumberland Mall-NW is a 3-star property located on Cumberland Parkway, Atlanta. We'll be staying here again off/on when we have to go back in the area in May. Atlanta city centre is 12 miles away with attractions such as the Martin Luther King Center, the CNN Center, Piedmont Park and Philips Arena, which hosts concerts as well as sporting events. Faucet in bath vanity was poorly installed so that plunger could not be pulled up and sink sealed. The inn serves a complimentary hot breakfast and also offers room service. Arrived around 10 PM and was able to find restaurant opened in area. The hotel is also well lit & of course cameras outside so that's a plus for my vehicle. Very clean, staff were awesome, room was large, great breakfast, nice location We just needed a place to stay for a night while traveling. I've stayed in many different types of hotels so I can deal with crappy wifi being my only con to my stay. Great location to stay at if you are in town to watch the Atlanta Braves! Accommodation suitable for disabled guests is available, and guide dogs are allowed. Hotel was nearby a lot of things including the Cumberland mall, Camicakes (world's best cupcakes!!! However our room was right next to an outside door, vending machines, and elevators. Safety is always a concern when I travel & I definitely feel this hotel is in a safe location. Over all very nice and convenient to many things in Atlanta. Just missed bridge collapse in Atlanta, so I was lucky to be able to get on the move the next morning. We stayed on the back side of the hotel so sometimes you hear people leaving in the mornings because that's the side where parking is but I get up early so no biggy for me. The staff went out of there way to make sure their customers were enjoying there stay. Came back from an outing and noticed bugs still there. We were woken up before 6 am by other guests using the exercise room located next to us...people who don't know how to keep a door from slamming behind them! The breakfast was what you would expect, plenty of room. Ever since my sister has raved to me about the Hampton Inn brand being her hotel of choice I have followed her lead when planning trips. Me and my fiancé enjoyed our stay for Valentine's weekend, the room was great, the staff was wonderful, even the complimentary  breakfast was good. I'm not super picky nor am I the type that'll stay just anywhere so with that being said... Love this place! The business centre offers fax and printing facilities, and meeting space is available for private functions. The bed was comfortable enough but I think it slept hot  I couldn't turn the thermostat below 65 and this menopausal woman gets HOT! When I said something about it the lady said “that is why people request to be away from the elevators”. My only advice is that its about a 20-30 minute drive from downtown Atlanta, so I'd recommend renting a car. The shower has a door instead of curtain - I preferred and the comforter and room appeared clean, nothing wrong and for the price it was a winner. Lots of room to sit and eat, then off to the business that brought me to Atlanta. This hotel was in a great part of Atlanta, close to the new baseball stadium (the whole reason for our trip) and was clean, accessible and the morning food was delicious! It is a great value if you wish to be within walking distance of Cobb Galleria, the baseball stadium and the big mall. Room was very clean, comfy beds & after we left during the day our room was cleaned when we returned. We had a restful night although they could provide pillows with more support. The breakfast was awesome & a little different each morning. Very nice and well kept hotel , near the Braves stadium Some rooms also have a seating area with a sofa bed. Super helpful and friendly staff who went out of their way to be helpful! Pleasant person at the front desk provided us with what we had expected despite the fact that the hotel did not have our reservation on file. I was very pleased with the hotel and the friendliness of the staff and location. The Cobb Galleria Convention Center is less than a mile from the inn. Stayed in rm 216 for two nights then we switched to the ground floor rm 131. I would definitely stay here again or recommend a friend :) Bathroom had mold told reception and returned to room later and it was cleaned. The WiFi is pretty weak but that's really my only complaint. Wifi Internet access is free in all public and private areas, and there is no charge for parking. Guests can make use of the fitness centre as well as the outdoor pool. The free breakfast was definitely one of the best offering I've had in a long time. We had a very pleasant 4 night stay The only issue was that the shower curtain didn't keep the water in as  it was an odd fit for the shower Other than that a very positive experience I really can't say enough good things about this Hamton Inn. working and traveling can be lonely, but plenty of nice people to talk with here There is nothing exceptional about this hotel but the staff was friendly, room was clean and it is very close to the area we wanted to explore. Each & every person we came in contact with there were so friendly & helpful! ), rite aid, and gas station as well as several other restaurants. Another nice thing is the complementary wifi, although I feel as though they have changed their policy with that now that they offer two options. Told staff and they changed the sheet but still no mattress pad to make the bed a little more comfy. Hot drinks are free of charge, and there is a laundry service. Expedia did book 3 people in a room with one bed however the nice hotel staff at the front helped us out. The bed was missing a mattress pad so the sheets slipped off in the night. Their location is very convenient, right next to the mall close to all freeways. Perfect location for out of town ppl who dont know the area. Everything was great until i noticed lots of ants/bugs outside in the hallway. For a relatively new hotel, it had a lot of noise during the night. Very pleasant hotel close to excellent restaurants, shopping and conveniently near major transpotation arteries
Pests, you can't put the air conditioning on high or it'll flood the room. This was after I checked The bed a million times to make sure there was bed bugs. The (cramped) shower was dirty and had visible dark marks all over the floor, and the shower door had marks on it as well. Don't be fooled by the pictures, the room we stayed in looks literally NOTHING like them, because it is a COMPLETELY different apartment in layout, cleanliness, and quality. Correspondence and check-in process is very annoying - the property would not send me the address and unit number in the building I would be staying in until my flight landed. I Did Take Picture In My Camera.. Can Upload Them Now But The Room Was Discusting the Shower Was Brokend No smoke Alarm Dirty Clothes In The Closest ...The Bed In The Livings Room Broken It Was Just The Worst ... The included kitchen unit provides all the necessary appliances for making meals or storing groceries. As a person who likes to have all travel details organized and all my ducks in a row before travel I found this extremely stressful and rude. The pillows on the bed were extremely rough throw pillows that I wouldn't even want on my couch. There was a big orange power cable which ran across the room to power the WiFi (which had a good signal and was the best thing about the room). The room itself was fine, standard apartment, sofa, dining table, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. The studio was in a very dark part of SB and it seemed so unsafe. I thought a studio would be better but boy was I wrong.. everything about this place is wrong I will never book from here or expedia again. He sent an Uber to pick us up and we went to the apartment. When we arrived I realised that it was not the address on our confirmation, it was another 4 streets back, we booked 3 streets from the beach, and now we were further. The Lincoln Road Mall, Miami International Airport, Bayfront Park, and the famous Ocean Drive are reachable by car. The location is great but the checkin was the worst checkin in my life. Location was an 8-10min walk to South Beach, and less than 15min drive to Downtown. The hot water didn't work, and when I called the staff I was told to turn the hot water on in the kitchen and bathroom and it should heat up in 5mins, this was a little annoying having to do this every time. Arrived at the address in the posting and phone a management number as instructed by check-in instruction email. It was 100% bad.. Did not put us in the room we book which was only 3 min walk to the beach.. First of all I did not get what I paid for got to the location was put in the Uber and sent to a different location and forced to spend the night when I get there I have no keys to close the place had to wait an hour and then go back on another Uber pick up the keys come back lock up the place take another Uber to the location for the rest of my party was at where I belong next day three different locations six different Ubers nightmare & still would not common date or refund The Nightmare Night unbelievable very unprofessional There is no parking till 3 blocks away, the room was dirty, small with broken windows and the bed.. omg.. it was broken so it sank on one side simple flat white sheets with 2 flat pillows I was able to sleep 2 hours and me and my husband came back home with back pains! The bed sheets and towels had obviously not been bleached or cleaned properly. When we went inside this apartment building, the corridor was full of bleach smell. If you think this place is too nice for its price, it actually is. I called 3 times, the first 2 were unanswered, went to voice mail, but it was full so I couldn't leave a message. The location is great and the staff is pretty friendly. After waiting 20 minutes a guy came to greet us who seems so sketchy bc he insisted we brought our bags up before we got our keys. When I did call them upon arrival in Miami they didn't answer for around thirty minutes as I sat in the airport calling them over and over. When we called to complain about the room looking NOTHING like the photos advertised (in style, cleanliness, or quality) they told us that the pictures advertised were taken of one room they sell, but not all. I would pass on this if you are looking for all the services that a hotel provides - but for my needs as a single traveler on a budget and looking to cook while on vacation - this worked out well enough. Kitchenette and bathroom not clean, no maintainance and no service (no towels, no bedsheets change, shower curtain moldy, no toilet paper, ) over one full week, very loud in the morning due to dump trucks in the alley. From checking in to everything about this stay was horrible, upon arriving they ask you to call to make sure someone can greet you well I did, And the guy couldn't even slow down so I can write down the address of where they was sending us too. Fyi the place looked NOTHING like the pictures absolutely NOTHING like it This studio apartment is conviniently close to all mayor stores like Victoria secret, dash, Aldo, guess, banana republic and more. Avoid this place at all cost if you want to spare yourself an unpleasant experience. The bathroom is SHARED WITH THE BEDROOM as in one wall of the bedroom is a curtain which supposedly separates the two. It's also a block away from the beach and ocean drive perfect for walking the strip and bars. I did see what appeared to be a cockroach stroll across the kitchen floor one night. Worst place I ever stayed at, they don't suck as much as expedia customer service line though. As we approach the room's door, two cleaning ladies came up and said we had to wait outside when they clean the room. Definitely a great location for all the south beach hot spots. They put us far from the beach was a 19 min walk.... It was very unsettling, but the building itself was dated and extremely humid so I try to be forgiving. The information provided told us to go to a cafe where we would check in, on arrival the cafe staff said this is not a check in spot, rather a representative would meet us here once we called. Elevator stock no one help you , no answer at the emergency number , I sleep in the main hall because elevator was out of service service stairs are locked by code which I don had it  , no water for 2 days it was the worst service ever We called to ask about parking arrangement but phone was not picked up. We were then told to go to a different address from the one listed in this posting with no explanation on why. The bed itself offers no comfort, unless you enjoy the feeling of every single spring and barely any padding. There were dirty marks all over the bedroom walls as well. On checkout, we went to the office, and were able to leave our luggage in storage until we needed to catch our flight. I feel that they can do a little better on the price for what you're getting. If you left a light on at night people outside could clearly see into your room through the glass front door (in an apartment complex... When we arrived at the new address, the place was on a street section that was under construction and we had to park our car a couple street away. We peeked inside and room and saw that it is no where close to similar to the pictures in the posting. Completely rude and unprofessional he actually was not the only person who was rude there was 3 more of them that kept answering the phone. Once I was able to navigate to the property I was very pleased with the location and state of the apartment - it was perfect for my needs as a single traveler, and only a short walk to markets, shops, bars, the beach, practically anything you could need. Hotel management did not warn us about this construction or gave parking instruction prior to arrival. 30 minutes later the cleaning was still not done, so we called/messaged hotel management for a refund to find another place, but no one got back to us. Work and lie to me and say that whole area but everyone else at cable but me...will never book again... All the give u is lies lies and more lies The third time it was answered, the man on the phone asked me to walk 4 blocks to another location for check in, I refused, having all my luggage, and said this should have been outlined in the first place. I only wish that they had included at least an extra blanket for sleeping, as there were only sheets on the bed, which I don't find exceptionally comfortable. We decided to take our loss and went to another hotel near the beach instead. Bath tub was dirty one roll of tissue for 5 days no full length mirror so u can see yourself. There were extra towels and blankets, but the bed was quite uncomfortable. They did try to put me in a space that I really didn't like and I refused and that's when I was  moved to the better location/apartment. Guests can purchase supplies, dine out, or find drinks in the surrounding streets of the district. There was a man there to check us in, this was seamless - leaving his phone number if we needed anything. The pull out couch wasn't any better you can see rips going on all over the couch and bed..
If you want to lounge in the hotel and soak up the vibe, this isnt for you. No microwave or fridge in the room and the tv is small. I would like for them to take the $15 off. Odd little window in the bathroom so close the sliding bathroom door if you dont want wakened by the daylight. I will say remember they do charge resort fees in Vegas. Will definitely Stu there again of I ever get a chance to go back to Vegas One luggage in the trunk, and the other one I had to put in the back seat of the car. Housekeeping in the hallway apologized and immediately when inside to clean it. Many restaurants and coffee shop to chose from for breakfast, lunch and or dinner. my first time I was stay this hotel but I very like it . One problem was there were too many non players lounging around and occupying seats at the race and sports book . I have been in a lot of hotels and I would say that it is just okay. Ice machine was broken had to go to another floor. Ample dining options allow visitors to choose from a range of fresh seafood, prime steaks, spectacular Chinese dishes, or casual fare like barbecue ribs and chips – the choices are endless. All of the staff I encountered were helpful and friendly. Cheep  shuttle will take you to the Orleans and the main strip every half hour ...The casino is not bad and the buffet is good and very affordable if you're looking for a affordable hotel off the strip it's not a bad place to stay... Very good for familes and groups as it is not the largest in Vegas so you can find your group pretty quickly. A non smoking room with handicap access was unavailable so the room was stuffy with stale smoke smell. So when I get to the hotel, I parked on the roof of the garage. Staff at check in, bellman and valet parking were all professional and happy to assist us. And I tell my wife if next trip come to visit Las Vegas asgain I like stay in Gold Cast hotel finally I did stay in here for 3 nights . Construction started right at 6:50am Monday morning, so no sleeping in. You come back at 1:15 after wasting your time and now there is a line. Room was very good, but the smoking in the Casino is always an issue I didn't want to leave my luggage in the car, afraid someone would break in. But hey, I have paid $8 for the same thing elsewhere. Room was awesome and employees were very helpful, friendly and accomadating i love this hotel...always clean, rooms are quiet, the staff, from the cleaning crew to the waitress's, security guard, front desk, everyone i had contact with was pleasant, friendly and helpful. Room service lacked a bit but when we spoke to the manager she was very helpful and gave us credit to our room for meals. Only there from 3pm to 9:00 leaving on red eye at midnight. 8.00 dollar breakfast and 10.00 lunch with lots of chooses. Overall a better experience than I expected for an older establishment. The hotel has a casino and also walking distance to Rio and Palms casino. We won’t visit the buffet ever again but we may be back to the hotel. The bed was ok but the two chairs were not comfortable for long sitting. We stayed two days and nights left a day early on Wednesday March 28th we had seen enough of Vegas and my foot was very swollen from all the walking couldn’t do it anymore!! Housekeeping spoiled us with extra coffee so we could enjoy our mornings. One for my girls who turned 21 and one for me and my husband. The hotel said to contact you because we left a day early so we need reimbursed for Wednesday March 28th we left by 10:00 am!! We decided to stay in an older hotel  it was different in a good way. We thought everything was fine and the central location is great. requested non-smoking room...was told a check, none available... room stunk like an ashtray...   then... internet access... said on the check in screen that it was $0 for 24 hours... got charged $72... will never ever use that hotel again & definitely will not refer it to anyone either..... rumor that they lost one of the big AFTER PARTY because of the same type of crap that I got.... BAD SERVICE!!! It was the first time we stayed on this hotel and everything was ok, except for the buffet it doesn't have a lot of variety of food, for the same price you can get a really better one at The Orleans. Very clean, good breakfast buffett, not super fancy but overall a great clean room, decent food, and a great price. The hotel gave us the deluxe room (which was not comfortable), and refused to give us the room looks like what posted on Orbitz website. The buffet was good and the price was also good. Actual cost of per day stay is room and Resort fees of $$80 !!!! Nothing impressive, stayed because it was reasonable and close to the Star Trek Convention. Besides that, it was a clean and comfortable room, definitely we would stay here again. It is a long walk from parking to lobby even with elevator ( especially with luggage). Excellent access to bathroom for wheelchair but no seat for shower. We were very busy checking out the casino's in the area. There was a whizing sound by the door during the day, although it didn’t bother me too much as I spent most of the time touring, I could have done without that sound. This is great for a cheap bed not far from the action. You can't avoid walking around the casino without smelling the smoke. The casino was huge, we enjoyed the pool, bowling alley and bingo room also. The location was great, the price was great and it had everything we needed. I don't think it fair you have to pay extra. An outdoor heated pool, and a hot tub and spa ensure total relaxation, while a fitness and business centre adds another level of convenience for all. The lady couldn't find my reservation and I had to show her my email confirmation. go to have fun not a lot of traffic  very friendly  and an older crowd if that's what your looking for This is my second stay in the past six months and we so pleasantly surprised at the new remodeled rooms. They simply said picture on Orbitz website does not match what they actually have. She then proceeded to enter the address on my driver's license and didn't even bother to confirm it was correct. Everything is beautiful and I enjoyed being away from downtown with all the crowds and noise. I felt like the front desk punished us for getting a good deal online and gave us the worst room possible. Clean rooms, close to the Strip with good restaurants and dining. Had a clogged shower and it took two calls to get help. Pretty nice view of buildings on the strip and surrounding Casinos (Rio and Palms). The noise from trucks off loading air ducts was so loud we flew out of bed. I also appreciated the choice of restaurants within the hotel. Didn't have time to check out the pool area, but next time ! Have stayed at the Gold Coast in Las Vegas many many times over the past 25 years and have been pleased. Ping Pang Pong was good and busy, service was slow and soups were tasteless. We’ve stayed here many times and this was the worst stay. If the resort fee is MANDATORY why does it have to be paid at check-out? The mattress appeared to have some broken springs in it. Obviously the initial room  cost is very good and the added resort fee is hidden from view until check-out. Very cheap beer but you have to get your timing right - I could never work out why a beer was sometimes $1.25 and sometimes $4.00 for the same bottle. The price is awesome, easy parking, and the location is great! Orbitz must clearly show the actual cost of the room. Cable TV, in-room phones, and paid Wi-Fi is also included. I liked the hotel ,buffet and distance to strip . The staff is very pleasant to deal with and the room was clean. I booked us a deluxe King room and got a rude attitude at the front desk that when you book online you never are guarenteed a King bed. So when I was going to check in, they said it would be a extra $15 for early check in. We ordered the premium room, which is much more expensive when compared with the deluxe room. This was my fifth time staying at the Gold Coast. Got the 1st floor way at the end of the 2 mile long hall. I did not like the door(less) shower, as water got all over the floor when showering. A myriad of facilities and services ensures guests have an excellent variety of activities at their disposal. great staff n property... be the GREATEST if they could guarantee my winning at the crap table The cost of our rooms was clearly stated when we booked. Modern rooms feature work desks and coffee-making facilities for guest convenience, as well as en-suite bathrooms with speciality bath amenities. Very surprised and angry when we HAD to pay an extortionate Resort fee of $20 per day! I was come visit this hotel before but didn’t stay in . With the Las Vegas Strip just two kilometres from Gold Coast Hotel & Casino, and 86 000 square feet of casino space open around the clock, travellers are invited to experience entertainment like never before. Crab legs were on the menu but none were available. The room was not cleaned when we opened the door. The Fremont Experience in downtown Las Vegas, where the entertainment never stops, is about a 15-minute drive from Gold Coast Hotel & Casino. While there was some noise in the evening, I appreciated being close to the Lobby and getting to the conference rooms quickly. The decor is a bit dark and could use a little updating. The hotel staff and rooms were ok although the hotel itself is old and outdated. We didn't sleep hardly at all since the mattress was so uncomfortable. Excellent room and excellent stay overall, only complaint was that our room was not cleaned two of the five days we were there, in the hotels defense however, we did sleep until noon after extensive revelry the nights before. Small amount of rooms and rooms aren't real big, but they are modern, nice and quiet. Good experience the hotel is older but my room was clean and nice. The full length mirror was virtually useless because of a movable closet placed inappropriately for mirror use. We called Orbitz 4 times, every time I called, Orbitz says the hotel's system is down. Parking is super easy and access is good off the interstate. I also did not like the ice chest, cups and coffee maker being in the bathroom on the sink counter. The casino and main floor is a bit dated, but the rooms were very nice. Our room was clean and a nice size with a comfy bed.
The location and friendliness of everyone made the experience a pleasant surprise. The hotel had only enough amenities to be considered as 3-star hotel. Since I was on English time, I woke early and used the desk for a number of hours. Stay was fine...was there asa result of the storm knocking out power to where I was staying... Some of the front desk people we nice, some were very standoffish, borderline rude. This was an overnight stay between a flight arrival from the UK and boarding a cruise ship. I travel 40+ weeks per year for business and this was a personal trip - very disappointed in this location. Restaurant Service is slow, and staff is in need of a lesson on friendliness. Free 24/7 shuttle to the airport, and likely the closest hotel to Terminal A. It was a great experience to drop off the car the night before, have a leisurely lie in, a great breakfast, and then a quick shuttle ride into the airport to head out. Guests may enjoy a complimentary cooked-to-order breakfast, unwind with a drink at the complimentary Evening Reception, or dine in the on-site restaurant, Porter Bar & Grill. THE ONLY PLUS WAS THAT THE AIRPORT SHUTTLE DRIVER WAS VERY, VERY NICE! peeling wallpaper, damaged wallpaper, dirty worn upholstery, dirty carpet, mould around the bath, shower and sink, noisy air-conditioning. The rooms were as expected - although the second room had a peculiar odor - I think maybe new carpeting. Sat at restaurant table 15 minutes, waitress walked by, then a bartender walked by, not even a I'll be right with you, nothing. The hotel was freezing due to problems with the heat that day. Valet attendants and housekeepers were nice and did their best. This is also one of the new format and it makes breakfast real  slow Too many other options in Boston to  deal with this hotel again. Hotel MUST be accessed via the airport roads, can't enter from neighborhood - gates block the way. We ordered room service, and it was quick, but the food wasn't very good. Lots of static in the room though, and no shower pressure at all. One would expect 24 hours service from an airport hotel. PLUS, THE HOTEL WANTED TO CHARGE US $44 FOR PARKING OUR CAR - WHICH WE PICKED UP AT THE AIRPORT - FOR 2.5 HOURS!!! Walked out and got dinner elsewhere after being totally ignored. The only issue we had was with the airport shuttle. We actually stayed two weekends in a row as Boston was the departure/reentry for a European vacation. When I called down to ask for a blanket, someone from housekeeping delivered a crib. The hot food was not particularly hot, but the make-to-order omelets were excellent. the hot tub's water was very cool and not comfortable to go into. Great breakfast great shuttle to airlines Orr and the T.  Highly recommend TV in the bedroom was unplugged and the outlet was behind a very large armoire. When I arrived at the hotel on Saturday, Feb. 10, I was so pleased with the room and its features. shuttle is great, people helpful, breakfast is good, close to some really good restaurants One caveat for those with wheelchairs; while the bathroom is good and the sitting room, it could be tough to manoeuver in the bedroom because of the size of the credenza, a problem which could maybe be solved by removing the doors, but still very little space between the end of the bed and the unit. We stayed the night, had a wonderful free breakfast, hot and cold, everything from pastry to eggs and bacon, great coffee. That said, the buffet breakfast that was included was good, had lots of options and could be improved by going until 10am instead of 9 for those of us coming in jet-lagged. They kept an eye on my renatl car whilst II placed my bags in the room and then made it so easy for me to drop off the car aat the rental car drop off point - right next door  Nice people Embassy Suites by Hilton Boston at Logan Airport features a 24-hour business centre, fitness centre, and an indoor pool with a whirlpool. Hotel store needs to be improved since there is so little in the area. It was a very nice end to a great trip. It is right on the airport, and the hotel shuttles run all night. The room we booked was unavailable, so the hortel gave us 2 priority suites instead. The hotel offers 273 spacious two-room suites with a TV in each room, as well as a well-lit work table, wet bar, refrigerator, microwave, and coffeemaker in the living area. I arrived after that time and could not order anything after a flight of 16 hours. Free breakfast which is good but would like a broader dinner and snack menu since there is Not much to do in area and not much within walking distance. Hotel under renovation Short staffed and much confusion regarding overnight parking. I did not give the hotel a full 5 rating because arriving at 11 PM from my flight I found no food options at the hotel. Then, walked around the park out front to the T station, went downtown and walked the freedom trail, stored our luggage and then picked it up and took the shuttle to the airport for a late overseas flight The New England Aquarium, Paul Revere Mall, and the Wharf are also within four miles. After an international flight it was great to find a hotel that was bright and cheerful with excellent staff. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. Food selection was OK but not as extensive as I would have liked. The staff person at the front desk did provide me with a delivery option from the outside but I would have preferred the option of at least a sandwich and a soda in-house. After repeatedly calling the hotel and being told the shuttle was on its way, it seemed that they had only one shuttle running picking up passengers from all terminals and would get filled before it came to our terminal. Nice suite with plenty of room, coffee maker in the room, two nice, large TVs. From start to finish the staff was helpful and made sure we enjoyed our stay. WE PICKED IT UP, WENT TO CHECK INTO THE HOTEL, AND LEFT ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER...AND THEN RETURNED THE CAR BEFORE GOING BACK TO THE HOTEL. I booked here because my flight was getting in too late to get back to the Cape and it turned out to be a good place to be stormbound once I did a bit of food shopping. The interior of the unit was cut to accommodate the newer TV, leaving a cut edge of particleboard exposed. This is a great hotel and for the proximity to the airport, it is reasonably priced. AC / Heat was a bit flaky, hot tub was ice cold day 1 (which was definitely a disappointment with us calling ahead about this on a last minute booking and being told they had one)... but overall we enjoyed the trip We also needed to call front desk to get a hair dryer (which is odd, since that's usually already there in other hotel rooms). The hotel is right behind the car rental facility for Logan airport which was really nice. Utterly convenient to the airport  (and the Car Rental complex). Well connected by rail, air, and a complimentary 24-hour shuttle, Embassy Suites by Hilton Boston at Logan Airport is an ideal base for a business or vacation trip to its historic city. Tucked away behind what used to be Thrifty Car, the ES is truly a great place to stay when traveling through Logan. Overall, however, the feel was very sterile and the hallways, elevator and lobby are industrial and not well kept. Nice hotel, pool was closed which was a big disappointment for us. Room tv cable was out due to weather, but fixed within a few hours. We were given an accessible room, which was okay for 3 adults. We had to wait for a whole hour to get us picked up from the airport in 10 F weather. Hotel was very enjoyable to stay at, great links to Boston centre and airport. A lobster roll at Faneuil Hall is only three miles away, and a cannoli in Little Italy only four. THE HOTEL STILL HASN'T FOLLOWED UP WITH HER, A DAY AFTER HER DEPARTURE FROM THE HOTEL. I'm not sure why I got a handicapped accessible suite, but it was great to have the tiny fridge and microwave so I could stock up on food rather than shell out exorbitant prices for room service (meal+$5 delivery charge? Breakfast was a huge spread of food, some of it was Luke warm Stayed and had a big rain storm So a lot of people tried to eat there. Hotel was nice beds sagged, unconfortable, shower turn on and off was broken, my son had to turn it on and off for me , mold in shower, hotel staff were very nice, buffett breakfast was good, I know there are renovations, as the room looked a little tired. Free shuttle bus to the airport was so helpful for us. Good price for the convenient location, and the room was clean and comfortable, and staff was friendly. Every employee with whom we came in contact was cheerful, polite, friendly, and helpful. This sort of cheap modification is not what is expected of a Hilton property. THE THIEF LEFT HER COSTUME JEWELRY...DEFINITELY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WAS VALUABLE! I booked a room because I arrived late in Boston from London. We received recommendations for dining both times that proved to be wonderful. The hotel was clean and neat, just what I wanted. The only problem was the bathroom sink was stopped up. Overall, well worth the money, and the location was perfect for our early morning flight. The armoire doors would not stay open unless propped in that position. The guy at the front desk did a great job of putting all of our rooms close together. The room was very comfortable, in fact it was a mini suite with separate living room. I was absolutely impressed with everything about the hotel except for the fact that the posted price for overnight valet parking was $49 and they charged my bank account $74 Other than it served our purpose well of needing a hotel before an early morning flight. The bed was very comfortable and good for getting a good nights sleep. The breakfast buffet included was okay: pretty standard, nothing fancy. SHE WAS ONLY GONE A FEW HOURS FROM THE ROOM. Ask for Calvin, he took care of us at 2am! Great hotel,  close to Boston and T. Highly recommend. Take a cab from airpot then go back and get your rental car in the morning
Unfortunately, unbeknownst to us, they had construction going on and that was not made clear by either comments on the website, Expedia or mgt. No need to fuss with a hotel lobby, elevator and long hallways. The motel style building is perfect for lots of comings and goings. Only issue was construction work inside hotel courtyard with loud power tools started at 7:30 AM on Sunday morning! Not sure when construction will be over, it was a small inconvenience for nice hotel and the a warm and friendly Edric was so helpful! We weren't aware the entire hotel was under retrofitting construction. Fort Mason Cultural Center takes only ten minutes on foot. We had to switch to another facility next day as room smell was so stale and bad that if we unpacked all the clothes  would get that smell. From the start, the front desk clerk (on 11/2 around 3:30 PM) was super helpful and knowledgeable and gave us lots of info about our stay. On a positive note, The staff was nice and the breakfast is free. No pool, loud construction noise and the elevator is broken. It is not the kind of place we would ordinarily choose, since it is quite bare bones. I chose this hotel because of the location - which did not disappoint. $35 fee for parking in an open lot, unguarded, is steep. I would definitely stay there again and I would reccomend to friends! A decent walk to Fisherman's Wharf and the Presidio, but good exercise. This is the hotel they would always recommend to their visiting friends. My car was blocked in at the parking lot when I was leaving in the morning and had to locate a lot attendant to move 2 cars to get out. Yes we are a little bit of a spoiled couple from Vancouver, but this place is charging like any other 4 star hotel close to Union square. Nothing like advertised and they were doing construction which of course is never advised ahead of time, only when one checks in. Rooms were refreshed in a timely manner, breakfast service was tasty and had good variety. When I left the next morning at 6am the same rooms were still not occupied. I had quite a bit of heavy luggage with me and there is no elevator (the ground level is parking) so they upgraded me to a spacious suite for the 'inconvenience. Rooms are decorated in a bright colors and come in a variety of sizes. We love it, is clean, close to amenities and the staff is really nice. The location also was perfect - away from the touristy piers, just between Marina and Cow Hollow, walkable to everywhere and some of the best restaurants where locals gather. We love hotel Del sol - excellent location, clean, fun decor, parking, friendly staff, pool and good vibe. I really enjoyed my stay at this smartly renovated motor lodge. Quite frankly, the perk of this hotel is its proximity to the Marina, where options are limited. The smell of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies hits you as soon as you walk into the office. The Drisco is far and way the best but also very expensive. All feature flat screen televisions, luxury bath products, iPod docking stations and air conditioning. The staff is very friendly and they even carried my luggage upstairs for me! This is an unbelievable value tucked away in the beautiful Cow Hollow/Marina District neighborhoods. Love to had breakfast in the patio next to the pool! I requested a queen when I booked, I also searched free parking. It offers a concierge service, onsite parking and an off-site fitness center. We also stayed at the Laurel Inn and the Drisco in this trip. The room was very sparse and outdated given the cost. We parked for free on the street in front of hotel. The room was bright and lovely and more spacious than I thought, but it did have a bit of stale odor as if a pet may have stayed there, so we bought a plug in air freshener to help. A great choice of eateries serving everything from traditional American food to Italian are within walking distance from the hotel. The hotel has been remodeled wonderfully, with the right amount of retro-chic and modern amenities. The location of the classic motel is perfectly situated in the Marina area where we wanted to be. Even though it was under construction, even the workers would say good morning to us. We did not have a car, so either walked or rented bicycles to get everywhere. But the location is great, and the room is comfortable for our purpose. Upon my arrival I got a 2 double bed room and was told they did not have any queen rooms available, parking was also $30. It was a great find and I would go back. Good value for money, convenient to Chestnut Street shopping and restaurants. This hotel was in an excellent location and very clean very cute hotel :-). Location was great for getting to Fisherman’s Wharf easily, as well as the War Memorial Opera House. We would stay again for sure - hopefully when the pool is open! While it is so close to Union street and Chastnut where all the fun is, please don't take your wife here. This was a last minute lucky find on a very busy weekend in The City. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to friends and family. When we arrived at 11:30, there was no parking nearby, the elevator did not work and construction materials were scattered on the premise. Elevator is also under construction, but the very friendly, ameniable staff offered to carry our luggage up. The breakfast was limited continental with only outdoor seating in the courtyard, but in good weather that is delightful. The host Edric treated us like we were his personal friends that had to come to visit. 4.1 star is on review but it never tells you it's a 2.5 star motel. If you just need a room for a night or two it can be ok, that's why I had to complain to Expedia about advertising this as a Hotel. I enjoyed staying at the hotel, but the experience with Expedia was awful I will NOT use them again. Very friendly and helpful front desk folks and an absolutely perfect location. It has pool that Is rarely getting cleaned and the breakfast is actually a few doughnuts/muffins. We stayed at this hotel for one night as we explored San Fran for the first time. My partner and I had to sleep in separate beds because they lied and could not accomadate my request. It was also raining while we were there and the carpet in the room absorbed the water from the hallway, so a good portion of our room was damp. As I walked through the hotel I noticed at least 5 queen bed rooms not occupied?! I'm so glad we stayed here in this very funky, colorful place! It looks like part of the hotel is still under renovation, and the bathroom was a bit small. Hotel Del Sol Joie de Vivre is a boutique hotel situated within a former motor lodge. Loved San Francisco and hotel in good spot but room facilities are little tired. It's as quaint as the pictures and the staff was marvelous. the check in and check out were very easy and the free breakfast and coffee and tea available all day was great. If you like to run, it's really close to the path along the bay. It was obviously a renovated hotel, but very well done, clean and bright with a helpful, happy staff. We had to carry our luggage up three flights of stairs. The Laurel Inn was a hundred dollars more expensive and much nicer with a lovely bathroom and bigger room. Expedia did not inform us of this before they took our money. Hotel Del Sol Joie de Vivre is pet friendly and features a children’s entertainment program. Union Street shopping area takes 15 minutes to walk to and the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre is just a five-minute drive away. We enjoyed being close to restaurants, bars, and the water. The daily fresh cookies, breakfast and pastries with juice and coffee were quite welcome, the staff always had helpful suggestions and the rooms were clean and adorable. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat, the next time I'm in San Francisco. It's perfect for a visit, with access to lots of restaurants and shopping. The hotel was recommended to me by two different friends who both used to live in San Francisco. The hotel also has a heated outdoor pool (rare in San Francisco). The beds were not that bad but the sheets are scratchy and the pillows hard. It is surrounded by palm trees and features a saltwater pool.
We ordered pasta, it was so over cooked half of the bowl was rock hard. We stayed in a suite which had all of the modern conveniences! The housekeeping and reception staffs were aware of the problems and trying to help us as much as possible...however, the manager wasn't there to deal with the issues and we had not received any official apology from the hotel management. The staff is really professional and few are very friendly. We stayed in a classic room which, as expected based of the square footage noted on the website, was small. The hotel is in a quiet area close to metro and rue de cler. Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and countless cafe's and restaurants. Eventually we requested an additional comforter, folded it multiple times (along with our existing comforter), and slept on top of eight layers of additional softness... which did I help. Beautiful hotel, exceptional staff, located within walking distance to most attractions and a short cab/Uber ride to the rest. But, then again, a noisy ice machine would have ruined the tranquility of the hotel. Le Cinq was in a perfect spot for our first Paris trip. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the room was one of the best that we have stayed in across all of our travels. They did not put us into another room and it seems that the hotel management was trying to ignore the issues by pretending it was not a big deal...We are very disappointed since it is a five star hotel and we did pay quite a lot to the upgraded room. They gave us another order and one third of pasta was hard ( and did not return silverware). Very good located in the 7th Avenue in a quiet street. My wife and I stayed here for several nights as part of an anniversary trip to Paris. However, the concierge booked our taxi which was on time and waiting when needed. I will stay at this hotel every time that I visit Paris in the future. There are cafes/restaurants and some shops in the vicinity but the area was not as busy as say the 1st arrondisement where many tourist attractions are located. There was no ice bucket in the room and we saw no ice machine with which to fill it anyway. Room sizes in Paris are relatively small so don't expect large. We had a fabulous time at the Cinq Codet hotel. There was wine, water, and coffees in the room as well as a minibar. The worst part was the bed, which was very firm, and gave us several nights of bad sleep. Great location, as you can easily walk from here to the Eiffel Tower or across the Seine to the Champs Elysees or Place de la Concorde. The coffee was complimentary but we weren't sure about the rest so left it alone. The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood (at least to this citygirl!). Of course, the rooms could be bigger, but that's the case everywhere in Paris. The bed was really comfortable, awesome rainfall shower and the lighting was also wonderful for setting different moods. Being a person who is wary of hotel beds no matter how many stars a hotel has, I really appreciated the all white bedding. Note:  There were not too many taxis in the immediate vicinity of the hotel so you'll need to book one if you plan to take a taxi to the airport. Pros  - Great location - Friendly staff - Nice modern feel  Cons  - fit and finish is off - I had to repair my own showerhead as it was incorrectly installed. Than you to Kevin and his Team for making my birthday extra special (bottle of wine was superb) There are several very good restaurants close to the hotel, which makes dinner an amazing experience. If you want to be in the heart of everything I don't recommend this location. The food was great, drinks were terrible, and service was even worse. 5min walk to the Eiffel  tower and the area around the hotel is beautiful. The staff is very attentive / they speak English, gave us directions, helped us with dinner reservations - you ask and they assist. The only reason I cannot give five stars in every area is because the room service food was not good at all. Staff assistance excellent, suggesting resterants, cafes, hair salon, maps to city, sold us tickets to D'Orsay so no standing in line, found us taxi, a personal tour guide at a reasonable rate....I could go on. Would walk away in the middle of asking a question and was not interested in answering questions about the menu or a problem we had with our drink. The room was made for one person with a carry on. Shopping and restaurants and a comer store all waking distance. In short, this is a classy high end hotel (at a price). Le Cinq Codet features a 24-hour front desk and lobby, a private gym, open-air spa, hammam and massage services, interior courtyard and patio and complimentary bike hire. The rooms are on the smaller side, but if that is not a concern, this hotel is beautiful. We enjoy it our visit to Paris and the hotel accommodation help us a lot! Myself and my new wife went to Paris for a short break and we could not have stayed in a nicer more friendly hotel. The hotel is a fifteen minute walk to Eiffel Tower, Rodin Museum and the Musee d’Orsay. We came to Paris for Our  late  honeymoon... this hotel made Our stay much more pleasant,  the locations,  the service, the professionality and knowledge of the staff.....it was just great. However, the room was rather small, making it difficult to even find a place to put our bags. The hotel is in a good location, close to the major sites in Paris with some convenient shops nearby. Then the tv didn’t work and they had to reset it. 2min walk to nearest Metro station also which is very easy to get around and understand. If it wasn't for the bed situation, we would stay there again, as the price was very reasonable, but it's just not worth it. One representative in particular, think his last name is Mohammed, he was a real pleasure and very informative. It's perfectly clean, the restaurant is good, and it's very small and quiet. Sorry I had to say this but we were very disappointed, especially after returning late from a day trip to Amsterdam, and being very hungry. It's not as big as a Ritz Carlton, but just as nice, and definitely quieter. Hotel well situated but missing more facilities not enough space room little bit small Staying at Le Cinq Codet was a big part of why of Paris trip was so great. Le Cinq Codet Paris is an elegant boutique hotel occupying a 1930’s-era building in the 7th district of Paris. But overall, it was a very excellent place to stay. Staff was very helpful and everything was taken care of. We had ants invasion to our superior suite during our stay. If you are planning to me more than one person with multiple pieces of luggage, I would strongly recommend upgrading rooms or searching for another hotel. - service incnsistant - we were offered a bottle of champagne for our stay as a thank you but when we called for it nothing was mentioned on file for it. Really enjoyed our break there and staff were so helpful. Go out of their way to guide you and assist you in making your trip hassle-free. However, most of the staff did not understand English too well. Luckily the guy who fixed our TV understood us and was great. Guests of the hotel can enjoy a continental buffet breakfast as well as pancakes and scrambled eggs on demand. All feature en-suite bathrooms, air-conditioning, flat screen TV’s, Nespresso Machines, minibars, iPod docks, Mac mini-computer and free Wi-Fi. Overall I highly rate this hotel and Paris as a whole. The only thing I would suggest is being able to open a window wider than 3”. We were greeted by a welcoming staff and given a tour of the hotel at check-in. Some upgraded rooms feature two-story plans, free-standing tubs, separate living spaces and private terraces. We couldn’t get the WiFi to work, and that was a whole ordeal. Ideal for couples who want to get out and about around the city. A 10 min walk to the Eiffel Tower but has many good restaurants right around the corner - Rue Clar - left out the door. One evening upon our return to the room there was a knock on our door and the staff member kindly informed us that the water was complimentary as well. The rooms are kind of small but that's typical European room in size. You expect these things when traveling in another country, but hope to receive better service when staying at a “5 star hotel.” We were happy we only stayed here one night for the price. For us, the comfort level was reduced by the tiny rooms and the bulky furnishings. The standard room was very clean and quiet and the proximity to transit and the Eiffel Tower made it convienent to access. While traveling for the week of New Years, we stayed here and at two 5 star Hilton properties - one in London and one in Dublin. The hotel is small with modern decor and has a restaurant and small bar on site. We booked a duplex room and could not have had more comfort, The beds are amazing. Very modern and clean hotel and a very good breakfast. The room we were in (2 level loft) was amazing. Our room wasn't large, but is stylishly decorated, clean with a very comfy bed. It was super hot on our visit so we took racialist everywhere. This was a much nicer hotel than either of the Hilton properties. A lounge bar also offers a variety of light snacks and bistro dishes. This has to be our only hotel in Paris from now on! We were exhausted and we just wanted to get into our room.
It is connected to the Florida Mall and only 5 miles from Universal Studios and the Orlando Airport. We primarily chose this hotel for the convenience of it being in the same mall as the Crayola Experience. Everything was clean, perfect, and The best part is that there is a mall behind the hotel. highly RECOMMEND hotel especially location and connection to the mall No real complaints, but amenities are run of the mill, with a huge lobby and no breakfast included. The pool is a decent size but the main plus is the mall attached to the hotel. We're a couple with no children though, so we're not fans of places where wild kids are allowed to run wild by clueless parents. Housekeeping was outside our door at 10pm making a lot of noise, including vacuuming. My children and I stayed in this hotel after spending a day at the Crayola Experience. The Florida Hotel is located next to the Florida Mall and was conveniently located for a shopping trip. always like staying close to the parks when in Orlando,  but this hotel change my mind..  clean, location, nicest,  made my trip a great experience The hotel was very well maintained and the staff was helpful   The location was perfect and there was free self-parking of your car. The staff was amazing, the room was beautiful was a great view from the 10th floor....I just can't say enough! The Florida Hotel is Fine, but not a luxury hotel. All 511 rooms have a refrigerator, 42 inch TV and are tastefully decorated. I truly enjoyed every minute of our stay and will come back again It features a pool, whirlpool, a top notch fitness center, a business center with 16 apple computers, printers and copiers, a restaurant, a bar, Starbucks and 50,000 sqft of meeting space. First room was right next to the elevator and extremely loud. From the moment I checked in until I checked out, it was a perfect stay! That was difficult since we purposely underpacked and planned to do a couple loads to wash our clothes. While it had a direct connection to the mall which was convenient, the hotel is older than what it is portrayed as in the photos online. King bed with barely enough room to fit through to the bathroom between the bed and the TV stand. We had a nice stay at this hotel while attending a concert at the Camping World Stadium. Great transportation option from Kosmos to show .A fun time..Would recommend. very nice and modern room, spacious, restaurant on the first floor - very convenient for early breakfast or late dinner, great interior design. Clean room , but my family can’t not sleep with holtel pillow , pillow is hard , push up my head is high, and have headaches This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in and I've traveled all over the world. Not only it’s accessible to the Florida Mall but the friendliness of the staff and their attention to detail is worth coming back every time. It’s so convenient to the mall and walking distance to restaurants. The Hotel is very clean and nice Near the mall , plenty free parking Great hotel, friendly staff, received a $10 coupon to Starbucks at check-in. Asked to be moved to another room and was moved right away. Attached to the Florida Mall which my kids loved and has a great pool that is big, clean and deep! The hotel itself was large and conveniently located from the airport. I used to live in Orlando so I never needed to stay here. No problems at all here for our family of five. It was a quick drive to the Amway Center/Geico lot where we were able to park and take the free Shuttle to the concert. Would not stay here again, found the rooms to be dated against others I've stayed at. We were attending a conference there so it was very convenient to be able to stay right on site. This is a hotel, and shouldn’t qualify as a resort to charge the fee. Fabulous location - Hotel is in Florida mall and close to attractions and parks. Interesting and convenient location connected to the (massive) Florida Mall. A great way to wrap up our vacation, not far from the airport. Attached to the mall was convenient when there were storms and didn't want to drag the family out shopping. We will stay here again since it was low key and had a decent clientele. Bottom line, the address provided and entered into any GPS does not bring you to the hotel - and try finding a hotel at 1 am when it is raining outside! It was great experience i would do it again the place was awesome seen plenty Great place inside mall if you have kids is a real good place to be at well worth it and prices are always reasonable Didn’t know that this hotel was part of the Florida mall, super friendly staff, rooms very clean bed a little to firm for my taste but over all great experience. In my opinion the hotel was overpriced for what was offered. I've since moved to South Florida and and needed a hotel so I picked this one. Apart from that the room felt clean and was reasonably priced. The room was spotless and the bed was really comfy. I felt deceived,n having read the word luxury in the description. This hotel was the perfect priced hotel.. if your looking for an affordable hotel this is the place. There is a mall attached to the hotel so you don't even have to leave once you are checked in. The Florida Hotel is the top 4 rated hotel in Orlando out of 330 hotels. Otherwise, hotel staff were great and rooms were very comfortable. The only issues is that the room     is a bit dated and in need of upgrading. they will charge you extra 25 for what they call a resort fees, not sure why but it is just a scam It's also joined with the Florida mall which is very convenient. The hotel room was very clean and the staff was very friendly. even calling the # brought me to some central location and the person on the other end of the line did not know how to help me with the civic address, however, did did eventually guide me in. The Florida Mall being connected to the hotel is a huge plus. Love the fact that I could walk wherever I wanted to. Very disappointment with the service charge for swimming pool and gym charge which was never used and end up paying $81  un believable never again This was such an wonderful place to stay,  but the staff was some of the nicest people you could ever encounter. Great location because it's within the mall  Though the mall can be a bit low class/touristy at times, thankfully this wasn't reflected in the hotel. The location makes it very difficult to find when you are from out of town. This is the second time I stay at the Florida Hotel and always enjoy it when I stay. The hotel was a bit more classy/elegant than we expected--which was a good thing. Upon departure, I was charged an additional $20+ as a resort fee, but there were no real resort amenities included in the price other than a pool. We of course had to pay the $25 Resort fee. Although  the hotel was clean and well-maintained, I certainly would not consider it a resort and we will be unlikely to stay here again due to the price. We loved the location the pool was nice staff very very friendly and helpful  but our sheets wore not very clean and the room was outdated The gave us a discount coupon to be used at a Starbucks located close to the lobby.
Loews Hotel 1000, Seattle features an on-site full-service restaurant full-service spa and a golf simulator. They  held our bags before and after checkout time since our flight times didn't line-up with check-in and checkout times. Yes we should of checked the alarm clock was off but considering this is a high end hotel we shouldn’t have too, the staff should of reset the alarm when room was being prepared for the next person’s stay. For the price, I won't stay again due to the golf and spa issues. Question the security of the place at night, told the manager about our experience. The view from our room was horrible, but it was clean, spacious and comfortable. Everything was great and have already recommended to a friend. We stayed 5 nights and were never moved into a room with a view. Free umbrellas to borrow when you went out (nice, as it rained every day we were there, and I forgot to pack some). Definitely not a Loews level hotel, and not worth the $300 a night. My first time to Seattle via the Washington State ferry and this hotel was close, nice and reasonable priced. My wife and I arrived early morning to a recently renovated Hotel 1000. Club chair and ottoman are a good place to recover from the  steep incline of some streets. I was pleased to find out the reviews dealing with staff were all true. Room was great, the only thing that was a bummer is the hotel bar/ restaurant closed at 11 on a Saturday...... I want to let the Hotel 1000 staff know how grateful we were during our stay. Every time we came back after house keeping was there the box of tissues was completely soaked in water. Glass walls in bathroom were dirty, spots on carpet, and room had faint smell of vomit from a previous guest. It was a great night away from the kids and my wife and I thought it was a fantastic room and hotel. They were great and moved us to a king room anyway. Received a complimentary upgrade, service was wonderful and very accommodating, breathtaking views of Seattle. And I will be using this hotel and the future. That early check in allowed us to catch up on much needed sleep, which in turn allowed us to take in a full day and night of downtown Seattle. The spa also closes around 6 or even earlier depending on their schedules, and we missed out on this due to that as well. The hotel and staff were exceptional - going above and beyond to help me when I left my luggage at the hotel. Clean hotel, polite staff, and comfortable room but unfortunately the traffic and street noise outside our window was unbearable. The tv had basic cable only, no free bottled water, room coffee was basic, no mini fridge. I would have missed my flight if they hadn't helped out. which was nice but the waterfall shower wasn't good and I wanted to relax in a tub after my run which irritated me, I was looking for a nice relaxing weekend We paid for a suite with spectacular views, and tubs in the bathrooms, etc. Nice hotel in a great location, within walking distance to all of the tourist spots! It's in a great location for visiting the attractions in the city. While everyone is perfectly nice and good at apologizing, this place is a bit of a mess in my opinion. When we asked about it they said when booking with a third party it's not always guaranteed to be what you booked. I also celebrated my birthday during our stay and when we got back to our room there was a cake and bath salt waiting for me to enjoy. We were greeted with sparkling wine and complimentary upgrade to a deluxe king suite with a water view. Just about all the popular tourist things to do are within walking distance. We didn't manage to get a jacuzzi room but the soaker tub was so amazing I don't have any regrets. I loved the room (was upgraded at check-in), although it’s a bit odd to a have such a big bathroom window facing other buildings. Located at the intersection of 1000 First Avenue and Madison Street, Loews Hotel 1000, Seattle is ideally located just steps from the waterfront along Elliott Bay and is one of the most conveniently centered hotels near Pike Place Market, Seattle Art Museum, the business district, and historic Pioneer Square. They were extremely apologetic but for the money I spent I would expect a lot better standards. I'll be very loyal to this hotel - fantastic customer service! Not worth the exhorbitant prices—For the money, Four Seasons is a better choice. As soon as I walked in I got offered champagne and was helped asap! Just had a bad experience on the phone when trying to contact the spa and reservations ( sounded like they are not as willing to help or in a rush to get rid of you) that’s why I didn’t give them a 5. But our 1 week stay was awesome the location of the hotel is convenient, our room was always clean when we get back. Hotel mini-bar has very sensitive censors and charged us incorrectly for about 10 sodas. The room (which was almost $600 a night) felt like we were staying in a small converted apartment. Also, the room was not as clean as it should be for being so new. Asked to be moved and we’re told the hotel was fully booked. The bathroom had nice lighting and the deep tub was great. We asked for a refrigerator and also a fan (made requests at different times). We had some issues with check in, and it seemed like they were training a lot of new staff at the time, but other than that it was a great experience. Closet space was plentiful and the many USB charging ports came in handy. After driving 3 hours we checked in, went to the room for a nap before exploring and when we got there it was a room with 2 queen beds instead of the king we specifically booked online. At check-in, the staff corrected my two queens to one king and upgraded me to a great suite with a wonderful view. Great bed, clean bathroom with a nice, deep, soaker tub. I like to stay in a place that's nicer than my own home if I have to stay in a hotel--this place fit the bill. We asked for extra pillows and blankets and did not receive them. The rooms are beautiful and I don’t have one complaint about this beautiful spot. The location is perfect and the staff is top notch. We paid the extra money to get a bigger room as we wanted a place to hang out during the day or evening to take a break but in the end we only stayed in the room to sleep and/or get ready to go out again as it felt sort of depressing to be in the room. Everything was excellent; friendly and haelpful staff greeting us with wine champagne, excellent location and fantastic C room. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating too. Voted Travel and Leisure top 500 Hotels in the World Seattle's Best Business Hotel. My husband and I found the bed to be hard. I usually don't write reviews but this has been by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at!! The parking fee was high ($55/night), but the attendants were efficient. However, the virtual golf opens late and closes early - and therefore is useless-we really wanted to do this too - two days in a row it was closed. We got a dark room (on the top floor) with a small window with a view of a boiler. Two negative things to note; 1) Alarm clock in room still had the previous person’s alarm set, which went off at a very early hour. 2) Our room was located near the flag poles on front of the building, which made a large banging noise throughout the night due to the wind waking us up throughout the night. the reason I stayed here was for the tub, I ended up getting no room with a tub since they had none when I checked in, so they gave me some meal comp money. We were just a short way from Pike's Place Market. We knew we couldn't check in until later in the day, but they allowed us to check into our room early.....and it was an upgraded room! The room was one of the quietest, darkest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in - not a lot of LED lights to brighten the room at night. Check out was quick and easy, with no extra fees, no surprises. Very nice hotel that was located perfectly to walk to all the major attractions. Quick and easy ride in from Sea-Tac on the Link as well. Despite the broken privacy curtain, broken door handle, and hard bed—we had a nice say. For a 4.5 star hotel, room felt a bit small, view wasn’t so great, and amenities were lacking. We were upgraded to a Deluxe King City View and it was awesome! Excellent hotel and staff from the check in, valet to the room. The main room was small, dark, and the bathroom was not as advertised. The staff went out of their way and above and beyond to provide my husband and I with a to go goodie bag since we needed to check out prior to breakfast. I was quite disappointed in such a nice place having such awful hours for their fun activities. There was a big curtain between the bedroom and the living space and it just felt very unwelcoming. (Oh, and when you pay $300 a night, you expect not to run out of hot water 5 minutes into your shower). Overall it’s an amazing hotel and love that I can text the concierge. Great modern hotel, close proximity to plenty of great downtown Seattle areas. Called 2x in advance to make sure we had a room with a view. The hotel itself was great, we just had a bump in the booking. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great downtown hotel. Mind you my husband told them that I love coffee when he asked the conceirge for a good dessert place to try around the area so the cake they gave me was a great surprise and the best espresso flavored cake I’ve had. I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel - next time I’m in Seattle I’ll stay here again. The rooms at Loews Hotel 1000, Seattle feature plush linens, large windows, 42 inch flat screen TVs, and a Keurig coffee and tea maker. I have never heard of a spa within a hotel closing early. Loud music, sirens, and cars were frequent until after 2 am. Perfectly located between Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and the Westlake Center (rail access to the Space Needle). This is nice hotel that is close to many Seattle attractions. The hotel is located in a nice area downtown and it's really close to major attractions. There’s a tub in the bathroom that can be open to the room, wasted on us because I was there with my sister. Valet is a must considering the parking situation in the city. The hotel is clean and the staff are nice but we still would not stay here again. The pictures in the site do not reflect the hotel. This hotel is in the perfect location to see much of what downtown Seattle has to offer. We used late night room service and were presently surprised how fast our food had arrived.
The hotel itself has a lovely 'old feel' ambience and the staff are most welcoming. The area is a bit noisy though, but wonderful location near the Old Towne Square. Little hard to find, but walking distance to most attractions. excellent location , good room and clean one , i recommend When I checked out I was informed I could pay with my card only in Korunas, which sounded fine to me according to all the advice I'd read about which currency to use. Everything in this tasteful hotel is of excellent quality; friendly staff, warm spacious room, comfortable bed, excellent buffet breakfast spread in the vaulted dining room (apart from the coffee, but we learnt that Prague is generally not a place for coffee lovers!). Had I known I would have taken cash euros to pay, saving £20. it's location is less than a minute from the old square. The Staff was so accommodating, They sent a car for us last min from the train station, helped us out with tours of the city, provided umbrellas for us to use when it was raining. Love the character of the place and its in the heart of old town. This 14th Century hotel is somewhat faded in style but we found the staff very helpful and efficient and  were pleased with our spacious room which we thought was good value. Overall a memorable holiday...but with one complaint which rather spoiled it at the end. However, the bill was converted from 320 euros to 8320 Korunas, which was 540 Korunas more than the currency exchange rate of the day, in effect a 6.5% surcharge! However the hotel is next to a bar, therefore some noise at night. Quaint little hotel a few steps from the Old Town Square. The hotel is ideally suited to visit most main attractions with a short walk. Plenty to see and do within walking distance but also a surprisingly peaceful location. The hotel quoted the room price in euros - 80 euros a night, 4 nights total 320 euros. Those further away are still accessible by a longer walk which we recommend in Prague to get the feel of this lively city or by bus/tram. Location is very convenient and Service  was very nice. quaint hotel/inn...ideal location...building dates back to the 1300's...excellent service...lovely restaurant...charming decor...would definitely go back But on the top floor there is no elevator, you have to use stair. Hotel Cerny slon is a small hotel in the middle of historical part of Prague, only 50 metres from the Old Town Square. We used the hotel airport pick up service too which was also very efficient. Really good hotel, very central - easy to get to the main sights. Excellent hotel 2 minute walk to Old Town Square - very warm rooms! Lighting in the room could be brighter, but overall a good place to stay. our room was located in the loft area among all the structural wooden beams which gave it a strange but pleasant quirkiness. It is a protected historic building on the UNESCO heritage list. We stayed over New Year (recommended) and had the most wonderful time Reception was great, at check in and throughout the weekend AC would have been nice, but it was ok. Really loved the location!!! Very close to Old Town Square so ideal for sightseeing on foot but in a quiet cul-de-sac so not to much trouble with noise. We liked the atmosphere and would recommend for those who like character hotels. Hotel is located in the middle of the old town. If you have heavy luggage, do not book the top floor. Fabulous place to stay in the heart of Prague old town, an atmospheric 14th century house close by the Tyn church and the lively Old Town Square. I don't know if this is a common practice of Czech hotels...but be warned!
This was perfect for a short stay but was a little further from the city centre than we would have liked. I can find no fault with this Hotel .Breakfast was good service excellent , room comfortable and clean. Don Paco’s location allows for easy access to the various towns of the Costa del Sol. There is free Wi-Fi throughout, and onsite parking is available for an additional daily fee. Don Paco features an outdoor patio area for guests to relax in. Nice clean hotel just across the road from the bus station staff are very helpful and honest lost my gold chain went back to don paco four days later as I was traveling around Spain and the cleaner was after handing it up and they had it behind the counter There are also a whole range of food and drink options nearby. for someone might be that you have to ask for the complimentary toiletry bits (razor, toothbrush, etc) at reception, rather than them being in the bathroom of the room. We were for 7 days in Malaga at the beginning of May. The rooms have good sizes, excellent beds/linen, good size TV, the bathrooms are big and modern. Just the basics for a good breakfast (not a huuuge selection if you’re a non-egg-eating vegetarian like me though!). It is a short walk from the station so is ideal for a transit however, we would be happy to stay for longer in the future. It features an attractive interior courtyard and provides guests with a buffet style breakfast. Comfortable and well-designed, guests can enjoy breakfast from the comfort of their rooms, which are sufficiently soundproofed so as to keep any external noise to a minimum. Short walk (15 mins) to the town centre and port area so really convenient. Don Paco is based just three kilometres from a stunning golf course, and is close to the Malaga Centro, which offers shopping, museums and a number of tapas restaurants. The location is fantastic with the train and bus station a 5 minute walk, Supersol supermarket around the corner, shopping mall and sight seeing only a short walk away. Although there is no restaurant at the hotel, there is a bar where guests can enjoy a few drinks before heading out. Excellent breakfast and amazing value at €5 but the coffee is dire Breakfast is 5 Euro - good value and in a small room so can be busy. Breakfast has egg, bacon, sausage as well as cold meats, cheeses, bread, fruit, yoghurt, cereals and other bits. Overall, recommend for a stay & a cosy small hotel. This hotel is great if you want to be near bus/train stations. The room we stayed in was modern, clean & comfortable. We only stayed one night and did not have breakfast but the room was clean, very spacious and had good facilities. A clean and comfortable hotel ideally situated close to Maria Zambrano railway station. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and our early morning call was spot on time!
The hotel is 3 stars and these are well-deserved but don’t expect more than that. The elegantly decorated rooms are soundproofed and feature a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, free Wi-Fi, minibar, in-room safe and hair dryer. I loved this hotel  it had big bathroom  room was very well decorated, good noise control .Best part was the friendly day time staff Zac was awsesome always smiling and kind.So close to the metro and walk8ng distance to great shops ,Arc de triumph and Eiffel Tower. It also offers free Wi-Fi, a meeting room, concierge services, laundry facility and a 24-hour front desk. Located in the heart of Paris with just a mile away from Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, Hôtel Chambellan Morgane is a modern hotel set in an elegant building with its original mid-1800s façade. Guests may relax with a drink at the hotel’s bar/lounge or may go for a trip around the city. Palais de Chaillot, Grand Palais and Parc Monceau are located within one mile. Avenue des Champs-Élysées and the George V metro station are within a five minute walk from the hotel. Breakfast good value except on Sunday morning when they ran out of bread and had to be asked to get more (receptionist went out to local shop).
If you are looking for the sea, but at the same time you would like a central position for your holidays in Jesolo - to be able to reach easily the Capannina beach and Piazza Mazzini – then our 3 star Hotel Danubio is the place for you. Other than its enviable position, the hotel offers a young atmosphere, a friendly and welcoming staff, comfortable rooms with b&b service and the possibility to have breakfast even until late. The hotel is clean, room was fine, A/C and wifi worked. Good location, get beach setup with your own 'plot' every day. The hotel's restaurant serves great food and guests get 10% off the bill if they use it. Added to the list of services are, the restaurant with pizzeria and free wi-fi inside the hotel: all that you need to give vent to your wish to enjoy yourself and relax, you find this at Jesolo b&b Hotel Danubio. The Hotel Danubio is a 3 star hotel in Jesolo with b&b service, convenient to the centre of the Lido and its mundane life: the hotel you were looking for for your young and dynamic holidays! What is better than a central b&b hotel in Jesolo, perfectly lodged among the streets of entertainment on one side and the beach that never sleeps, on the other? The hotel is old fashioned, need of some investment  to approve the decor etc but is perfectly adequate.
I popped out to the local shop and got coffee and pastries for 2 for €12 total. Everything is very petit, even the lift which only fits 2 regular adults with 2 carry-on luggages. Also, be aware- your do not disturb sign does not keep them out. The 3-star Hotel Best Western Le Jardin De Cluny is located on a quiet street of the Latin Quarter of Paris, between Notre-Dame and Sorbonne University. A lovely and welcoming hotel with outstanding front desk staff - room was clean, comfortable and modern. Great 2 day stay, so much to do - such little time. For your comfort, the hotel chose to be 100% non-smoking and eco-friendly certified since 2008, for higher standards of both services and environmental quality. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to other travellers.The hotel was also environmentally friendly, so taking care of our world...excellent ! The staff on reception were excellent and were really helpful in providing bus and metro routes to get around. I would definitely book here again on my next stay. We had a junior suite - room 602 - which gave us a bit of extra room plus it’s in the eaves so you can look out across the roofs. They all can speak English, and several staff members speak German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Italian. Disappointed d that we could not get air conditioning operating effectively and we did not receive our deposit for the electricity adapter Thankfully I still had my cash and passport, so all in all it was only a minor setback. Hotel is in a convenient location but the rooms are extremely small and for some reason the toilet is in a separate section of the room, not on the bathroom. I don’t normally place reviews but I would recommend this hotel without reservation. This perfect location offers the easiest access to major monuments of Paris. This hotel is convenient to Notre Dame, the Cluny Museum, Ile Saint-Louis and much more. They maid still went into our room while we were gone to make our bed... this was an issue. We have been to this hotel a number of times and always had a good experience. The  jr suite had lots of room for 3 adults with the pullout couch in its own area. Had a great long weekend in Paris despite the cold weather. Quaint hotel, a gem and the entire hotel staff off the chart. Hotel ideally located, only 2 mins from Notre Dame and many restaurants. She helped me make the necessary phone calls to cancel my credit cards. We open them during the night and room become cool and fresh which makes one sleep well. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights (part of the 30th Anniversary Gift from our sons). Our trip was to celebrate our silver wedding, the hotel upgraded us at no extra cost which was a fabulous touch and made the trip extra special. My friends and I spent the week in Paris and chose this hotel due to its fairly central location in a pretty decent area. Andrea in particular helped me considerably on the day I'd checked in after having had my wallet stolen on the Metro. Staff at hotel extremely pleasant and helpful..nothing was too much trouble. Our room overlooked the street but it was really quiet at night and not busy at all. If we travel to Paris again we will stay elsewhere. We originally booked for two people which would've been okay but then had a friend join us the last few weeks before our trip and the hotel was already paid for. Staff will be pleased to help you enjoy the charms of Paris, and to make your stay an unforgettable experience. The breakfast had a nice selection and there were a wide variety  of restaurants close by. Got an upgrade to the Jr suite, nice room with a good view of Notre Damme but had some repair issues that they claimed to be taking care of (notified them after departure) However, the rooms were small and so were the halls and elevators. Love the proximity to Note Dame cathedral and other attractions in Paris. The room itself is small by Amereican standards, but was clean and comfortable. I greatly enjoyed my stay in Paris, and at this hotel, and would recommend it to others without hesitation. Great hotel, safe area, clean, excellent service and client attention Room was very clean, staff was very friendly & helpful. The towel warmer in the bathroom is a nice luxury. Location of hotel is close to metro stations, 5 minute walk from Notre Dame They asked the customers to leave the room key at the desk before they go out, which I think it is very safe. If the room was cheaper it would've been worth it. The hotel ( Jardin de Cluny) was superb, it is in a great location very close to the Notre Dame Cathedral  and close to lots of eating out places. It's only a few short blocks from Notre Dame and reasonable walking distance to most everything else. We had the elevator shaft in our room but as we were on the top floor we never bothered by it. the lobby was nice & modern, staff friendly and efficient  Room was small, dated, basic & the bed was very uncomfortable unfortunately. The room has 1 window and so does the bathroom. I knew staying in Europe that we would be in small rooms but our room was surprisingly small. Close to the Metro and RER so it was easy to get to anywhere we wanted to go. It’s only a 5 min walk to Notre Dame and there are lots of bars and restaurants in the area too. Only downside, as is usual with hotels, the breakfast at €17 each is too expensive. We travelled on the RER directly from CDG airport to Luxembourg station, 10 mins walk to the hotel. The location of this hotel was perfect, as it was just a few blocks away from several major streets.
Just a little awkward to get to the restroom from the pool area. Being at home on bedrest for a week took it's toll on me and I was ready to slowly get my legs back. I told the front desk and I didn't smell it again. Hilton Atlanta Perimeter Suites is nestled within the business district of Atlanta. I feel like the bathroom could have been a little more cleaner.. besides that it was very nice.. This accommodation is located within a mile of Perimeter Mall, under a mile and a half away from the American Intercontinental University, and just over two miles away from Heritage Sandy Springs. Special recognition to Charlie and Lucille, they were Awesome and  showed great hospitality. I was up the next morning at 4;30 am and eagerly waiting for breakfast. I was not awarded my Hilton honors points so unhappy about that. Close to the shopping and restaurants in the Sandy Springs area, and also not too far from Buckhead. He could have told me they were not open and send me away BUT DID NOT. Was he first time going to Atlanta and this hotel was great. One of the only two elevators was broken the whole weekend. It got up to 80 before I turned it off. The screen was missing off the window and the door latch was broken. This was one of the friendliest hotel staffs I have ever encountered...everyone was very pleasant and helpful...I give this place a thumbs up! This hotel was very clean and the king suite was very comfortable. The most annoying thing was the thermostat was broken and the room was heating up uncontrolably even with just the fan on. Also there was a guy at the front desk that said the hotel doesn't offer room service. OH what a different world this would be if there were more young men like Guy. This hotel is also within close proximity of numerous large companies and major Interstates. The rooms are clean and updated but need some basic maintenace. I assumed it was only him, well, no...just PLEASE give a refresher Customer Service training for front desk staff and it will be fine. The only complain I have about our room is when we got back from breakfast our room smelled very very strong of marijuana smoke. The room doors is the only complaint is have, they slam very hard. Each of the spacious, contemporary suites boasts a living room with comfortable seating, kitchenettes with refrigerators and microwaves, and private en-suite bathrooms. from the first phone call to the hotel regarding early checkin Alison was very professional and courteous. The only thing I wish was better are the prices for the food however, there are several restaurants near. My stay at the Hilton was nothing less then great! Location was great, hotel staff were very professional and courteous. Dirty linen, bathroom, leaky tub, dirty microwave and kitchen area. I would recommend this location as it is close to drug store and restaurants. This experience didn't have any positives, except the Grub Hub delivery. The room was very spacious (2 doubles w/ a sofa bed) & the six of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Excellent location with local restaurants and shopping within 5 minutes. Elevators shut down on me an my daughters  We had to walk the steps Also, I have a charge on my credit card that I am still trying to figure out. It was a great stay, not to far from downtown and quite. Easy to get to highway and about 20 minutes from downtown with no traffic. Check-in was quick, even though the guy tried to charge me again for a room that I had already paid for online. It was so cold and we were unable to get the heater functioning properly in the Air Bnb and we needed to make a last minute change into a hotel where we could regulate the temperature as it was a cold snap in Atlanta. The rooms were very spacious and we enjoyed being able to spread out and control the heat when it was lower than 20 degrees outside. Overall not too bad and I'd probably stay there again but far from the best place I've stayed. Hotel was perfect everything was very clean, room was a great, in walking distance of restaurants, staff was friendly..... next time I plan a trip it will be at this hotel. OMG...the guy that checked us in was VERY dry to us and even to a couple of young kids that were running coming to exchange a non-working room key for their mom. I wish that they would provide coffee in the lobby in the morning. Reported it to the front desk and the HR manager came to check the room and apologized and made sure we were moved to another suite asap. We were very excited and bounced up to check in desk. Although the staff, at the restaurant, was getting ready to open, a young man went out of his way and gave me coffee. He also made sure that we had comp drinks and some bonus points for the inconvenience. I called the front desk to get a late check out. Breakfast was a bit pricey and wish they had complementary coffee to go. Wi-Fi is also available in the lobby, and guests can protect their belongings in the front-desk safe. The receptionist says yes, you can check out at 1230 pm. My finance and I stayed a night for his birthday and everything was perfect.The Staff was pleasant, room service was great, and most of all the room was like home. The shower was small but overall it was a nice room. Early check in led to breakfast in bed in a great timely manner the whole jacuzzi suite double doors to bedroom and other amenities were wonderful. Very clean remodeled rooms, and the staff was world class. Maintenance came up and said they'd return but never did. The elevators weren’t working that night and the next day but we were able to use the service elevators during checkout. It was very busy at checkout but one of the staff members was very nice and accommodating They didn’t tell us breakfast wasn’t complimentary so we had a bill, but overall good experience. It's in a nice neighborhood the area is very updated and I will return with the kids later Stayed here for a one night getaway with my fiancé. My trip was great despite of being accused of smoking in room. Hubby took me on a small staycation to recharge after unexpected hospital stay. The room was nice, large and very clean also very quiet which is a gold star for me. We found this hotel on Expedia and the rates were reasonable. He could have made me feel inadequate BUT DID NOT. It was to the point where we felt as if we were wrong for choosing the Hilton Suites at Perimeter. the staff were professional Mrs. Allison and Mr. Chris have very beautiful personalities and carried a smile on their faces at all times. At 2 am, the hotel sounded more like a dance club so I couldn't get any sleep. The staff is nice room are very clean will recommend anyone to stay there. My first room stank so badly from smoke that I made an immediate exit and had my room reassigned. The next day when i opened my curtains to let some light in, I noticed there were a lot of stains around the bed and frame. My experience was awesome and I totally would recommend this hotel to friends and families visiting Atlanta. Asid3e from the hair dryer not working we were very pleased with our stay. At around 6:15 am I went downstairs desperately looking for coffee. The staff was great, Desire was definitely helpful and made sure we were taken care of. After check in, I arrived in a room that smelled like weed and was filthy. My son and I stayed for 2 nights following a baseball tournament. We checked in on 3/30/18 between 7 and 8 pm. Hilton Atlanta Perimeter Suites offers the typical hotel amenities, including 24-hour reception, fitness center, and business center. The room made up for the dryness of the front desk clerk. Only real issue is bathroom door handle was broken in the room. Our room was large with a separate seating area and kitchenette. You can tell its and older property that has been updated, porpcorn ceiling and older fixtures. Staff was very welcoming, the bar had great service as well Ones there are rather fluffy looking till your head touches them. The halways are strangely dark; enough that you notice it. The front desk staff was nice but not really helpful. Additionally, we had an issue with some a party down the hall which the staff was quick to resolve. He had coffee, I needed coffee and he made it happen. Being legally handicap it was a painful wait on my feet. There are no on-site dining opportunities at the hotel, though guests can enjoy a breakfast downstairs at the hotel. This will be my last time staying at this hotel.
I’d stay here again but please advise they get booked up pretty quickly. Each room is equipped with a minibar, a safe, and a satellite television. I was alone and my family were staying at a 5 star hotel about 10 mins away (I could not get a room). What I see as a problem is only it is sometimes difficult to find out. The El Corte Inglés Shopping Centre is just 200 metres from the residence. From the outside, I didn't expect it to be so nice. 24 hour staff was really helpful in suggesting places to go and finding me good vegetarian restaurants. Friendly reception staff and most helpful gentleman and lady on duty 24 hours. The check-in process was smooth and the room was spacious and comfy. The front desk is open for 24 hours each day. Dining options outside the hotel include The Great American Disaster, Varanda Restaurant, Restaurante Marisqueira De Santa, Clara Jardim Restaurante, and Buffet Lisboa. They are stylishly adorned using magnificent paintings, trendy furniture, and warm-coloured linens. Balcony door had to be left open and I was eaten alive by very aggressive mosquitoes. The staff is pleasant and helpful, speaks English very well, and the rooms are small but clean and neat. It is on the third floor of a building, and somewhat smallish. From Vila Nova Guesthouse, the Rossio Square is a five-minute drive away. It offers tour & ticket assistance, laundry service, and luggage storage. Was a little noisey but it was a large unit in a small room and did the job. The extra security measures gave the impression of an unsafe neighbourhood. Situated at the centre of Lisbon, the vibrant Vila Nova Guesthouse is only a three-minute walk to the historic Marquês de Pombal Square. All of the 22 rooms have bright and airy atmospheres. This guesthouse is very convenient for sightseeing, shopping, breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything. I was able to walk around the city and explore without having to take a taxi. very good location just a few steps from the metro. You can walk to the city center in  under 10 minutes. The room is very spacious and I enjoyed the location of this guesthouse. Some rooms a bit small but still ok. Staff ok. There is a convenience / grocery store and a bakery very close to the  hotel. There is no breakfast but don’t fret options are near and there’s always uber eats. The hotel was surprisingly nice as the exterior wasn’t too inviting. Only complaint is that in our Double bed room the bathroom was tiny, compared to our friend who was in a single room with a huge bathroom. Easy access and good airconditioner as it was quite hot. Great location and walking distance from the centre of Lisbon. No food in the guest house but bakery alongside does splendid meals at good prices. Best part of the room was the shower fixture that offered e different settings. I caught taxis back and forth to be with my family and have no idead about the area. The hotel is close to the large Marquis De Pombal circle and statue, metro and bus station.
A number of restaurants and cafés can be found in the local area, while good public transport links mean visitors have plenty of other dining options. We stayed in a 2 bed apartment (sleeps 5)...the only slightly negative point is that there was 1 toilet and 1 shower...which could be less for a group of 5. Lovely, spacious apartment in quiet area but close enough to the historic centre to walk to everything. Apartments feature one, two or three bedrooms and include TV with international channels, stereo, air conditioning and Wi-Fi. MH Apartments Central Prague offers serviced apartment accommodation in central Prague. Great decor, and is good for family and group of friends. The receptionist would not allow us to use their WC when picking up our luggage and was rude which spoilt the whole experience for us. It was quiet, secure and had a tram stop outside (no 18). I needed a quiet comfortable place to stay before heading to a conference. The location is great - really quiet and away from the hustle and bustle - yet an easy walk in to the centre or a short tram ride from the door. We had 6 nights at MH  apartments and found our apartment to be very well equipped and comfortable. Kitchens are fitted with cooking facilities, coffee-maker, washer/dryer and dishwasher. No room cleaning service unless you stay for more than 7 days. MH Apartments Central Prague is located two blocks away from the Vltava River and near to the Botanical Gardens. Our apartment had a corner bath with jacuzzi jets, which was very popular with my kids, but a proper shower would have been more convenient. The reception staff were polite and efficient, if not overly friendly (at odds with everyone else we met in Prague). Large apartment over looking courtyard,  nice bathroom, room to move, cooking appliances, washer/dryer very comfortable and a few steps from tram stop that goes right into town and further. Would prefer doors separating sleeping areas though if you have younger children this might not be an issue. A 24-hour reception can be found within the property, while a final cleaning service is offered. The apartment was great apart from the tv that was rubbish too much interference. Great location Quiet residential neighbourhood Directly on tram route 18 and close to Karlovo Namesti metro stop Clean and comfortable Courteous Staff A bit compact with tight circulation space between furniture and a clothes rack instead of a wardrobe. It was only a short walk to another major transport hub which included a metro station, shops and several supermarkets. Very clean apartment with sitting area kitchen with all you need close to old city and attractions short tram ride very safe area train station 10 min walk with good grocery store and cafe Supermarkets nearby and was able to walk to Old Town Square, Charles Bridge etc and enjoy Old Prague. Great location, easy access to tram, metro, grocery, restaurants etc. Apartments feature a fully-equipped kitchen alongside bedroom and living room facilities.
Breakfast the next morning was very good with a most delightful wait staff anticipating my every need. The hotel is in great condition, the staff is very friendly, and it couldn't be in a better area. My stay was wonderful from the time I walked through the door. The hotel was under renovation and the rooms we had had not been updated, but they were good and the service was very good I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends and family. I took him for a birthday trip to see the Atlanta game. This is a great place to stay for a Braves game. Second time staying there and each time the staff are pleasant and informative. The water pooled in the tub for 10-15 mins before it would go down the drain. The tub was not draining well when we took showers. No free breakfast but most of the places I looked at nearby either didn't offer it or were significantly more money. The room was spacious and had tea & coffee service. The gentleman I spoke to said there was nothing he could do about it, so for our entire 2 night stay we did not have a fridge. However, this modern hotel is near tourism attractions, making it appropriate for vacationers too. Overall room needed a real cleaning, not just a quick vacuum in between guests. Rooms at the Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta NW Wildwood have 37-inch LCD flat-screen TVs, plus complimentary Wi-Fi. Room was awesome, clean,  and once I figured out how to operate the heat cozy. Very well located to conference venue that I attended, as well as several good restaurants. This hotel is close to the interstate, but far enough away not to hear it in your room. Very friendly and accommodating staff both at check in and check out. Furthermore, guests can get active in the outdoor pool or the fitness center. Room service was prompt but they would not bring the trays into the room and we had to struggle to get them in and they did not take the dirty dishes back for the whole day which was gross. I like the Wildwood section of Atlanta for its ease of access to nearby Marietta and highways. Only complaint bed had a very well worn indentation which could not be corrected with soft/firm dial technology Refrigerator didn't cool, iron leaked, pillows were uncomfortably flat and breakfast buffet overly rated for cost, no more than free breakfast at other hotels for $10.95 person. Breakfast is available from the Great American Grill, and guests can order cocktails at the Pavilion Lounge. Every other encounter we had with the front desk was just about as productive as the fridge incident. Hotel was conveniently located, clean, comfortable, modern with lots of extras. The pillows were terrible, they were so uncomfortable we actually went out and bought pillows. Loved it will be staying there when I returning to Atlanta The only and I mean only thing I was displeased about was very poor internet service. I've never not had the staff bring it to us, was not the best customer service. When we arrived we noticed our refrigerator was not working and called down to the front desk. The room definitely needs an update and a good cleaning. I loved this hotel and the staff was great and took care of anything that I needed. Wonderful hotel exceptional staff shuttle to Suntrust Park and Cumberland Mall were great amenities. There were roaches in the elevator area and someones hair in the shower. Situated in the Wildwood Business Park, the Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta NW Wildwood is an excellent choice for corporate guests. Nice hotel, nice area, just wish i brought my own pillow We had no problem finding the location and were promptly checked in. The pantry that was available was very pricey, over four dollars  for a bottle of iced tea. Outer hotel appearance and lobby were updated but room was a complete disappointment. It's clean, the staff is cordial, and the beds were comfortable. We also called down to the front desk for more towels, soap and tea but were told we had to come down and get it. The elevator was out and there were dirty, obnoxious people staying at the hotel. Close enough to Atlanta to be useful and we visited Marietta which was close by too. Additionally, the Pavilion Pantry offers options that guests can make and eat in their rooms. The Cobb Galleria Centre, a shopping mall, is 2.6 miles away. We had a wake up service and they were prompt and efficient. You fix that then u have the best hotel in the area. The breakfast was delicious with many options and staff willing to accommodate unusually dietary requirements. The hotel is slightly more than 20 minutes away from Six Flags Over Georgia by car. Had an excellent night's rest here and I'd definitely stay here again. Mostly, we enjoyed our stay at the Hilton, it is centrally located from where we needed to be. A coffee maker, refrigerator and microwave are among the other amenities. The front desk employees have no customer service skills or knowledge of the hotel. This was my first visit her - it won't be my last. the fish & chips, the fish was hard but the chips were good. This was definitely not the Hilton experience we are used to. Really disappointed with this location- as I have not had same experience at other Garden Inns. I have stayed here several times and will stay at the Garden Inn again.
Maybe the room a little small and we had to wait 20 mins before we could check in, even though we'd arrived after check in time. The All Seasons Paris Gare de l'Est Château Landon is a 3 star hotel which is located between Gare de l'Est and Gare du Nord. Outside of that, it was clean, comfortable, and spacious enough for 4 of us. The location was 10 easy steps to the metro and this made it worth it. Staff helpful with the local area, eating out and sightseeing. It was our first time in Paris via Eurostar from London, so we wanted to stay near the train station. The hotel is great for those who wants to stay near and the metro station is just next door. Room was clean, of course small compared to US standards but all you needed. You should be out enjoying Paris not hold up into the room. The location is great - lots of public transport links and eateries! From the hotel you can easily walk to the Pompidou Center, the Halles and, with a few more steps, to the rue de Rivoli. The staff at this hotel have to be some of the most freindly and cutomer servce focused I have ever expercienced. When trying to used the card key to gain entry to my hotel it did not work. My only complaint would be no fridge in the room. Took the elevator back down from the 8th floor, where  I was sent back up with another key. The reception welcomes guests 24 hours a day and the bar is open daily from 11 am to 11 pm. When I asked if they had any other rooms they could switch me to, they said the hotel was fully booked. Its central location allows a quick and easy access to major attractions of the capital. The service was great and the breakfast was excellent all very well priced considering its location etc. Breakfast is included in the price of the room and is prepared by a dietician. I then went back down to the lobby where I waited for 5-10 minutes, before staff said they'd put us in another room of a guest that hadn't checked in yet. Only limitation was the room bathroom which could do with an upgrade in decor. The continental breakfast was fresh and tasty, a great start. It was a good place, perfect location for a holiday in Paris! The only down side to this is that the noise from the all night trains meant the window couldn't be opened. Would definitely advise staying here for a cheap but pleasant stay near to the city centre. For families, the "Family Pack" offers many advantages such as baby equipment, children's menus served in adapted dishes and console games and gifts are provided. Situated above Landon Metro, this budget hotel is great for access to Gare du Nord and Gare de l’Est. Alas let down by lack of air con, so had very disturbed nights with the window open listening to every police siren going. The breakfast was traditional French with simply croissants, cheese and juice and left us wanting more. Could have done with an extra pillow though I admit I didn't ask for one. I assume it was a staff member otherwise I'd be concerned that other guests can access more than their own room's door - either way it was disturbing. Being next door to the Métro was very convenient for getting around the city, but there were also places to go nearby on foot (restaurants, stores, etc. Also at some point in the night someone opened our door and came into the room... Breakfast was great and the staff were super friendly & helpful. The hotel was extremely full over the Easter weekend and the staff were genuinely helpful in whatever was required from them. I would recommend this hotel in term sof location, price and most certainly cutomed service. Its 160 rooms, some of which are accessible to disabled people, are all air conditioned and equipped with WiFi internet access and a flat screen TV with satellite. Decorated in a contemporary colourful style, they all have a full bathroom and a private safe. When that didn't work, one of the staff came up to the door and tried to reprogram the key. Upon checking in was informed they only had single beds. Room is clean, breakfast is good but no cooked food.
The cheerful greetings from housekeeping, the smiles from the valet staff, engaging conversations from the servers in the restaurants, and the congenial reception from the front desk clerk all combine for a well staffed team. Thank you all for continually making me feel at home! The spicket for shower in the bathroom was very loose and I felt like it might fall off. Very courteous staff and nice to have 24/7 place in the hotel to get snacks. Great location, room was nice but coffe pot gross where you put the water (white flakes floating around in it when you put water in. Hotel location is excellent for restaurant/bar hopping and sightseeing venues. Need to have the option for a client to be able to check out at the same time as checking in so nobody feels cheated for the amount of days they paid. Paid for a higher floor but only got the 2nd floor. The staff was welcoming and helpful with anything you would need. All the guest rooms have a large desk, mini refrigerator, coffee making facilities, air conditioning, living/sitting area, alarm clock, iron, ironing board, cable/satelite television with in room movies and telephone. Very practical in so many ways, free beach towels (as many as you want), free clothes dryer, pool is open late, fast elevators, easy checkout, staff is always working/cleaning, perfect location for food/beach/essentials, room was in great condition, and a beautiful view (went for oceanfront). Hotel was very clean ,stuff were very helpful, right next to the beach ,you have a lot of choices for food and activities everything was walking distance. The Courtyard Fort Lauderdale Beach is a three star property located in the city of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. You can walk to lots of restaurants and the beach is directly across the street. Quick walk to the beach with a nice bar on the way. Stayed for one night after a cruise out of Miami. That was nice but, around 8pm music started at a nearby bar and it was very loud. Hotel is not far from airport and close to everything. The hotel is in a great location, with a nice pool and nice indoor amenities. The location is great, the staff especially the consierge were extremely helpful. staff very helpful, exit right on beach, pool small but pleasant, lots of towels,refrigerator helpful. Unable to sit by the pool, we had to walk through the construction site in order to get to the beach and it cost us $42 per day to rent an umbrella and chairs. The room was nice, had a separate area with couch and a second tv. The staff were all friendly and they upgraded our room for free The hotel has an heated outdoor swimming pool for guests to enjoy. Friendly staff and a very nice room with an amazing view. My boyfriend and I wanted a nice weekend getaway and joined some friends in Ft. Lauderdale. Steps away from a clean, pretty beach and close to shopping and dining. Only problem was fruit flies or nats I pool tiki area. Needs more options inside the hotel to eat besides the Bistro. Beach is just across the street though the chair rental is $12 & umbrella is $20 from a beach vendor. Hotel staff from check-in, to valet to Bistro staff friendly and helpful. I was unable to use the stairs due to a partial military disability. Also, the elevators were apparently being worked on and we had to wait for every elevator ride, sometimes as long as 10-12 minutes. Front desk is not inviting at all.It does not reflect the posted pictures.pool area is just bad. The pool was closed and no one bothered to make us aware of that beforehand. In addition, the hotel let us stay an extra hour to check out. I think this is something that should definitely be addressed by the hotel as I definitely for this reason would not recommend this hotel for Summer/Fall........ Any time an issue has arisen, they are quick to address and correct it. With that in mind they have bottle water next to the coffee pot for sale for $6.00 to make your coffee. The hotel is just a short drive away from the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. The other two elevators took for ever and were always overcrowded. As soon as I got to my room we noticed it was not properly cleaned so I contacted reception and they changed us right away. Love the cafe with good food for morning, noon, & night as well as small bar. I stayed here about 18 months ago for 5 nights and gave the hotel a decent but not great rating. We enjoy the Courtyard for our stay prior to our spring cruises. The shower by the pool didn't work with caused us to drag sand back into the room (felt bad for the maid). The handle  for hot water to the sink took a lot of muscle to turn it on. The hotel has onsite laundry and there is valet dry cleaning available. It is a great location, with restaurants and stores nearby. The pool area is still drab and the outdoor bar and longue area needs a good rehab. It was overall a very nice one night getaway, 10 miles away from home. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be near the action, restaurants and on the beach. Our stay there was pleasant and the location is also great if you want to find fun and drinks walking distance at night. The hotel has 2 meeting rooms with a maximum capacity of 70 people. Parking is extra but other than that, we had an amazing vacation. We had a very nice room with corner and view of the ocean. It’s no transportation to this hotel fromFLL Aeroport but Orbits sells it!!! Check in was not great so don’t bother getting there early cause your room will not be ready until after 3:30 regardless if your check in time. I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service or concern illustrated during my visit. Restaurants, bars, shops and the beach are just steps away. In fairness, the hotel was in the middle of a rehab to rooms and public areas at the time. The breakfast area serves very good quality items with quality Starbucks coffee. We chose this hotel because of the ability of checking in at any time and being across from the beach. while the facilities are in great condition, the location and the staff make the experience even better. The hotel has 171 guest room and 90 suites divided over 12 floors. great hotel middle of sea breeze strip green areas plus the beach is great very clean boardwalk really nice running , biking ...great . Rooms are very clean and the beds are unusually comfortable. Had we known in advance, we would have opted for another hotel. Its a fantastic place, we have stayed there twice now and its been amazing both times. The hotel is right near the beach and close to shops, restaurants and bars. He said nothing else, just continued to check his computer. I travel to Fort Lauderdale several times a year and always stay at this location. Last minute travel...took what we could get.....there are many that are better, till, not bad! There is a fitness center at the hotel with cardiovascular equipment and free weights. Room was not ready for me and many when I arrived. Elevators a constant issue, poor food service both food quality and service was poor. Room looked over a parking lot and tops of smaller stores, but to the right was the beach, to the left the marina. We had a good time, our room was clean and comfortable. We checked in early online but it didn’t help a bit. Pool is smallish, not resort-like, but does have a spacious double decker deck and a nice tiki bar pool. Not to mention that the elevators were so dirty, we even reported urine in one of the elevators. The hair dryer looked like it has been used and abused and seemed to work at 50%. everything was in walking distance, the beach, restaurants and bars, even the international swimming hall of fame! There isnt much to do in the hotel, but you really should not stay in the hotel if you are planning to go to fort lauderdale, especially this location. We had a room with a side view so we were able to see the ocean. I don't generally give negative reviews but I felt the need this time. Price fluctuates a lot, so check a couple of times before you go to see if it gets lowered. Excellent location,but should get a makeover.he overall condition of the hotel needs big improvement. Room not ready until an hour and a half past check-in. Water is also a funny color but the have a note saying to ignore the color of the water and it is safe. We were in the 8th floor so I can’t imagine what it was like on a lower level. Room cleaning poor and room not available till post 4pm seemed to be the norm. The first day we returned to the room at 3:30pm and the room had not been cleaned. The staff is so friendly, it feels like I'm visiting family as opposed to business associates. I was there for business nearby but this property is fantastic for vacation. Our room was not ready when we arrive at 4 so the front desk person gave us a free breakfast which was very delicious. We clearly opened the door for at least an apology, NOTHING! The hotel was very busy, yet the staff, from the concierge to the front desk and the folks in the restaurant were unbelievable! Hotel has nothing exciting in it, no bar or nice restaurants as part of the hotel. Enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Courtyard Great location on the beach,  Staff were very accommodating despite Spring Break fever They allowed us to check in VERY early for free which was such a pleasant surprise after a long week of travel with a little one. The one big drawback is that maybe not in Winter/Spring but definitely in Summer/Fall when weather is very hot there are no umbrellas by the loungers on the patio only at the tables.........also there is no shade in the area of the sun loungers which is no suitable for parents with young children, elderly or disabled people who do not want to be near the pool.............there are loungers and umbrellas to be rented on the beach but they charge a very high  $40 (cash only) fee............... VERY NICE LOCATION,  FOOD AT THE BISTRO WAS GOOD, WELL PRICED. The front desk supervisor Zondria was super nice and upgraded us to a better view. The hotel has a Blue Water restaurant which serves breakfast but there is also the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company which serves lunch and dinner. We had a check in for 4:00 and had to wait till almost 5:00 for both of our rooms due to housekeeping being behind. Service should have been mandated specially during a busy weekend. The bed was not very comfy but the room was very clean. They went out of their way to make us feel invited. We complained about the a/c not working properly in our room and we were told that someone would come check it. One of the elevators was down the entire weekend, what an inconvenience. When we checked out, the clerk asked us how our stay was and we replied not too good. The outdoor shower wasn’t really working, but I trust it will be soon based on the rest of the grounds/staff. Hotel doesn't look like much from the outside, but was pleased overall. Everyone was attentive and top notch, five stars across the board! Without fail, one of the best hotels I have stayed in repeatedly. The pool, which was just upgraded, looked like it needed an upgrade; however with the beach so close, we didn't really care.
The tv did not work properly we called the desk to ask for assistance with the issue, the response unplug the cable and plug it back in. Also I went into the kitchen to grab a spoon the whole front of the drawer fell off. Although the tv was a small issue you shouldn't have to work on tv's on vacation. We went out to eat came back the the tv would not work again. TownePlace Suites Savannah Airport is located a little over one mile from the YMCA and Tanger Outlets Savannah, eight miles from the Historic District, 30 minutes from Hunter Army Airfield and less than an hour from Tybee Beach. The hotel is clean and the rooms large and comfortable. The hotel features a gym, laundry facilities, a picnic area, a hot tub and free coffee and newspapers in the lobby. Bed wasn't very comfortable to me and the elevator was super slow. The cable service for the hotel was terrible, no on demand when you want to just stay in and enjoy those little things are important. My wife and I was there for anniversary and just wanted to relax. If you are visiting Savannah, its not too bad of a drive to downtown area, but allow yourself at least 30 minutes travel time by car. All suites include air-conditioning, free high-speed Wi-Fi, cable TV, premium bedding, and a fully-equipped kitchen with a microwave, a refrigerator, a stove, pots, pans and utensils. Guests can enjoy a complimentary breakfast, and some of the restaurants within a mile of the hotel include Sam Snead’s Oak Grill & Tavern, Zaxby’s, Carey Hilliard’s and Chili’s Grill & Bar. There should definitely be a broom and dust pan in the rooms for use when in the kitchen or with a cat who gets litter on the floor. Just about a 5 minute drive to airport, same distance to a new outlet mall and dozens of restaurants. Clean, comfortable & very conveniently located near Savannah / Hilton Head Airport The stay was great compared to the other hotel  I stayed in was sleep  Inn and suites terrible. So this let's me know this was an ongoing issue of the tv. The hotel is easy to get to, well maintained, and in a great location for food and shopping. The hotel allows pets and on-site parking is available at no charge. Never heard any airplane noise, no noise in halls, slept very comfortably all three nights. This is a very nice and clean property conveniently located close to the airport but also near plenty of shopping, dining, and a Walmart for all needs. Hotel staff was nice, though I had no special needs so very little interaction was necessary. Even though its near the airport, I only heard one plane and that was with the window open. Easy in and out if in a hurry to get down the road My stay at the Towneplace was excellent the room was beyond comfortable the staff was great and the location has everything you need or want within 1 mile of the hotel TownePlace Suites Savannah Airport provides guests with Southern hospitality in its spacious rooms.
Got two rooms and only used one since the other one was in such bad conditions   Breakfast, tv signal, WiFi and transportation was a joke- It says it has a free breakfast all it serves is toast and Waffles. Other than that the room was clean and comfortable but no remote for the TV. The room was outdated plus I had the laundry and ice machine running  all night long. Furnitures are so old and outdated with surfaces peeling off; 3. It was a bit chilly during our stay which made it unpleasant. The room they gave me which they said was the only room available smelled of cleaning supplies and bug spray. The help at the desk wasn't willing to try and help me or show any concern. The main check in had a huge broken section and there was trash overflowing all the recepticals. Floors stayed pretty gritty, washcloths omitted for two days, and toilet tissue not replenished. hotel was just what I expected... horrible... but thanks for the stay There is no coffee maker in the room as opposed to the advertisement in their website and the little microwave has no base plate to heat the food on; 5. This hotel has not been updated in 40 years, rust around the bathtubs, room lamps from 1980 and light switches from 1940. My husband is gluten-sensitive and there was nothing he could eat at breakfast. Breakfast area is outdoors by the pool enclosed in a tent with very small area and few tables to accommodate  the guests. You have to fall in a long line just to get some toasts and another line to get some coffee or waffles. We thought we walked into someone else's room by accident. Good points very friendly reception staff and 30 minute walk from universal studios. Bed sheets, blankets and pillows were all wrinkled--seemed as though these weren't cleaned. The hotel provides complimentary continental breakfast, a heated pool, free parking and a complimentary shuttle to Disney World and Universal Studios. This hotel is not recommended due to following reasons: 1. And the breakfast ran out of water, therefore there was no coffee or hot water and the juice machine was giving straight cordial which could make you sick. The bathroom faucet knob fell off upon first use, it wasn't attached in the first place. Also breakfast area was outside on a patio with plastic covering the windows. The floor was stained all over and it was pretty disgusting. Don't waste your time with this place, very shady business. My son said it looks like a long line for some relief goods. The only good thing about this hotel is it’s only 1.5 to 2 mi away from universal studios. Hotel facilities and appliances are too old, from my bed I heard everything (2nd floor an pleople walking out of my room) I had to speak with the staff because I didn’t receive room service (cleaning) bad experience. The entire hotel smelled like weed and we could get strong weed smells coming in from other rooms throughout the stay. Their tub is not draining well during showers and so slippery with no anti skid mat or surface. The Hotel is confortable and close to the parks, restaurants and shopping. This hotel should be ashamed to charge what they do, the only reason they can is the location. I wouldn't go back and I'm sad I wasted money here. It takes 13 minutes to drive to downtown Orlando and 21 minutes to get to the airport. I didn't make the request, it was listed as an amenity. I booked this hotel due to the free late check out and the lady at the desk told me it was a request and not guaranteed and that it couldn't be granted. Security is not good coz you can enter the back door even without your card. Staff was nice but hotel is a little worn down. There shoud be more choices and easier access for guest. The rooms feature premium cable TV, a hair dryer and a safe, and for an additional fee guests can rent a refrigerator, microwave and rollaway bed. Dresser had two pair of someone else's underwear in it upon check-in. It is apparent that the ownership does not care which trickles down to the staff. The the AC quit working at 2 in the morning. Room not cleaned under bed made a disgusting find on last day that had been there for whole 2 weeks spoke to staff who said manager would get back to us but they didn’t, door left open by cleaning staff one day. The hotel does not have a restaurant, but the neighborhood offers plenty of choices within walking distance. Enjoyed being able to access the pool from our sliding glass doors. This hotel does the bare minimum to pass as an actual hotel. Stayed for 4 nights and got two rooms, one room had an ok bathroom the other had mold on door, walls and under the sink. But when we got to our room the telephone was disconnected from the wall and sitting on the bed next to a hanger and there was a water bottle in the trash. And again, the staff working the breakfast was kind and helpful. The lady at the front desk said she can't do anything about it. It needs updating, but was being remodeled while I was there. The room was beat up as some of the metal corner beads were heavily rusted/Corroded/missing to 6 inches from the floor. Hotel double booked my reservation but only told me at check in that I had one room then charged my card twice for the second room. Water level almost about to overflow after your shower; 6. When we spoke to another employee the next morning, she told us we would have the late check out... Did not want to refund for the no show Really bad way to do business, difinity will not stay there again. We just walked to a small resto across the street to have a decent breakfast; 4. The bathtub was too high up probably not up to code and my daughters nearly fell twice while getting in due to it being slippery. Breakfast layout was an unorganized mess with not enough room. It's was a last min choice and seemed like a good spot, but itbwas pretty bad. The toilet was broke and was running all night . She said there was nobody that could help us and if we spoke to the manager she would tell us the same thing. At check in we’ were told only way to get rooms close to one another would be in second floor with no elevator so had to carry luggage up staircase. Room was decent except for lack of hot water on 1st night of stay. I will never go back to this hotel no more even if it’s the cheapest one coz the amount I paid for is not even worth it . The shower didn’t work properly, the doors were scuffed, one of the beds was broken and my daughter found a cockroach. Forgot the room key on one occasions and receptionist was horrible, provided me with a key that was not programmed when returned to front desk she sent employee who was painting to help only to  have him use a spare key he had because original didn’t Work. The room was way overpriced, dirty, unlevel floors, moisture from window caused slick floor, floor uneven, bathroom door veneer in disrepair, rim on sink had black mold, rusty door frame in bathroom, towel bar missing, furniture scratched and outdated, The Floridian Express Orlando is less than two miles from Universal Studios, Pirate’s Cove Dinner Adventures and Titanic the Experience. I have stayed in plenty other cheap rooms in Orlando that were much nicer than this one! There was another guest having similar issues and treated her the same. Loved the hardwood floors and comfy beds, but sink facet was broken and shower didn't have hot water until the end. We chose a hotel partially based on complimentary breakfast but only ate breakfast there one day of our three days because of the way it's set up. The room smells so bad like a mixture of strong chlorox and nasty molds. Some of the staff acted as if you were bothering them, security was witnessed on his cell phone for the entire hour he was observed by me. But that is what I paid for and picked this hotel for! The breakfast is pretty minimal, but what they have is good. Said my reservation was cancelled,  then told me they only had a room for one of my 2 night stay. Had to have room keys reprogrammed several times a day. I’m pretty sure they don’t change the sheets after every check out too. It triggered a bad allergy and headache my entire stay; 2. This is a great choice, if you want to worry about bugs and the general health of the chemical air you’re breathing.Even though I checked in and checked out before the actual check in time, they still charged me for the night and left me scurrying around trying to find another place to lay my head. Granted I showed up 15 minutes before it was supposed to end, but the line for THE single waffle maker was about 12-15 people long. The air conditioning was set at 54° to manage the smell. If you choose to stay here, just know that it is going to be poor quality. I guess this is why their website pictures show close-ups of people talking with staff and few detailed facility pictures. However it is the only hotel my wife has said she wouldn’t return to. The maid service did not even come into the room to freshen or leave clean towels let alone do the other things most motels do when staying several nights in a row. The toilet in the room broke and was reported but never fixed. The room had inoperable bathroom lights (worked when they wanted to). Conveniently located on International Drive, the Floridian Express Orlando (formerly the Floridian Express International Drive) is within walking distance of Wet ‘n Wild and SkyVenture Orlando. The cleanness of the hotel is An Hit An Miss..... Bring your Bleach & Disinfectant spray an your house shoes. The rooms are discusting roachs peeling paint and filthy walls Terrible experience was not expecting a 5 star hotel but also not one that has mold in the bathroom so bad was forced to sleep in other room with all children   Was told could only have room in same floor if took second floor with no staircase
The rooms are in dire need of a facelift...very clean but carpet and linens in poor condition. Just off the intersection of I69 and 610, in the heart of some of the most exclusive shops in the city of Houston. I did think the breakfast buffet was a little pricey, $19 / person, but did not see what was included, you should ask before using. my opinion on this matter probably does not get much consideration, but if you stay more than 2 nights, why not give guest a break on self parking cost Excellent sweets with privacy for sleeping while others watch TV in the living room. Hotel was near conference and was very easy to get in and out. Within walking distance of the Galleria and River Oaks District, and an easy Uber ride to downtown. The suite was very spacious, three rooms, big bathroom and bedroom, separate living area with a wet bar and frig. The hotel is a class act of the days when hotels had personality. Had a very nice stay here....it's within walking distance to PLENTY of restaurants, shopping, etc! This is very busy location so if you are looking for quite this is not the place for you. Beside 610 so was easy to go in to Houston and out from that location. Only one FYI, if you have a vehicle, it will cost you $22 / day to park To have a free shuttle to any place within 3 miles was an added bonus! I think this hotel should be a 3 star and not 4. The Sheraton staff were great and the room was in perfect order. This hotel is easily accessible and has great proximity to the Galleria Mall and many shops and restaurants. If you love shopping, the galleria is across the street. Sage Restaurant serves American cuisine and Wildplum Lounge has a wide range of cocktails and other refreshments. Space Center Houston is 33.5 miles away from Sheraton Suites Houston Near the Galleria. I got in very late in the morning and left very early when I flew out, was very accommodating and friendly. We stayed to celebrate valentines early and it was the perfect location! Paying for parking when you're not downtown is a joke. It's nice to have the extra room with large TV in the sitting room. You can also access the lounge 24 hours to grab a soda or a coffee from the expresso machine. All suites come with an en-suite bathroom with complimentary toiletries, flat-screen TVs, separate living area with a work desk, free Wi-Fi and a refrigerator. Down stairs restaurant is very  spacious, great dinner options and breakfast. Walking distance to all of these and easy access back onto the 610 Loop for travels elsewhere. I was the only person checking in still took 30 minutes This was an excellent place to stay for a weekend in Houston. Good location, room was hot and under blanket was dirty on the inside As a single person, I felt safe in the surrounding area and when visiting further locations like the Museums and Space Center, used their shuttle services locally, then Uber services and the Concierge services. Was excellent accommodations from checkin to check out with staff. Food service can be erratic, but basics are good - burger is always good. Location is terrific and the staff were extremely accommodating and helpful. Room was o.k.. for the price you would think parking was included...NOPE 25 dollars a day on top of your room cost. However, I didn’t get a bill for incidentals in my way out, they said they will email it ASAP on Thursday. This 4-star hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service within three miles and boasts an outdoor pool, as well as a whirlpool. The hotel staff was friendly and gave me a room upgrade to a mini suite, I only wish I had had more time to enjoy. Wonderful stay for 4 days at the Sheraton, so close to your favorite restaurants and shopping, walked to locations. It’s older and not in perfect condition but so am I! Sheraton Suites Houston Near the Galleria is an all-suite hotel in the Uptown sector of Houston, Texas, within ten minutes’ walk of The Galleria mall, Williams Tower and the Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park. Definitely a very nice and roomy suite for a nice price room is clean and I like its suite layout very much. Today is Saturday and I am still waiting for it -it is my only criticism- My family and I have stayed here many times before and have always had great service and friendly people. The rooms had a real welcome feel..everything was nice and clean.. They helped me finding a Cab went out of there to help me with a Date night with my girlfriend ! You can close off the living area from the bedroom with sliding doors.Really nice pool and workout center. Check out the website for pictures, I know you will be impressed !!!!! This is the 2nd time we stay here and will definitely be back. Food, clothing retailers, the Galleria shopping mall surround this property. nice room,  I know this hotel's parking charge is probably in line with other similar hotels. Please notice you will be cherged $25 a day for selfparking (35 valet) We had to be close to a certain location and for that, the hotel was perfect. Very nice hotel, parking is expensive at $22 per night. When checking in we saw pets walking through the lobby. It was nice that all our wedding activities were close by to the hotel. Great hotel, recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable, quiet hotel. We will certainly stay there again when we return to Houston. We upgraded to a club floor which gave us free breakfast, free wifi and free evening canapés in the club lounge. Paid self-parking and valet parking are available, as well as dry cleaning and concierge services. Excellent location of the hotel, not to far from the city. The smoke-free hotel features a Sheraton Club Lounge, 24-hour front desk, fitness center, computers at reception and events space for up to 300 guests.
It would be very easy to have a fall and break some bones. We loved having a balcony and the proximity to major attractions. Was ok would have liked to have a fridge and kettle, but was very cheap. The location is excellent in terms of proximity to the RER - Port Royal (right in front of the hotel), Luxembourg Gardens (right across the street) and a bank, boulangerie and a handful of restaurants. The hotel Beauvoir is at the Port Royal metro RER station  and close to restaurants, coffee shops and the Luxembourg Graden. The cleaning staff did a very good job of providing clean towels, and other essentials. The carpet needs replacing in our room, as there were some stains on it. Right across the street is the famous restaurant, La Closerie des Lilas, and there are several other cafes and shops within walking distance. With a few updates regarding rooms, I would return to this hotel, as it fitted our needs, and the area was nice and I felt safe walking around either during the day or night. Would not rate more than two stars, unless some improvements are carried out. Breakfast is served each morning, and includes croissants and juices. Bed is ok, we only used it for a place to sleep as we were out all day. From the airport (CDG), this hotel was just 9 stops away. Also i arrived a bit early but they were reluctant to offer the room early if possible even if it was ready. Now for the bad things, the shower is quite small and a person has to be careful not to slip and fall. Beauvoir Hotel is a reasonably priced, nicely presented, modest hotel option on the left bank. The good things about this hotel was that it was right across the street from the Metro Line and bus stops. The room was ok, carpeting could use replacing and new bed spreads too. The staff are pleasant and responsive and the rooms/lobby kept impeccably clean. Lift fitted 2 people in it and 2 bags only...very claustrophobic ! My recommendation would be to take a room with a full/double bed to increase comfort. Guests can enjoy the convenience of a 24-hour reception desk as well as fax and photocopying services. The only thing they have and the only reason why we chose this hotel was its close proximity to the RER B line. Beauvoir is a three star hotel right in the heart of Paris, just moments away from Port Royal RER, Boulevard Saint-Michel and Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and the famous brasseries of Boulevard du Montparnasse. Ok...but i prefer to walk around and have diferent experiences..clean ...carpet could be changed and that could be an upgrade... It's a stone's throw from a main RER station with direct line to airport and easy to get to Disneyland. Small outdated room, tiny shower that has no power but does give hot water. All in all it was pleasant with excellent transport links and value for money. Room was very old and small but toilet was clean A microwave would be nice, if space was available and maybe a small refrigerator too. This rating is for a room for one person only. The breakfast was continental style, but was more than enough to cure the hunger pains each morning. If your stay requires you to be on the left bank a lot then this is an ideal low-cost option. The twin bed room was very small, the bed being a little too small to sleep well. Beauvoir is located near many of Paris's attractions including the Louvre, which is only two kilometres away, and Notre Dame, which is only 1.7 kilometres away. The breakfast staff was excellent, friendly and went out of their way to take care of you. A lot of noise in the hallways from slamming of doors from other guests was also annoying. Go to a better hotel if you can afford it. Good Location,but it ends there.Hotel staff gave us the key and the service ended there. Nice tiny room with a nice view to Blvd S Michel...i like small hotels so this one was good for me ..only 5 rooms each floor ...the location excellent for me ...friendly staff...i tried breakfast once. Single, double, and twin rooms are available, and their suite features a stunning view of the city. Each of their tastefully appointed guest rooms are furnished with free Wi-Fi, a flat screen TV, hairdryer, telephone, and a safe. We had a balcony that had good views of the local area, very close to cafés and markets. Room was small,no facilities.Shower was that small that when I turned in the shower,I continually hit the on/off lever and I am of average build. It is dated though but right next to the rer train to cdg airport. It is low cost room daily rate when compared to 3 stars hotels.
The hotel is 450 metres from Bikini Berlin, a shopping centre, and the same distance from Stage Theater of the West. Restaurant 44 serves modern Swiss fare for evening meals, plus a breakfast buffet. Alternatively, guests can walk a bit further to reach the Photography Museum, 700 metres away. Couldn't ask for a better place to stay in Berlin. Very friendly staff, great location, good breakfast and room amenities (Nespresso machine), firm but comfortable beds. the local German population is a bit thin on the ground due to the influx of workers from many other parts of the world, but if you look really hard you will find traditional German pubs food, beer, and entertainment, but venture off the tourist trail .. still a great city to visit though. Moreover, Grande Galerie has coffee and snacks, while the Palermo Bar provides tempting cocktails. Got the airport express train then 10 min walk to hotel. It was way too hard and felt like there were no springs at all. The room was modern, spacious with wonderful views of the Ku’damm. This hotel has both a Finnish sauna and a gym. Great location to explore Berlin on S Bahn and underground. Their attention to detail was excellent even noticing that it was my friends birthday whilst we were staying and leaving her a card and birthday cake. Guests can stay productive at the spacious work desks, which feature ergonomic chairs and tablet computers. Travellers can use the property's underground car park for a surcharge. Excellent hotel, great place to spend a few days while exploring Berlin. There are 316 rooms at Swissotel Am Kurfürstendamm, each one offering free Wi-Fi. I was very annoyed and sent an angry email to the hotel before I went to bed, and first thing the day after I got a new and lovely room. I also got a brilliant surprise in the afternoon that day, which I enjoyed a lot. Had a really good stay at swissotel the location is in a great spot with easy access to everywhere. It doesn’t have that luxury that 5* hotel should have. Rooms were very clean and comfortable, apart from our room having a huge monument outside our window!! Great visit , made good use of the many transport  options available,flew about the city like  native Berliners its so easy to use . Woukd definitely book this hotel again if returning to Berlin. The hotel staff are excellent and willing to help (marc was very good). The en-suite facilities have separate showers and tubs, plus hair dryers. Hotel good for shopping and near metro station  I feel good about staff stay. It has convenient location, clean rooms, pretty reasonable price for what you get. Subway station across the road made it easy to go East. But Overall had a very pleasant and comfortable stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Berlin! We loved the little tablet with hotel information (much better than printing too much paper like other hotels) and the delicious self-serve coffee. A business hotel first and foremost, rather than an opulent 5 star, but very good at it. Ask for a room high up, and with a view of Kurfurstendam. I also got the last room I guess, an awful smoking room, so I didn't sleep for the first night. We ate breakfast at different cafes nearby but on our last morning chose the hotel breakfast and it was excellent. Super friendly and helpful staff,  beautiful room with an amazing view It also has ten conference rooms and ultra-modern glass lifts. My stay started very bad, I had to wait one hour for check in, as the poor man working at reception was all by himself. The staff was excellent, serviceminded and really nice to me. The hotel is very nice, convinient, highly professional and in a very good location. Located 12 minutes from Aquarium Berlin on foot, Swissotel Am Kurfürstendamm provides guests with an excellent location for exploring. The hotel has no swimming pool, the gym is very stuffy and the water machine is also not working, in the restaurant you wait for an hour for the salad, the room is very stuffy. The best part was that I got a late checkout when I left, which saved my day. Our first trip to Berlin was so positive thanks to the great hotel location and service.
Took us a while to figure out what the noise was! Upon investigating to see what was up, I realized that the window (behind the curtain) had been duct taped shut. Close to Mag Mile so you can walk to shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. My stay was amazing and I have absolutely zero complaints. While there were some minor details that could be addressed, I have never been disappointed by Hampton Inn and this time was no different. There are 11 meeting rooms available which offer a combined space of 18,000 square feet and the hotel can provide audio/visual equipment. Ashley at the front desk was amazing and deserves a pat on the back for being an excellent representative of your hotel! We received a response stating the hotel has already contacted us regarding our concern (which they had not). Hopped a cab to Hampton Inn because we had all our luggage. No problems w/ elevators and staff was great to deal with. I would rather park myself than use valet so when I have to use their service you would think they might be happy visitors with vehicles kind of keep them employed. In the morning that we are checking out the house keeping woke us up at 9:00 o'clock. Super easy to walk all around downtown from this location. The free breakfast is amazing, except for the annoying sound that the waffle maker makes when it's done. Again not a deal breaker, but that chair really wasn't necessary in that small space. However, the big chair in front of the window is very poorly placed. He also said a second compliant would get us kicked out. I thought we would have to wait with our luggage till 3:00 but they were so kind to give us our room before time. Even the staff that knocked on our door said he was listening for 5 minutes and we were not loud but he had to follow through on the compliant. As someone who works in EMS, I kept thinking somebody was flatlining while I was eating my breakfast! The bed was nice and comfortable & big props on the housekeeping for keeping it clean and tidy. 12 of the rooms at the hotel have been especially adapted for disabled guests. Will definitely be back & try to stay more then just one night. Within 2-6 blocks, 360 Bldg (John Hancock), Chi Water Tower, Water Tower Place shopping, Ugh Store, Gino's East pizza and Ghirardelli Chocolate. We recommend this hotel if you are planing your stay in Chicago. We were traveling with a toddler so after the 1st night, I went to the front desk and spoke with Maryanne asking if we could have a new room. Plus, other employees told us the hotel was not full. We got a noise complaint after getting back from a concert and we weren't even loud. We walked to the bean,navy pier, and the water tower from the hotel. Everything seemed fine, however, all night long our heater ran and the room was still cold. Free breakfast included but we chose to go to The Yolk restaurant which was several blocks away. Only negative was our room location, right behind elevators, but we did not ask to be changed. check in was a breeze...the complimentary breakfast was very good, a lot of options! I went back to our room and told my husband what just entailed at the front desk. The only downfall was the wait for the elevator which could be 10 minutes at times. Breakfast was the best continental I have ever had- including a variety of fresh fruit, fresh waffles complete with toppings, and sausage. I had actually stayed at this hotel previously when it was under a different name, so I was somewhat familiar with it. All the guest rooms are non-smoking and include amenities such as televisions with satellite channels, telephones, internet access, work desks, coffee makers, mini bars and individually controlled air conditioning. I was rather disappointed that they rented a room out that was in need of repair like that! I hit my knee and foot on it at least five times during our three day stay. sometime you may need to wait for a long time for the elevator. We were able to get a great deal on this hotel through Travelocity. Breakfast was great, a different hot food item each of the 3 days we stayed. I loved their breakfast buffet.. COMES IN HANDY when you have little kids so the extra money in our pocket was a PLUS xoxox I would recommend this hotel as I had a great stay here. Room was clean and not overly big, but bathroom was good size. Our room was perfect and exactly what we needed, a place to lay our heads and relax after a long day of walking the city. Nice view, nice breakfast buffet, close to water place mall, the movie theatre, & the 360 building. Around the corner from great shopping and close to great restaurants. For business guests there is also a business centre offering a range of business services. The gentleman who checked us in was very courteous and helpful. It might as well have been wide open with the amount of cold air coming in. The hotel was very nice but parking cost $120.00 for two nights. The Sky Bar is located on the 40th floor and offers panoramic views of downtown Chicago. The view was amazing, and the convenience was top notch. Staff was very friendly and was great with my toddler. There was a bit of a mix up with our room, and it was promptly addressed and fixed. It was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. The hotel is very close to main shopping district but it is also close to a medical center so the siren of the ambulances never stop. He got a crib up to our room quickly and called to check on us. The bathroom was clean and has large counter space for all your personal items. We had to turn the thermostat up to 78-80 degrees and listen to the noisy heat register that at times would just blow out cold air. The Elephant & Castle restaurant and pub is located onsite and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner serving up a range of traditional pub food. This hotel has one of the friendliest staff as we've ever experienced. The staff made sure everything went well for us while we were there. Located very close to the city attractions and shopping strores. There are two separate registration desks and when we arrived no one was manning the Hampton side. We had tv on and was talking and all taking showers getting ready for bed. Very small rooms, outdated, extremely expensive parking, $60, very small elevators, when you walk the floor is very uneven and a problem for an old person. We had to wait for the guy to find ish with someone checking into Homewood and then walk across the lobby to check us in. Upon arriving we requested to store the luggage; however, front desk noted our room was ready. Create more separation in the lobby so we don't feel like second class citizens. Our stay was very nice, it is a good location, the staff was very helpful. not only did it look trashy, but it definitely was not helping to keep the cold out! The morning breakfast is very good and is well maintained. Even though I told them that we will be in the room till the check-out time (12:00) they knocked the door once more at 11:00. Our room was directly behind the elevators, which was a bit noisy, but not horrible. Other than that, great staff and perfect location for shopping! I work in the hospitality industry & I know first hand how hard it is to find good housekeepers. The bed was next to window and the room was so cold. This hotel is split between a Homewood Suites and a Hampton Inn, both owned by Hilton. And the wonderful lady at the front desk made sure to accommodate Me to a high floor with a great view of the city like I asked. Overall I was very happy with My stay & will definitely be back again. Hotel was clean, staff was very friendly and the location of the hotel was awesome! I will plan to stay again when we return to the Windy City. The room was nice and clean with flat screen tv. It's a great location and has all you need in close proximity. The window was frosted over with ice all day long. The location of the hotel, both from the Michigan Avenue and the Lake, made this a remarkable find. Only thing I can say is our beds were very soft rather than firm which we prefer. Will stay there again when we go to Chicago again. Perfect location, easy to find good parking places and the breakfast was excellent. If I did not have to wait so long for a down elevator!!! Traveled to Chicago (union station) by train from northwest suburbs. We needed a hotel near Northwestern Memorial, and this was perfect being just a block away. When I mentioned it st the desk, the woman was unfriendly and rude. The only downfall was that the elevators were extremely slow (they share 3 elevators with the Homewood suites), however they offered the maintenance elevator if we waited too long! We were very pleasantly surprised by how well we were treated throughout our stay! Nice hotel, great location close to everything I Love about Chicago. For leisure there is a swimming pool and a fully equipped health and fitness centre. Our check in was till 3:00pm we got there at 8am and they gave us our room right there and then. At checkout, I was told Orbitz will be refunding my credit card for one nights stay. No hot water in shower , the mattress was uncomfortable ,the morning breakfast had eggs that were terrible also the parking attendant the checked me in I be-leave took my Cologne  . Breakfast very nice, may wait awhile for elevstors in morning She said “We don’t have another room, you’ll just need to keep the curtains closed.”  We had the curtains closed all day and night already, thanks for the helpful suggestion not-so pleasant lady! Valet parking was listed at $60 so we found a parking spot for half that two blocks away with SpotHero. A little small but for the price and location it was excellent. The hotel has a total of 351 guest rooms which includes 100 suites. My husband and 3 small children stayed at the Hampton the weekend before Christmas. It's a great location right off of Michigan Avenue with access to anywhere in the city and I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anybody looking for a hotel downtown! On multiple occasions we waited over 25 minutes.... even used the stairs once to go down 16 flights! Stayed at this hotel because of closeness to Magnificent Mile. Overall a great deal, we would stay again for sure. The 4 star Crown Plaza Chicago Magnificent Mile is situated in downtown Chicago 15 miles from O’Hare International Airport.
I was not aware of this additional fee when I booked the room. The staffs helpfulness & professionalism made the bad part tolerable. Was not happy they charged a $50  resort fee. The workers at Paradise Resort were very kind and friendly. Hotel is right by the beach and is conveniently accessible. When we arrived at the hotel there was a mixup in our reservation (my fault). Full kitchens provide a home away from home experience with dishwashers, and a complete list of cookware. 2nd the heater didn’t work) the MOST important thing is that I was quickly accommodated & received a room upgrade. Both beds seems to have a mattress of the consistency of a pullout couch, not good! One of the heated pools where not working but was working on it next day. Other than some of the guest being loud and annoying was a very nice stay. The Tiki bar had good prices ($5-$7 for frozen drinks, you pay $10 at many other places). They call this a resort fee but it really should be inclured in the quoted price. I would stay here again if we had the opportunity. I thought this was very odd, pointless, and took away from the overall hospitality majorly. They even helped locate an Item we left behind and helped us make arrangements to have it shipped back to us. Our room was smaller than most and had only the tiniest sliver of an ocean view. Tanger Outlet, with over 100 shops and dining options is 15 minutes from the Paradise Resort. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to others. And the kids ran up and down the halls yelling at each other. We reached earlier than check in time and the desk was willing to accommodate us as well as took care of giving our preferred floor. This hotel was great for families, with a fantastic view of the beach. The only thing I would change is that I would book directly through the hotel next time. It could have been more enjoyable except for the thousands of motorcycles for Memorial day but that is not the hotels fault. Other couple had same room and just as nice(deluxe King Suite). The hotel was very nice, great view of the ocean, Had to purchase our breakfast separate, but it was a very nice buffet... Checked-in to a warm welcome from the front desk and concierge. We totally enjoyed our relaxing stay and plan to return. I was heading out & she told me that if I got my things together they had ppl who moved your things. So I thought since it was still early, it would t be too bad. Also,  You are given wristbands when checking in that are mandatory to wear while staying in the hotel. Will definitely book again if I'm in the area traveling Me and my family came to Myrtle Beach just for 1 night. TVs are located in both the living room and bedroom. As a retired couple, we loved being on the beach and relaxing in the sun.Thank you Paradise Resort for a great vacation! The party staying at the end of the hall was so incredibly LOUD & disruptive from 9 pm until 4 am. Kick off your shoes and soak up the sun at the Paradise Resort. Though I had a couple of hiccups (1st room smelled like a smoking lounge. The room was great,, the staff was great, the view was great,, couldn't have asked for anything any better Great stay very clean great location  price was good for our stay only thing wish had two bathrooms in room loved the bed in wall the kids loved it my ocean view was fabulous just so beautiful to wake up to should have ice machine on each floor wasn't a big deal but would be nice all the kitchen supplies came in handy cooked good One of the security guards Jason even walked with me to the mini mart down the street that night so I wouldn't have to walk alone. The best place we had ever stayed The staff were the nicest people to be around, can't wait to return! The 2 bedroom 2 bath Ocean Front room was great. You need a car to navigate around, nothing really close around. The friendly staff went out of their way to find us a room to meet our needs. The big pool was dirty with foamy and white stuff stuck around the inside rim of the pool. On my last night I did see a roach in my bathroom. Relaxing peaceful management very pleasant room had everything i could hope for Great place to stay and the food at the restaurant was fantastic! Overall this is the best hotel I have stayed in.. Everything is just on point at this facility.. Never have I stayed at Paradise Resort and had a bad moment or day here It was so inviting to wake up in the morning and see such a beautiful sunrise. My room was on the 20th floor, the view was amazing! Not happy with the check in person who was rude and sarcastic. The only thing we felt was a let down was the breakfast. The staff was amazing, clean rooms, had full kitchen, washer/drier, steps from the beach. Nice hotel, not sure if housekeeping was included but it wasn’t done daily, not a big deal. Guests can choose from condos with up to four bedrooms. The staff was awesome, beautiful view from balcony, beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, kitchen was decently stocked with essentials. They were in the midst of renovations, but what was done was very nice. Keep the family entertained wth a giant chess board, outdoor shuffle board, and a bean bag toss area. It's like staying in a ghost hotel and ghost town. All the facilities including the indoor pool, hot water tub, lazy river were working well. We only stayed a couple nights but it was nice. We chose this hotel because of the locaion and price, very glad we did. Hotel staff was the most helpful I have ever encountered. The entire staff that I came in contact with wa pleasant and very helpful. Was very clean friendly staff great views of the ocean. The staff were not only polite, but ia nviting and helpful. We feel that there is definitely room for improvement for the breakfast. Free DVDs rentals with up to date movies and money off coupons for local restaurants. There were also a bunch of charges that the check in person did not want to explain or elaborate on just that we needed to them. Just a few minutes from family activities, food, and the boardwalk. Around 11 I went to the front desk & requested a room move the next morning bc my 1 y/o FINALLY was able to fall asleep during a few minutes of quiet time. Nothing around is open even restaurant in hotel closes early. I called front desk around 9:40 & asked when “quiet time” kicked in on them grounds. Intended a couple night stay then extended it to 4 nights This was my family’s first trip to Myrtle Beach and it was pretty awesome! We only stay one night and the room was CLEAN, very spacious and comfortable for a family of four. Everything about resort was great but was double charged for resort fees...was charged when booked and charged again at check in The stay was excellent from check-in to check-out I don't have not one complaint. Went in the winter so beaches were quiet and well maintained. The staff seeks to serve the guests and guarantee a good night’s stay. Rooms were clean and the view of the beach was perfect. The next morning the next shift lady informed me that my room move had been done & they were cleaning my room. Definitely needs to do upgrades on Furniture/Beds, for the quality of the hotel Comfort should play more into par other than that its great A breakfast restaurant, as well as a tiki hut snack bar, can be found on-site. The adults argued & cursed each other out in the hallways for abt 3 hours. I wouldn’t mind staying here again but only when it’s slow & kids and drunk adults aren’t running around. So my fiancé had to park his truck at a restaurant down the road. You will be charged $15 per day, per room, in addition to the price you pay ahead of time. It was a relaxing time and the beach was amazing. Featuring an indoor lazy river and newly renovated oceanfront pool, this family-friendly hotel offers gorgeous ocean views, 15 minutes from the 350 acres of shopping, dining and attractions at Broadway at the Beach. Guests can relax or stay fit with the two jacuzzi pools and workout room. I came up to visit my fiancé on a business trip and only one of our cars could use their parking. We enjoyed the pools although they became crowded at times. All staff we had contact with was friendly and helpful.
Choice of hot and cold items on the breakfast buffet. Breakfast was nice with both continental and cooked food although the cooked food appeared to have been all cooked early and kept warm. The reception desk are all very friendly with helpful advice. The Alhambra palace is just over one and a half kilometres away. Breakfast had cooked and cereal/bread options and fresh fruit, coffee and tea were avaliabe. It was a short walk to the Plaza Nueva where you can hop on a bus or the tourist train to the tourist areas of the Alhambra or Albacin (Old town) or Sacromonte (Cave houses) Very convenient located hotel.Friendly small clean quiet.Enjoyed my stay.Great to leave car behind took taxis  and bus and walked.Everything within short distance.Good local reasonable tapas and bars. There is a small refrigerator in the room, but no tea or coffee making facilities - so if you fancy a cuppa, bring your own travel kettle. In terms of price it was great value for such a central location. This hotel is in one of the best locations for exploring the city. From the balcony  we could see the Sierra Nevada... just. Check in was not friendly and the security seems out dated. There are so many other breakfast choices close to the hotel. Very friendly, accommodating staff, hotel near nightlife, shopping and more. This is a great hotel in the most perfect part of town. All of the rooms feature free Wi-Fi, air-conditioning and a flat-screen TV. Perfect location for city shopping site seeing eating etc in our favourite city. The staff were pleasant and helpful, the location is good. We assumed that we meant that was 'free', and could park there for free. There is a guest lounge and computer for guest use. Our room is facing the back alley so it was quiet. Room was a good size, with Juliet balcony overlooking Navas. When I asked the concierge for parking, they directed me to a public parking space around the corner that was 'libre'. Very busy street, bustling with places to eat, but close the windows and you'll sleep right through it. Quite dated / tired room facilities.......we changed to a bigger/ better room at no charge for the second night. Reception is open 24 hours a day and offers a tour desk, currency exchange, luggage, and ski-storage. C3 bus to Alhambra within 5 minutes walk of the hotel. The location is so central and easy to walk everywhere. Restaurants just outside the door and tourist sites within walking distance. It is located in a very popular tapas bar street which is very lively but our room at the back meant we didn't get disturbed by this. There are several bars just outside front door but I can't really go to those In my pyjamas. When we went to get our car the next day, the parking attending wanted 20 euros, cash only. Finding the Hotel by car is impossible, and public parking is very expensive The hotel is basic but clean and have very helpful staff. I told the concierge, and said that she meant 'libre' as in free space, not as in 'gratis' no payment. Perfect location for access to most places, and very quiet position.Would definitely recommend this hotel I paid for the breakfast  one morning and it was awful, awful, awful. Fairly good location, but you can hear everything from the room. I thought that the hotel offered good value for money. Free use of safe in room, just ask on reception for the key. The air conditioning works well and is quiet enough to sleep with it on. Great central location for getting on and off the airport bus, close to eateries and the Corral del Carbón (if you need to print your Alhambra tickets without the walk up to the Alhambra beforehand.) On the street was a good choice of Tapas bars and restaurants, The hotel is also close to the main shopping area. Wifi was very good although it only worked on one of two iPhones. Comfy smart hotel with obliging staff and good breakfast fare. At the time of my stay it was reasonably priced. The Hotel was in a good location, Room was good, clean with comfy beds, we had a front balcony overlooking the street, but it was not a noisy street,  Breakfast for good, plenty of choice. We had a rental car with us and there was no place for us to even briefly park while we checked in as it was a pedestrian street. Our only annoyance was that we were not able to get a drink tea or coffee or hot chocolate last thing at night as no drink making facility either in room or centrally. The room was very clean and comfortable with adjoining bathroom also very clean with good shower etc. This was not an issue for us so we didn't raise it with staff. Granada is famous for its delicious tapas, free in bars when purchasing a drink, and there are bars and restaurants around the hotel. The bed took up most of the room and there was no place to put our luggage out of the way without jumping over it. The private bathroom includes both a bath and shower, together with a hairdryer. Staff were extremely helpful to us during our stay and should be commended. Also, the stairs in the entry way to the hotel don't even have a basic ramp to make it easy to roll your baggage wheels up and town. Navas offers comfortable hotel accommodation on a pedestrian street in the heart of Granada, only five-minutes’ walk from Granada Cathedral. We ran into 3 other travelers who, like us, were struggled to find the hotel which is buried in the middle of a pedestrian-only block.
I told her something had to be done because it was really uncomfortable. Had a cigarette burn in blanket which was extremely noticible,  I don't know how that was missed, bed was made horribly,  as if who ever made it hated their job. We were so happy with the drivers and how they drove and got us in and out of traffic. Have stayed here many times before but the place is becoming rundown and in need of some serious cleaning and maintenance. Found a long black hair in my bed when I was initially checking for bedbugs. I was there for three nights and after the first night, tried to find another hotel. Had a great view of it but the ceiling the next morning showed there was a leak in the roof that was still being worked on. And depending on traffic, there are several ways of getting to the downtown area from this hotel. Problems: The entrance to the pool is a lawsuit waiting to happen. First of all driving to this hotel was an experience, you have to go through horrible parts of town and nothing is around this hotel. I also cleaned up hair left at thebase of the toilet that had been left there by previous guests. When we finally got up to our room it was set to 80 degrees and despite us turning the air down to 60 (as low as it would go) and the fan on high, the room remained at at least 75 degrees. The restaurant inside cook a good burger and as a pretty good free breakfast. Manager said they had a hard time regulating air due to the weather. The hotel was clean, quiet, the beds were very comfortable. Such an interesting building, really enjoyed the bar and restaurant, the room was also very good. As you push open the door you  must immediately step down one step without warning. At one point, after waiting over two hours for the shuttle around 9pm and calling multiple times to be told just ten more minutes before someone finally admitted they'd forgotten me multiple times, the front desk attendant felt it appropriate to tell me I should've just been more of a trooper rather than simply apologizing (much less offering any sort of compensation for the $20 taxi ride I'd finally taken. Bedding is Feather so if your allergic like me make sure you request Feather Free. Hotel restraunt had decent food a bit overpriced for what was served though. The hotel features a commendable outdoor pool, and fitness center. Our room wasnt as clean as it should have been. People were very friendly and the restaurant and bar was so nice too. While checking in, the staff really wouldn't speak to us and spent most of their time on the phone. I immediately called management to come up and packed up our children. Oh yeah, the traffic never stopped except between the hours of 2 AM and 4 AM on the highways, 3 major ones, right in front of the hotel. They have memory foam mattresses, which is impressive, I had never slept on one before. We get a new room where my 7 yr old son finds a pill fragment in the nightstand. Our room was old, dirty and smelled like an old bar. I only had a problem with a breakfast attendant that was rude to my daughter. Long waits for elevators at times especially in the mornings. The room was okay except for the very loud air conditioning/heating unit. He didn't charge us for the stay and we left thankful we didn't get hurt and were never going to be back in that hotel again. In the exercise room, 2 of the 3 exercise machines were out of order, and the service in the attached restaurant / bar was absolutely terrible. Our room was not cleaned on our 2nd day and even after I complained and their manager apologized with a basket of treats, housekeeping still did not replenish soap, shampoo, tissue box, lotion. Upon opening the packaging I realized that the charger was not compatible to my phone. We had dinner in the hotel and the food was just OK it was basic bar food. There was a 2 inch gap between the floor and the room door. The price was very good compared to other hotels in the same area. Most of the time I don't psy attention to the looks and stares but this was over the top so I had a great stay and will be back! I noticed a bar of soap on the floor far back by the wall . Staff are excellent,  hot breakfast, clean rooms & overall satisfied. Finally it is located in the heart of an industrial area and has a working train track in front of it. And the carpet in the room either needs to be replaced or be deep cleaned. I PLAN ON MAKING ANOTHER TRIP TO DENVER AND WILL DEFINATELY STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN!! If you are going to the Denver Coliseum, this is a great choice. Front desk staff is super friendly great customer service here:) Yes, the TV only had about three functional channels and the desk chair was missing a wheel, but those things weren't terribly important to me anyway. We asked for a room with a view and received a room with a delightful view of the highway. The A/C did not work at all but I always travel with a fan so I didn't die from the heat. Maid service to room slow, 2 days room not made up until after 3 pm. I have stayed here a few times and will stay again. The Forney Transportation Museum can be reached through a four-minute drive. Thankfully, they do have a little shop for things like this. Finally, a dirty washcloth was left in the tub and it was not retrieved despite the shower curtain was left open. We didn't check in until about midnight and were greeted when we walked in. I let th staff know and they made note of it. We stayed 4 nights to check out Denver for a possible move. Wi-Fi access, private parking, and area shuttle are offered free of charge. My daughter is a Native American who models for a Native American organization she is Gothic and has her own style and the attendant was very rude to her because of how she looked! We stayed here mainly because of the Shuttle to Coors field. Thank god my room had 2 beds so I just slept in the other one. THE STAFF AT QUAILITY INN DENVER KNEW HOW TO TALK TO AND DIRECT A BLIND PERSON,WHICH IS NOT LIKE OTHER PLACES I HAVE STAYED, ALL IN ALL I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS HOTEL. They did have Feather Free bedding, but only the house keeping staff knows it  The location is close the the highway, which has its benefits and drawbacks The area that the hotel is in is industrial, deserted, and on the very outskirts of town. Our first night, we were told not to go past the bridge after sundown, which is next to the hotel. Even when you turn it off, you can hear the unit in the next room. The other people checking in tried to make light of it and she was having nothing to do with a smile. The entire hotel was the same temperature so I'm sure the hotel had to no air. The only good thing about this hotel is the extensive shuttle service and friendly shuttle drivers! There's a free shuttle that drops off guests every top of the hour til 10pm. THOUGH THE HOTEL ISNT RIGHT DOWNTOWN THE FREE SHUTTLE MAKES IT A GREAT PLACE TO STAY AT A GOOD PRICE. He was very nice which is why I rated the staff a little better. The next morning was the same and the staff commented that ‘maybe they should get that fixed’  It didn’t inspire confidence that anything would be done about the problem. Betty (supervisor) apologized but said she could not give me a refund of 1st day housekeeping mess because I booked thru Orbitz. When we came back, it was even hotter than when we left! I myself fell off this step and I watched many others do so as well. I GUESS THEY JUST ARE NOT USE TO BEING AROUND SOME ONE THAT HAS A DISABILITY. I can say that the free breakfast was some of the best as far as flavor and quality. The main reason I chose the hotel is that it is close to the highway but has a shuttle running between the hotel and the convention center. Took 17 hours to fix tv we go to sleep with it.After that  everything was okay Front desk people are the best. Perfectly set at the vibrant heart of Denver, the budget-friendly Clarion Denver is located at the intersection of Interstates 25 and 70. Their AC did not work and the heater was out of whack on a snowstorm that Made us sweat all night in the room. I stayed five nights because of my work schedule but should have moved to a different hotel. Our room was comfortable but the bathroom wasn't cleaned well. I booked a no-smoking room through Expedia and the hotel had it down as a smoking room thus we got a smoking room not good. I purchased a charger and went up to my room. How this is possible when they had no open rooms, I'm not sure. From the reservations desk to the restaurant employees and shuttle drivers everyone was very helpful and accommodating. Clarion Denver is only a three-minute drive from the National Western Complex. Hotel/restraunt staff were amazing and kind in every way possible. Furthermore, tasty meals and refreshing beverages are available at the hotel’s Lobby Bar & Restaurant. The room we are in was fairly cramped and there is maybe a foot of space between the end of the king bed and the tv. The room we moved into smelled like dog urine (this hotel also allows pets...), but by this point I had realized that our experience was simply not going to improve, so we went out to buy a few things and febreezed every fabric in the room. I went back down and asked if I could simply switch it I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Our hotel phone did not work and we couldn't shut off the a/c even after notifying the front desk. We get there get to our room and start getting settled when I find a bag of CRYSTAL METH or CRACK behind one of the beds! Air conditioning was broken, asked to have air in room fixed so maintenance came to repair the air, maintenance couldn't fix the air so he bought us a box fan. Service in the bar was unimpressive and the staff was rude. It took us 25 minutes to check in at 11:30 at night because the hotel staff was struggling to work their computers. I go to speak with the manager to tell him we booked a different hotel for the rest of our stay and he WASN'T even told about the meth in our room and he was the GM!! The hotel is older and thus has some minor faults but the breakfast was really good. We ended up getting put on the smoking floor as non-smokers. You can smell both cigarettes and marijuana, and it only gets worse when you enter the elevators. Then, the room had patched and peeling wallpaper, chipped paint on the doors, missing tiles in the bathroom, peeling caulking everywhere, grout that ranged from light gray to black, and a few mold spots on the bathroom ceiling. (Bed wad comfy though)  and Bathroom floor never mopped. As for the hotel itself, this was the first time I have ever been asked to pay in full when I checked in, instead at the end, and I quickly learned why. The air conditioner was not working when I got to the hotel room, and was a known condition when the room was booked. The TV signal was bad, though the WiFi was fine. Had an issue with my iron and house keeping brought me a new one in about 3 minutes. Bad thing is a pot grow not far away stinks up the neighborhood like a bunch of skunks. AS A VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSON I NEEDED LOTS OF EXTRA HELP FROM GETTING MY FOOD TO BOOKING RESERVATIONS FOR ATTRACTIONS DOWNTOWN THE STAFF WERE  MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP . I turned on the air (they do not have the classic units by the window like most hotels) and we left for some activities. one of the front desk ladies was very rude, she seemed to not enjoy her job, was put out by having to check people in. All elevators reek of marijuana and even non smoking floor has strong whiff of pot at night. The Denver Coliseum is only a three-minute drive from the establishment. The staff was friendly, but took no interest in customer satisfaction. This Quality Inn was nicely located next to downtown and the 70 freeway. They told us they would notify other managers and credit the room for the night. Downtown is not walking distance and there's no shop, store or tourist spot close by. The breakfast was delicious and our room was way nicer than expected. In addition, the rooms are equipped with flat screen televisions, ironing facilities, and coffee makers. The beds were bad kept falling down on the ends due to poor frames. This suited me just fine as otherwise I would have to fight downtown traffic and pay for parking. The bath tub floor appeared dirty, maybe it was permanently stained. The room was large and everything  worked well The internet connection was easy I've had better breakfast from school cafeterias served by persons in hairnets than the disaster of gelatinous meat and congealed gravy. The Palm Grill food was a good alternative to going out to eat. My brother who lives local is now recommending his associates stay here. Although the hotel wasn't in the middle of downtown, it is only 10 minutes away. Check in was great, everything was clean and comfortable on the 6th floor. Staff were friendly, rooms were spacious, bathroom was fairly clean, and amenities were plentiful. For one thing, they do allow smoking in the hotel (on the top floors). We had no AC for a week, and power went out for 3 hours one night. The morning brunch was excellent and the front desk staff was very accomodating. The roof was being replaced while we were there and we were on the top floor. Due to my heavy work schedule I decided to stay and let them fix the air conditioner. For the price and the fact they let me smoke cigarettes in my room, (you don't know how hard that is to find in any city any more), this place was pretty good. I found 3 cockroaches in my room Place is turning into a dump THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EVERY THING YOU NEED TO MAKE YOUR STAY SPECIAL. In short, this hotel is only worth booking if you: a) have a car, b) don't mind eating dog food for breakfast, and c) aren't bothered by staff who clearly don't care. Nice hotel decent bar and the free shuttle is great! Fast check in & check out, friendly staff, clean rooms. The white walls, large mirrors, high-quality linens, and ergonomic furniture give a bright and airy atmosphere. I was happy to see that they offered complementary shuttles. The hotel and staff were OK but the air conditioner was broke the whole time There was no hot water and my shower was cold on three occasions. One of the elevators was inoperative and the wait to catch the elevator was too long. I can see no real reason to stay here unless you need easy access to downtown Denver. Free hot breakfast was nice and the food was fresh and tasty. I knew of this hotel from an earlier stay but under the flag of a different company So I had some  experience of the place before. When we got to our room, I noticed that it was stifling hot. Rooms are small , feels like very old hotel with carpet smell and all But you can SMELL it, first thing upon walking in! We arrived just after a football game so the lobby was a bit busy but not crazy. The manager was very friendly and helpful the girls at check in and check out very nice! The mattress was pushed away from the wall so when I went to scoot it back I saw it. My family (2 adults and 3 children) came to denver for a family vacation and we booked this hotel. The outside premises had trash everywhere and a section of grass that apparently is the dog pooping area because the poop is never picked up. I am a 23 year old girl and I did not feel safe staying there alone. On a positive note, the beds were actually pretty comfortable for a budget hotel and, despite being pretty outdated, nothing about the room was obviously unclean. I WAS TREATED BETTER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN TREATED AT ANY HOTEL EVEN 5 STAR HOTELS. Overall experience was okay and would return if rooms were more detailed cleaned! It took about 5 minutes to get any hot water. stay was good but hotel halls and rooms could use a good carpet cleaning The carpet throughout the hotel has horrible stains and trash bags leaning up against the wall, I assume waiting for someone to dispose of. The bed sheets were on inside out and the bed was not completely made. Checked in very around midnight, missed the free breakfast, went next door to a place called Village for breakfast and it was alright but not great. Well later we go eat and come back to a black hotel, power is out in the whole building and we have had enough. Clean rooms, comfy beds, great breakfast, nice staff, enjoyed the shuttle, nice drivers Nice variety something for everyone and staff willing to help. One room super hot - the other room too cold. Real scrambled eggs, great refried beans, sliced and baked ham, mini fried cubed potatoes, biscuits, gravy, pancakes, syrup, milk, oatmeal, cereal, fruit and fruit salad, mini muffins and danishes, and asst. The shuttle service is a joke - they require you to sign up, but don't actually check who's signed up so it turns into a first-come first-served shuttle with way more people than seats available. I called down to the front desk and they said there was nothing they could do because they were fully booked. I liked that you could order from restraunt from hotel room and even have it delivered! My friend needed ice for her knee, and they brought it to us, much appreciated. She spoke to the manager and the manager moved us to a different room.
Each room includes cable TV and a desk, and some have a private bathroom. Just wanted a night's accommodation in Hamburg before my return flight next mornng. Feldstraße Underground Station is a 2-minute walk away, offering direct connections to Hamburg Main Station. A full buffet is provided each morning in the bright breakfast room with street views. This family-run hotel is quietly located in Hamburg’s St. Pauli district, a 10-minute walk from the CHH Exhibition Centre and the Millerntor football stadium. The well-stocked hotel bar is a relaxing place to look back on an eventful day in Hamburg. Turned out it was near the Millentor stadiun where there is a St Pauli fans bar which was very welcoming. S-Bahn and underground trains run to Sternschanze Station, a 5-minute walk away. Rooms at Hotel Pacific Hamburg are simply designed with classic furniture. Private parking spaces can be reserved on site, and the A7 motorway is 10 km away.
Having to may for safe deposit box and pool towels not acceptable. The Deloix Aqua Center hotel is located in the Spanish city of Benidorm. We booked bed and breakfast after reading reviews and thought that you couldn't go wrong with breakfast. It is opened in July 2005 and is categorized with four stars. Had a lovely time at hotel deloix, perfect location just 15 minute walk from the hustle and bustle of busy Benidorm. The only problem was we were 5mins late for breakfast and we were refused For their free time, guests can visit an outdoor pool, where there are hammocks and parasols. They offer equipment such as twin beds, sofa bed, satellite TV, mini bar, heating and safe. It is about 20 minute walk to the beach, or hop on the bus (bus stop outside the hotel). Quite a walk to the beach but plenty of buses to hop onto. Very good hotel this is the third time I have stayed . Deloix Aqua Center has 1200 sq m meeting rooms as well as open areas, which can be used for private parties and business events. Only down side was drilling at 8am from maintenance staff. Clean and comfortable and only a short distance from all the bars Lovely hotel with great facilities and in a great location for Benidorm Palace. It is within walking distance to the beach and bars but away from the noise . The guests are hosted in 190 standard rooms, fully furnished and air conditioned. In the restaurant guests can enjoy Mediterranean and international cuisine The coffee bars offers various national drinks and cocktails. In the spa guests can enjoy the indoor pool, sauna, Jacuzzi and aromatherapy, as well as beauty treatments and various massages. Loved this place although the bar waitress was a bit rude and so unhelpful The guys were great n made it pleasant to stay there The bar girl was not nice at all and to be honest made us feel so unwelcome None of us were drinkers really but if we had been we would certainly take our buisiness elsewhere
My partner and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Holiday Inn Express Amsterdam - Arena Towers is ideally located in the lively south-east area of Amsterdam. In the context of Amsterdam's outrageous hotel prices, this is not a terrible choice, but I would not recommend it. This accommodation is also known as Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Holiday Inn Arena Towers, Holiday Inn Arena Towers Hotel, and Holiday Inn Arena Towers Hotel Amsterdam. These amenities include a 24-hour business centre, meeting room, and paid parking. SMOKERS BEWARE:  Some websites, like Orbitz, give the option for smoking rooms, but the hotel is 100% non-smoking, with absurd penalties for violations. Guests can also dine at the Holiday Inn restaurant in the same building. This leaves you the options of taking expensive taxis, parking in the lot at a hefty fee, or walking about a quarter mile, often in bad weather, to the metro station, waiting for the train, and riding about 20 minutes to Centraal Station. excellent hotel within walking distance of Ziggo Dome, so great for concerts, a fairly new build hotel, which is handy for central amsterdam , just 10 minutes by train. Each air-conditioned room is a home from home with comforts such as soundproofing, free toiletries, private bathroom, desk, hair dryer, and tea/coffee making facilities. They also have a very nice European-style buffet, included in the room price, and public computers. I was never able to obtain an outside telephone line, and had to go down to the lobby to make calls. When I left, the hotel charged me an additional amount for local taxes. Will definitely stay there again, 15 minute train to airport and 20 minute metro to city. Although the public areas of the hotels are impressive, the rooms at the Express are the equivalent of a Motel 6, meaning very small, cramped, no closets or drawers, no clocks, no shampoo or conditioner,and limited coffee/tea service. Your options are to rent a car (and the hotel charges a hefty daily parking fee), take expensive cabs, or walk about a quarter mile (usually in bad weather), wait for the metro, and spend about 20 minutes on the train. Great standard hotel very clean, friendly staff and in a great location. As the result, I had to spend hours wandering around Amsterdam in the rain, exhausted after an 11-hour flight. All in all, while I know hotel prices are absurd in Amsterdam, this was not a good value for me. Bad points:  No early check-in allowed, rooms are the equivalent of a nice Motel 6: small, cramped, no clocks, drawers, shampoo, conditioner, or bathtubs. A continental breakfast is served daily in the Great room where there is also a bar and lounge serving drinks and snacks throughout the day. I was never able to reach an outside line on the telephone (always busy), and had to go to the lobby to make calls. Good points:  Modern, clean hotel with bars and restaurants. Holiday Inn Express Amsterdam - Arena Towers is a five-minute walk from Amsterdam Arena with Schiphol Airport only a ten-minute drive. My Orbitz reservation stated that all taxes and fees were included. The hotel added about 35 euros to the price stated by Orbitz for local taxes,  The hotel is located far from the main part of the city. This is a large, modern complex with restaurants and bars. They do not allow early check-in, even though they have numerous rooms. Some websites, including Orbitz, say that this property has smoking rooms. great place to stay and just beside the ziggo dome where we were going for a concert Guests at this hotel can make use of the facilities at the neighbouring Holiday Inn Amsterdam.

Located in the heart of Salou in Tarragona, Spain, Hotel Best Los Ángeles Salou is a three-star hotel with a terrace and an outdoor pool. They did not honour their verbal agreement that was negotiated with the hotel night manager as agreed with hotels.com. I had to call hotels.com over international phone calls for half hour before it was finally resolved. There wasn't much choice for the English either, and the staff didn't know how to communicate properly with us and got orders wrong which we still had to pay for. You would have thought that a 4star hotel would have had more choice for breakfast, and dinner nothing for veggies apart from chips and potatoes and pizza?! Room was good but it is on a street where there is a irish bar and they play music till 3am! Hotel Best Los Ángeles Salou guests can unwind by taking a dip at the outdoor pool or lounging in the terrace with drinks. Food was not even 'warm' it was cold, they placed the food underneath cold lights and the food instantly got cold. Nice hotel with evening entertainment which can be a bit noisy. Some nice places to visit while staying here include Capellans Beach (0.2 miles), Levante Beach (0.6 miles) and Cala Font Beach(1.4 miles).

The hotel would not let me leave without charging me for a night. We found them running around the floors at night in the room. Very friendly staff, very clean, pool and hot tub were nice and clean. We had our granddaughters with us and where totally discussed room there where cocaroaches in the bathroom so big that we couldn’t stay besides that the sofa bed was so old my granddaughter wouldn’t sleep because you could see the worn out springs and our beds where the same very old and worn out. the office did not help, they tell to call some tech support. The bathroom looked like rust and most had been just painted over and new growth had started. The customer service was horrible, the guest service was really not acceptable. The kids had to walk almost a block through two parking lots to get to the pool area. The rooms were decent but there was a closed up musty spell to both of the rooms we had. You get to hear your neighbors conversations, and if you are lucky and have people on both sides, you get to hear both at once! We were given a room for disabled people, which wouldn't have been a problem, but the shower head could not be adjusted normally. The only reason we selected this hotel is due to it's proximity to the Valley View Casino Arena across the street. We did not experience any roaches like other reviewers but there was a bug in our night stand drawer. The Wyndham Garden was really quite beautiful and much larger than it appeared in the photos. They gave me a parking pass, with no disclosure that it's $14. The shower surround was cracked and had previous holes from earlier fixtures that were not filled correctly. The bathtub felt like it didn’t have support when we stepped in it it felt bubbly like a rubber bath mat. It never really cooled of in the other half of the room. This hotel is conveniently located across from Valley View Casino Center. Good price and great location and lots of outside restaurants. The hotel to stay for pleople visiting Seaword, very nice. Harvey was getting a lashing by his wife it sounded like. I will never book again thru you unless we get a whole refund. All rooms feature flat-screen TVs with HBO service as well as free Wi-Fi. The staff was nice but was understaffed to meet the needs of a hotel of that size . 1 or 2 miles away are a bunch of nicer hotels. They might say there is in-room free wifi but that is a complete lie. The beds were lumpy, did not have a functioning a/c. Instead it’s small rooms tiny parking spaces and very disappointing for the money.sally Hotel was clean and neat but is in need of renovation. Very nice room and clean but you need new carpet. Very old, stinks, rooms falling apart, beds are as hard as boards, my kid is a lot of pain as you can feel bars in her bunk bed mattress. I didn't think the hotel was worth what I paid. They charged an extra $10 per night to park, had no included breakfeast, and their on site bar and grill was closed. they would not take my card over the phone or in an hour when I was arriving, even though my guests we on the reservation. It was lousiest and dirty , don't waste your time or money. The hot & cold water were reversed, and the neighborhood was ok, but not great. Except for the “grand” lobby, which was being cleaned every time I went there, the place  absolutely did not look like what was advertised! The onsite Du-Par's Restaurant and Bakery is open 24 hours, offering a menu of salads, sandwiches, breakfast items and coffee. The rooms were very old and I found ants in my room. The room we stayed in was great in size and layout but that is the only good thing I can say about this hotel from our stay. When we were checking in there were many guests trying to switch rooms. At 3am, we were awakened to the same neighbor being arrested as she totally had dismantled her room and the cops were arresting her! It is not a comfortable stay and the online pictures are misleading. next to me stated parking was an additional $14/per day, but she would discount to $7. I thought maybe because we were from Wisconsin, we would be the few willing to swim in 60 degree weather, but others were out there too. We had to leave the window open (which faced Sports Arena Blvd) to air out the room while we were out. A range of different deluxe rooms and suites to choose from will offer the perfect configuration for your party. I had work to do, and it was a big issue. Once we got to our room we discovered hair and a dead spider in the bathroom. In our 4 days stay we were in 3 rooms. It’s a nice hotel close to a lot of activities,restaurants and the beach One issue - AC was in front room and did not really cool the back bedroom. Unfortunately the lounge/restaurant was not open during our stay, but it was nice there were other restaurant options nearby................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. It is a motel and is not in a good part of San Diego. Probably don't blame them as I would be the same if I worked here. It is located between two very loud streets, and not far from the airport and there is very little in the way of insulation so it is loud. I booked the room because it had a queen bed and a bunk bed for our kids but the front door didn't work right and was hard to open each time and the heater didn't work right and even though I turned it off, made a sound all night. All three nights we had to request pool towels to be restocked. The San Diego airport, Old Town and Belmont Park are also just a short distance away. The pull out bed was the most uncomfortable one I had ever been on. We stayed in a family suit for 4 guest and each time the cleaned room theybwould only give us 2 towels i was like wow. I think this location is a Motel 6 posing as a Wyndham. Shabby and dark,Based on the Travelocity site I thought it was a beautiful resort. The carpet in the room was heavily soiled in some areas and and was torn and frayed in others. The only saving grace is that I booked this through Hotels.com and they gave me a bunch of credits to offset the cost of the one night and for our suffering. I was already disappointed in the additional parking fee on top of the room rate. good to stay for few days, good location and friendly staff I typically do a bit more research before booking a hotel but the rate was decent and we were only needing to stay one night before heading back home from the San Diego area. The room appeared as if there has been an attempt to update it at some point but I didn't look like the work had been professionally done. She also was friendly and did not snark back at us. Upon returning to our room after dinner, we were confronted by our next door neighbor who appeared to be “cleaning” her room and she had the entire contents of her room outside her room and down the walkway. The pounding from their kids feet made me search for a better app. There was 2 double beds and a fold out couch. Should have lights on motion sensors, conserves energy and let's guests sleep. Very good location, near a lot of shopping and restaurants. I know that they have lower rates but that doesn't mean their cleanliness standards should be low. The outside of the hotel was very clean and impressive. The staff was nice, but couldn't do anything about the added fees and no breakfast. There were light stains on our bed sheets and finger prints on the head board. Very slow staff and expected more for the amount of money they charge We chose this hotel based on previous experiences at Wyndham properties. It was just not a safe place to be when traveling alone! My room was on the ground floor next to the stair well where a homeless person was sleeping when I arrived during the evening. Both of us being serviced by a different hostesses behind the counter, but right next to each other. I will never stay here again and recommend you find somewhere else to stay as well. Have stayed here in the past and will stay here again. You get to download white noise apps to drown out those conversations once you feel you have learned too much. I had to paid for parking and hotel wifi didn't work. Sofa bed was just springs and so that person couldn’t sleep at all - certainly not good enough for that price. There is a fantastic BBQ place across the street and the hotel is very close to SeaWorld, airport and many popular sites. We asked for a roll away instead and the brought us a baby crib! Th daily parking fee was decreased at check in but at check out the discount was not applied. We had to go to the lobby to use the restroom. If you must stay here may I recommend some Lysol disinfecting spray and if you take snacks please secure them. I searched for a hotel with breakfast included, the fine print says breakfast at a fee... they did not have a restaurant on site, it was closed and they did not offer any free breakfast. No continental breakfast because their restaurant is closed and not actively being renovated even though they say that it is. The location was fantastic if you plan on going to SeaWorld or the San Diego Zoo. Unanswered requests for the staff 1) to vacuum under the pullout couch and 2) to provide extra towels. We checked in and checked out within 1 hour and they still charged me a day. I asked her why the customer next to me only had to pay $7 and me $10. I was 4th in line and there were 4 families behind me. These 2 things cost me much more than if I would of just stayed someplace else! The beds, towels and linens were perfect, but there was sand on the sofa and the room smelled musty. Conference and meeting facilities also make it a great place to host business events, banquets or social functions. But for the price and location the place is nice. Room for four only stocked enough towels for three, had to leave a note for housekeeping. All those kids were taking up all the parking spaces for the hotel parking forctge people actually staying there. Dead palms were falling from the trees and nearly hit one of my children. The lady servicing me said she would discount to $10. I had to pay 12 dollars a day for parking which I think is ridiculous. Had I arrived on vacation to San Diego and found myself at this Wyndham location I would be extremely disappointed. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that issue. 14.00 parking fee and 50.00 per night deposit over and above the nightly fee, not disclosed in the hotels.com details. I booked my flight before knowing this and had to uber to the hotel, but it wasn't very pricey. The Wyndham Garden San Diego offers family-friendly accommodations just minutes from Sea World and the San Diego airport. I have never written a public complaint about a hotel, so clearly this place must be pretty bad. I called 5 times each time I got told it had been escalated or no status change. Hotel was located in a good spot for our activities, but a lot of homeless people around. They charged 14.00 a night for parking, which is also in the VERY FINE print. The staff was friendly but that doesn't make the quality of the rooms any better. I chose the family suite with a king bed based on the photo on Expedia. This place needs some MAJOR updating to come up to par. However, the beds were uncomfortable, the carpet smells funky/moldy, and if you request for more towels, be prepared to pick it up yourself. The internet was down in building C my entire stay. When we checked out we told the woman at the front desk of our findings. The lobby was breezy and fresh, and the staff was exceptionally nice and friendly! we asked them when we saw them when they would come, they said 4pm and 4 pm came and nobody arrived. When we were ready to leave I was told I had to come to the lobby to check out even though I had no extra charges where I had to wait 15 minutes to talk to someone to checkout of the room. The restaurant was closed for remodeling, which was not mentioned on the website. This is more like a Motel 6 with the Wyndham name on it. We go there often as am a cancer patient in Mex. I would not recommend this place to anyone especially traveling with children. I was NEVER able to connect to the internet on my phone or laptop the entire 7 days I stayed. Upon awakening in the morning we found moisture dripping down the walls, dripping down the door frame and dripping down the mounted wall fixtures. The lady at the front desk told us the gate to the premises would be closed and a key was needed to drive through to park, however, our whole stay the gate remained open and it was slightly unsettling as homeless stood on the opposite side of the streets. Expected this to be more like a Hilton or Marriott Hotel. Our room had a mildew smell that wouldn’t go away. The room was a nice size, but a little out-dated. The bed cover's looked stained to me but my husband said it was part of the print. Then the kids were making noise all night  in groups. Yes, this cheap, I should have read the reviews in more detail, but thought Wyndham had good, proud brands. The hotel is less than five minutes from Sea World San Diego and the Valley View Casino Center. If you think you are booking a night at a Wyndham, you're not. Tons Of kids using the parking atvtge hotel for a party at the sports arena. I would NOT recommend and I will NEVER stay at a Wyndham again. Terrible experience stsff not freindly n security dude is creepy just stares at u thiught it was Lerch. Staff was great but had to handle too many inconveniences! The hotel provided the experience I was expecting: friendly staff, clean room, and a reasonable price. If I had booked it for more nights, I would have canceled. The management has replied to previous posts about cockroaches saying they sprayed and it is now taken care of. Seaworld is in the title (technically near Seaworld)  however the area had no family friendliness to it. The room I thought we were getting appeared to have a separate sleeping area (photo shows a white door) The room we got only had a small, step type dividing wall. On the other hand the staff of the hotel was excellent. The hotel is very clean, friendly staff, waking distance to many places to eat. Rooms are clean and several restaurants, a grocery store, and a casino within walking distance. The Wyndham Garden San Diego has an outdoor heated pool, a game room and a playground for guests to enjoy. The room had some neat features such as a separate room with an extra TV and a sofa. Writing this as I am sitting in the worst place I have ever stayed. I travel alot and this is the first hotel that made the kids feel important. Meaning the front desk admitted to me.of only having one house keeping maid for the 4, 3 story buildings. very nice hotel will definitiy return again, the location and price was really nice. I realize this is California and some businesses use this antiquated marketing technique so they can attract customers to the lower room rate; to me it’s price manipulation. We had to dispose of ours when we found the cockroaches feasting on them. Stayed 1 night and decided to leave the next leaving one day early and they decide now they will charge me for all three nights. Only half hour drive to La Jolla Crove and other sight seeing places . She pft and said she would discount to $7 “even though they are not supposed to”. Even when I left a note asking for more the next day what I was left were two partially used containers of lotion obviously from other people's rooms. The hotel was ok just wore out bed,furniture and the bathroom was just like grandmas house old. But a 15 dollar parking fee, that's a little crazy. The mattress on the fold out was all old springs and not useable! It was the worst stay in my hotel history for San Diego. For the price I paid, I think I could have found something better. room entry door loose had to call front desk to fix and did not succeed, a hotel for $180 a night not up to par I have seen better hotels for $50 a night i would not recommend  this place at all and i am not going back i dont know how travelocity would even have anything to do with wyndham company hotel The neighborhood is somewhat downscale but is within walking distance of at least two shopping centers and is close to Seaworld. Slamming doors and talking all night in the balconies the hotel security did nothing. Yes, people are nice at check-in, but when you call to ask to get out of this place or be moved to another location or renovated room, their tune changes. The entire hotel is severely rundown and in need of major renovations. We struggled to find more than one outlet that we could plug our various chargers into without the plug falling out of the outlet. I just thought with that name it would be a lot nicer! You will know when your neighbours above need to go the bathroom in the middle of night to ensure they are ok. For the most part the staff was nice, but one of the days our room was only 1/2 cleaned and the towels left by the door and no new toiletries or cups. Loud from street and airplane noise, but also very thin walls. There were a lot of adult only stores nearby with store advertisements and window displays that made the area very uncomfortable to drive in with my children - not an area I would ever bring my family back to - not the hotels fault but something that I feel very strongly families should know before selecting this hotel and area in general. When walking around the room barefoot it felt like the carpet was wet. very good service , got an upgrade when I checked in and also checked out at 5-30 am , good big room close to restaurants and shops , bar and restaurant was closed however but plenty close by within walking distance . I arrived later and the other guest with me arrived first. the beds were very comfortable, though walls are a little thin. You had to hold it in your hand and water yourself and the water will spill outside. I actually had to email a copy of my id and credit card before they would let them check in. Jad to call front desk 3 tome to get towels not to mention that the room phone didnt work. The area is rough and the hotel is old and run down. Way too overpriced for condition of room, and lack of included amenities. I was checking in at the same time as another person. The wifi did not work at all (supposedly they are changing providers) and the hotel is infested with cockroaches. The hotel was tired and the pictures did not accurately reflect the room conditions. The lighting outside the room was so bright it made it really hard to sleep. The receptionist did not make a room request an option. The beds were uncomfortable and the comforters were stained on both the queen beds. I been eaiting for travelocity to contact me n they still havent. Good room for the price, lots of walkable resteraunts and a 10 min drive to sea world. I their defence, they DID allow us to check in a few hours early and perhaps the cleaning staff was interrupted? The only problem I found is if your room is in the corner of the building you may experience traffic noise. Had to call police, charged for damages in someone elses room The elevator in the building we were in was gross. I should of paid a little more for a hotel that includes everything up front! I expect transparency and a flat rate per night to stay. The room did not even have a comfortable chair to sit in. It is my understanding that Wyndham recently acquired this property and is in the process of upgrading. The hotel is spread over a large area and we actually had to leave the property and enter from another street to get to our room. The cleaning staff did not come clean the second day. The hotels exterior is a bit hidden by local businesses, but warm and inviting with trees and plants. The hotel is a little bit dated, but generally not a bad value. Also keep in mind the shuttle to the airport is only available 9am-9pm. The room was a good size with a seperate living room with sofa bed. Staff was nice enough to get the right bed but that was after our keys became demagnetized and had to be replaced! When we arrived there was one person attending the front desk, with a line that reached the door. We wanted a king size bed but opted to keep our 2-queen bed room because there was so many disgruntled guests already. I found our room very stuffie / humid , poor air circulation, including small pillows not the average norm size
The sauna has a view over the zoo, and is worth a visit. When I pointed out that the hotel advertised a fitness center (there is actually a picture of one in the orbitz photos of the hotel) and that we should be refunded the 10 euros x 2 people x 3 days, the staff was rude and apathetic. Bathroom open to the room is a bit strange but makes it feel more open. This is where I'll be staying in Berlin from now on. I found this unforgivable as water is a basic necessity surely. Proximity to the zoo and views of same, from the hammock in one's room, make for a memorable, relaxed experience. Every night we enjoyed pleasant zoo sounds of birds, elephants and I swear we heard a lion roar. Great recommendation from reception was berlinfoodstories.com for 5 great restaurants in every category. Only thing I'd prefer is a little more light in the rooms. A really great hotel that's situated perfectly for public transport or walking to interesting places. Do not miss the incredible and bountiful breakfast with sweeping views. We did breakfast on some days only, but it was really worth it, delicious spread. Furthermore, although a few of the front office staff were very cordial and helpful there were others who were rude, abrupt, and literally started laughing as I walked way after explaining the situation with the fitness center! The breakfast however was lovely and probably the best part of the stay. We ate in the restaurant on our second night and were sorely disappointed. Our mains came some time after we asked where the were. I took my boyfriend for his 30 birthday and prior to arriving I contacted the hotel to request a room with a hammock. The views from the monkey bar and restaurant are simpl superb and the location of the hotel is perfect. Also my room had a hammock (as well as a bed)!! They kept asking me to come back and see the manager who was never around (a hotel truly deserving of an exceptional rating would have left a message on our room phone). ,i went to the very comfortable bakery for a coffee when  granddaughter used shower . We stayed at this hotel from Jul 31 through Aug 3. Couldn’t see a thing and certainly couldn’t read in bed as it was so dark with no directional light. In fact, the hotel did not have an in house fitness center. The problems was, that we were trying to find a hotel with a fitness center. While the mezze starter was ok, it was very filling so the main was only picked at. Boasting glorious views of Berlin's popular Kufürstendamm shopping street area, Zoo and Tiergarten, the trendy 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin sits invitingly at just a six-minute walk from the  Zoologischer Garten metro station. Better than expected, cool casual hotel, with an excellent location. Wine ok not a big selection, seating is a little uncomfortable and place very noisy but to be fair its mainly a young persons bar, had very tasty fries. The Monkey Bar upstairs is popular almost all day, everyday. No toiletries apart from large bottles of inadequate liquid soap (that didn’t lather!) Was with my grandaughter we did not find the open shower a problem there is a modesty curtain. I don't usually write reviews but our stay at this hotel was incredible. Didn’t bother with the TV but it was at the bottom of the bed facing away?! The room wasn’t completely ready when we arrived, however these issues were dealt with quickly and by a brilliant technician. Only complaints, pillows were uncomfortable and shower floor was really slippery. Second stay but this time higher up and as a result noise from the bar disco upstairs was booming though the ceiling. Thank you for the great stay 25 Hours, we will be back for sure. nice view of zoo but could only see a few birds. 25 Hours Bikini was easily the most unique hotel we have ever stayed at. The hotel has a quirky laid-back way about it, but still stylish. At your doorstep (literally) is some unique 'open-mall style' shopping with German brands, restaurants, coffee shops, cafe's - pretty much everything you need. We also visited the 'Bakery' in the reception area everyday which sold sandwiches cakes hot drinks and alcohol with views of the zoo from your hammock! There is free Wi-Fi throughout, and guests enjoy a discount from the adjacent public parking lot. Guests may snack of freshly baked goods from the Woodfire Bakery, and relax with drinks in the Monkey Bar, enjoying city views from the rooftop terrace. We’ve stayed in many hotels in the past four years and 25hours Hotel Bikini is by far our favorite! Going for the studio was definitely worth it, well thought out space - loved the shower and bath. Select rooms additionally feature separate living rooms, and floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic city views that guests may enjoy from a hammock. We took half an hour just to find it- and the hotel charged 10 euros per person. I realise most Germans don’t take milk with 5heir tea but plenty of tourists do. The hotel has awesome bikes to rent and a perfect little bakery for quick coffee and snacks. Chic, urban air-conditioned and en-suite rooms feature flat-screen TVs and iPod docks. We went in the monkey bar and had a few drinks,my cocktail was watery and tasteless not worth thd 12.5 euros. The hotel is attached to a fab mall with shopping and eateries....well worth a visit! The room is super cool and fun, shame that we didn't get the zoo side, but the city view was still amazing. Only downsides were the very dim but cool lighting and aircon wasn't great. I wouldn’t stay 5here again unless they resolved the issues we had The hotel is perfectly situated at the heart of the city, its right next to a shopping mall, close to many great spots and 5 mins walk from a major transit station. Super friendly, patient and knowledgable staff is available 24 hours. On the plus side, the hotel is very stylish with a edgy modern feel with unique in-room features such as a hammock and a great location near the Berlin zoo. A hotel that has a fitness center has one that is in house and included in the room rate. Situated in a busy retail part of the city with a lovely view of the Zoo on one side of the hotel and the church and shopping area on the other side. They followed through with my request and couldn't be more accommodating. We love the smart contemporary design, lively atmosphere, the beautiful rooftop restaurant with incredible 360º views of Berlin, and most of all, the bright, tranquil rooms with floor to ceiling glass supplying uninterrupted views of the zoo, Tiergarten and Berlin. Popular attractions include the Potsdamer Platz, the Brandenburg Gate, and the Memorial Church on Breidscheidtplatz.z We love this hotel, the room, the service, the views, and the restaurant. Language wasn’t the issue as we were there with my Fluent German speaking aunt and uncle. Stopped eventually but stay lower down and then not Audible My room had an extra platform lounging bed which was nice to have. This was the perfect stay for my sister’s 40th birthday!! We sent half full plates back as did several tables. Rental bicycles are available, which may be included in the room price. It had a partnership arrangement with with a gym that was four blocks away, tucked into some kind of shopping mall in a corner. We’ve stayed here three years in a row and we can’t say enough. Guests may work out in the associated fitness centre, and relax in the sauna.
Nestled between the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysées in the beautiful city of Paris, Kleber Tour Eiffel Champs Elysées serves as a home away from home. Walk 3 block to cham-elysee and have awesome breakfast 25€ for 2 people. Furthermore, a library and two meeting rooms are also found on-site. Our room was always clean and the bed was super comfortable as well. No outlet for your electronics and they dont have adapters try finding a store that has one for sale in that neighborhood is nearly impossible. From Kleber Tour Eiffel Champs Elysées, the Kleber Metro Station is a two-minute walk away. Rooms look nothing like the photos - small, cheaply furnished, and the bathroom was really dirty. The hotel features a business centre and a parking area, which are open for 24-hours each day. I went down to lobby was lucky that the lady now speaks english and she said  the man in charge of maintenance is not here now tomorrow 8 am ill send him up nobody showed. Typical Parisian hotel, my room was tiny but others looked bigger Breakfast not worth 20€ pp, no choices , cold coffee and nasty attitude from server. Everything was great, the only problem was the dust under the bed. We had a roll out bed and when we took the roll out of the bed, under the bed was totally covered in dust. Hotel Kleber is a small but friendly hotel perfectly situated. Excellent location very close to arc de triumph and champs elysee..metro stations close by..needs a bit upgrading..there was a few confusion with the staff we believed we booked with breakfast and they made us pay againand try to make it up to use by upgradingbour roomywo nights before checkout good shower and bathroom, heating worked very well, and the price was very reasonable. This location is not noisy, just off the path from the hustle and bustle of the city. Was going to put away my valubles ( safe doesnt work). Will definitely remember this place for my next Paris trip. Even though I showed them the reservation from hotels.com I couldnt win so I just went ahead and told them to charge my card. Other dining options outside the hotel include Akrame, Restaurant Victor, and Restaurant Le M64. This was a good hotel which is walking distance to several tourist attractions including Arc de Triumph (10 minute walk) and Eiffel Tower (15-20 minute walk). full of charm (the good kind), very clean and comfortable. Rooms were small though, however, this is expected in a small hotel like this one. We ended up leaving one of our credit cards in the cabinet, the staff called us and then mailed it to us in the states. This hotel is a well appointed hotel at reasonable prices -  It is a great base for any trip to Paris and close to the tube line. Also, the hotel had a old style to it which made it quaint and lovely. Got dressed went let them again they said will send sombody up never did. Each room is equipped with a minibar, and a television with satellite channels. We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Paris. Came back maintenance guy went up fixed safe but not tub. I have more...but let me tell you the outcome of the tub first. The large windows and wooden floors give an airy atmosphere. The Cocktail Bar serves refreshing beverages in a cosy setting. Although bathroom was a little moldy and our safe did not work (even though we notified staff numerous times). Went up to room hopeing to talk a nice bath ( hot tub doesnt work) and this is because they are charging me extra for the tub. First they couldn't find my reservation after 10 min of searching they found it , than to my surprise they said that they rate would be more.
We stayed there for 3 nights and the shower was fixed on the last day we were there : ( The credit card I gave to the hotel for incidentals was charged and the credit card my husband used to actually pay for everything was also charged. Of course the hotel is beautiful and historic, the location is  great , the food tasty, the room well-maintained and cozy. The staff was very professional and the hotel is well maintained. Highly recommend it, and if possible have a great meal at the rib room. I would recommend the room with doors onto a balcony. The hotel is in a great location and is beautiful with an incredibly friendly staff. The only thing that let this hotel down was the room being serviced. The location is fantastic and close to everything in the French quarter. However, the location is convenient for most places and excellent restaurants. We traveled with another couple who paid the same rate as us but they had there room serviced twice a day got chocolates every night and a morning newspaper daily. La Riviera and Touché Bar serve cocktails and food in casual, comfortable settings. And we had the best time watching the Easter Day parade start out from right outside the door. Next time in No we will def stay at this same hotel! The bathroom was not all that clean, but everything else was great. Very close to Bourbon St. but just enough off the beaten path to get away from it. Staff was very attentive however, our rooms were not ready at check in time as promised. We had to call maintenance twice before we got him to fix the cold showers. For sure the bar and restaurant are worth the benefit on site! It's sill the friendly service that will call me back. It is located within a block of Bourbon St and only a couple of blocks from the riverside and uptown. Would have been nice to have a little more counter space in the bathroom Staff was amazing and really helpful from the moment we arrived. We spent almost $800 on the room and didn’t get any type of refund on our room. They allow you to keep your dog in the room while you walk around town (not all hotels do in New Orleans- many say they allow dogs but you can't leave dog in room-be aware) Not too happy with that, but not a deal breaker. Close to Bourbon Street, this hotel features a rooftop pool and fitness center with views overlooking the town. There is a daily parking fee for nearly 50 dollars a day. Crowded for two people in a guestroom with one queen bed. The roof top bar and swimming pool are a great place to hang out. The hotel is perfectly located and the food was very good. The pool on the 7th floor has wonderful views and is a great facility. Jessica, at the front desk helped us print out our boarding passes. It was so convenient to go out shopping and then pop back to the hotel to drop off bags. We went up on the observation deck (out by the pool) Saturday morning and listened to the Natchez Boat play the pipe organ! I probably will not return to New Orleans but definitely do recommend this facility if you plan a trip there!! Cold air blew from a vent and made it very uncomfortable to sleep, but on the plus side it was not musty! It would have been nice to have a room with a view, but that’s not a factor in the review. Micro beer seen is growing a lot of good beer inN,O, The positive thing about the stay was I was really close to everything in the French Quarter. I was here with my grandsons and we had a wonderful time. We spent a lot of money on this room and did not get a discount or a refund. We did get the parking comped, but that had nothing to do with my room stay. The guestroom and the bathroom, however, although nice, were very small. Enjoyed the visit and will be back for the 5th time! I was able to take the St Charles streetcar to the Garden District and the Canal streetcar to the park and NOMA. Hot coffee was spilled on me one of the mornings we had breakfast, they apologized, but I really felt that the service was really poor. The French Market is 0.5 miles away and Mercedes-Benz Superdome is 1.3 miles away. It's beautiful and close enough to everything so you don't need a car. The staff was very helpful and always on-hand to assist us. This is a terrible place - scammed our credit card for over $1000 AUD tried to get them to reverse fraudulent charges on account they did nothing WARNING DO NOT STAY HERE We had brunch in the rib room which was nice. We had a nice 2 night stay here in Christmas day. About $157 for incidental fee charged to your card at check in. This accommodation is also known as Hotel Omni Royal, Hotel Royal Orleans, Omni Hotel Orleans, and Omni Orleans Royal. So if you're not concerned about sleeping while in NOLA, then this hotel would be perfect. Iris assured me that I will have a balcony room, Of course I did not and it sucked,being in the room the whole time you are on vacation, I should have called the hotel myself i could have did a better job Even though the hotel is in the heart of the French Quarter, it's tucked away in a more upscale, quieter area. Within walking distance to all around the French Quarter and Riverwalk. The room was a bit small, but we didn't go to Nola to spend time in a hotel room,so I'm not complaining. The incidental charge is refunded if there are no incidents or damages, etc. Each guestroom features a private bathroom with free toiletries, flat screen TV with cable channels and on-demand movies, coffee and tea making facilities, and air conditioning. Very nice to have staff that actually cares about your issues and works hard to resolve them. Room was very small and no city view (like it said on the site). World War 2 museum excellent also check out the pharmacy museum off St Louis street 1pm tour is very good. The hotel is beautiful, staff is always friendly, and the location is ideal. The concierge gave us a huge variety of great restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner within a stone's throw of the lobby. If you get a chance, don't hesitate to book at this hotel. When we checked out we found someone had a car listed under our name and room number and that they had charge us for parking. My favorite aspect of this hotel was the rooftop terrace. Brennan's, Cafe du Monde, Court of 2 Sisters, Central Grocery, etc. My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The WiFi is not free, and the room is very very intense. The hotel  location is ideal, and the staff goes above and beyond. We loved having coffee on our balcony in the mornings. The only problem was we reserved a king room for five days well in advance of our stay. Hotel staff was nothing short of amazing and right in the heart of the French Quarters ! Centrally located, not noisy at night (even though it’s in the quarter), great staff, immediate help... what more can you ask for? Our room was a little smaller than we are accustom to, but the shower was awesome! Great location and love the overlook on the roof top Although a nice hotel, we experienced someone on our floor multiple nights smoking marijuana. We were told that they would not be able to put us in a king room until our second day but they did give us a hotel credit and other amenities. We stayed one night at the Riverside omni and 6 nights here . 1) One of the elevators shakes while moving  2) our bathroom door knob falls off 3) Worst, the down comforter on one of the beds was molded. Check in was over an hour late, room not as nice as described. They have an Easter party/ hat contest, egg hunt for kids right at the Omni. They take pride in making your stay enjoyable and memorable. Well located in the heart of the French Quarter but far enough away from the noise and distractions of Bourbon Street; a true oasis. Attention to all my foodies, there is a fine dining restaurant on the ground level for your enjoyment. This hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of the French Quarters. We were able to walk around and shop in the many shops in the French Quarter. 20 dollars a day for pool pass if you want to swim. This hotel is quiet and in a good French quarter location. Omni Royal Orleans offers a 24-hour business center as well as 24-hour reception. I love the staff, Rib Room, location, views, and safety of this property. I would definitely stay here again, but maybe request a room with a bigger bathroom. We booked a standard queen room, not knowing we would get a miniature-sized petite room - Barely enough space for 2 people to walk around, with no dresser or bathroom counter space at all. Jazz band came to our table and played a song which was nice. We loved this hotel and have stayed at several hotels in the French Quarter and this one did not disappoint. The bellmen and cleaning staff were great.I asked for a wake up call and did not get it on the day of checkout, but the alarm clock was reliable. Concierge services are available to assist with booking tours or providing information about the local area. Second time at this hotel all staff are so personable and welcoming and love that it is dog friendly The Staff greets you each and every time with sincere interest, not fake concern. You are literally on the same street as JAckson Square and a block from Bourbon. This was the perfect location to experience the French Quarter. It’s a beautiful building, but the hotel itself needs a few improvements. We had our room done maybe once a day and not very well and no extras. Early check in, upgrade, awesome front desk and managers, great audio/visual people and management was impeccable too. Not sure how this happened but they reversed the charges so that was good. There are a lot of great things about the famous Royal Orleans (Listen to Led Zeppelin song of same name). The hotel is very nice and located just a block from Bourbon Street but is quiet. Rib Room is the hotel’s award-winning restaurant, serving meat and fish dishes infused with local flavors. I assume it’s costly everywhere in that area though, but it’s worth it if you’re looking for proximity to the great shops and restaurants of the French Quarter. Lucinda was amazing and helped us find the best locations! However, every time a door opens or closes, or every time someone talks in the hallway, or every time the housekeeping staff say housekeeping anywhere near your room, or every time the people in the next room get loud it is like they are in the room with you. Located in the heart of the French Quarter, it is close to everything we wanted to do. Hopefully they will improve done of there cleaning staff everything including there staff was great but we all like a place to be clean! The only downside of this hotel was the cost of valet parking. It took a long time for them to bring us our order (at least 45 mins). This was our third time at an omni hotel and they have always been excellent . The hotel is beautiful (just decorated for Christmas) rooms are clean, beds very comfortable for a great nights sleep! The hotel itself is beautiful however it is an older hotel with small rooms and bathrooms. A lot louder than I thought it would be but staff was very attentive and property was clean When I recieved the crab salad I ordered I found it to very bland and it was missing some of the ingredients listed on the menu. We got what had to be THE smallest room there and with a courtyard view of paint cans, complete with early morning construction workers talking right outside our window. Our room was good but the sheets were dirty which disappointed us. But on this trip we got the worst room in the whole place. Room got cleaned late, bathroom was kind of small, and no view The staff went out of their way to accommodate my needs; including bringing in a fridge and coordinating multiple reservations. Some rooms have views of St. Louis or Royal Street. Pool is on the roof, small but view is awesome. Omni Royal Orleans offers 4-star accommodations in the heart of the vibrant French Quarter. My husband enjoyed his omelet though and the unlimited mimosas was great. This is the first time we have ever put on negative feed back on a hotel. It was in a perfect location, only blocks from Jackson square. Far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon street so the room is quiet. EVERY staff person was friendly and accommodating, it just made for a great day from beginning to end. Rooms were very small, but hey, it's an old and haunted hotel. The hotel is perfectly situated and although right in the heart of the French Quarter, it is quiet. It was in a great location and our balcony was awesome. Renee and Mary in the Rib Room provided excellent services and the Turn Down Service was so nice to come back to and the room cleanliness was great!
Most of all I appreciated the attentive and nice personal of the Modern Hotel. I would improved breakfast, because sometimes there weren't things and if I'm paying for a breakfast, there should be even the basic things like orange juice Only issue was the rooms did not have any air conditioning and we had to open the window at night which opened right on the busy road. Although the size of the bedroom was ok, it smelled bad from the first to the last day, and on the three days of staying, our sheets haven’t been changed even once. However, it had a distinct smell which made us feel dizzy, so that we had to change the air all the time. Nice hotel and nice place to stay ..People was kindly.. This smell was all the time in the room and was littlebit disturbing. Very bad customer services, dirty room, hot inside, very small. The price is normal and the hotel is worth it. Around the hotel you can find many restaurant chains, however we preferred eating elsewhere in paris. just the staff at the reception could be more courteous and friendly. The location is very good near the station of Metropoliten and bus stations Besides that the location of the hotel was great because there was easy excess to transport. very convenient location hotel very clean and comfortable  and with spacious bedroom  but not much natural light  in rear bedrooms,i would have prefferd a room with a view at the front of hotel, continental breakfast was sufficient  and  offers value for  money,  would stay again and can recommend staff friendly and helpful. The receptionist never gave us a receipt about our payment for the stay. A very friendly & helpful staff, Great Location, Clean rooms :) I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel, but equipping the rooms with a minibar will be a great deal. Location is great - close to city center and  transportation hubs. The bathroom was small, new and clean with a tub and a dryer. It is a friendly hotel in a nice neighbourhood of  Paris I was on vacation, so that's okay, but if I had to work it would have been a bit difficult. Had to have windows open all the time and that gave a lot of noise from the streets. Good hotel for a short stay in a central place for a good price. Aside from the complimentary breakfast, which includes juices, cereals and a baguettes the hotel is surrounded by top-rated cafes and restaurants for classic French cuisine and live music. - Friendly personnel - Very good located near Metro - Reception available 24 hours. So clean, very convevient location, excellent guys at the reception . This was an absolutely pleasant stay, we had no high expectations going in, especially with a 1 and half year old baby. Had what we needed for the time we were there. Will try to book The Modern for our next time in Paris. I was suprised by the cleaniness of the rooms and the perfect location to explore the city. You should not rent rooms 01 and 02 on the ground floor. PS: Don't ask for a minimum amount of characters and not show how many are missing, it's going to kill your reviews because the people will be frustrated and just ramble till they get it or even worse, close the window and never send you the data. With full windows and ensuite bathrooms basic travel necessities are provided such as, hairdryer, bath, shower, toiletries and television. The hotes is on stage of renovation, the rooms we stayed were on the 4th floor, brand new. Elevator made me nervous  Room was beautiful  Wished we could have warm breads at breakfast In addition when I poured the hot water, at first coffee came out, a bad indication of how well the thermos is cleaned daily... Not a big room nor a big bad but honest cost x benefit I recommend, it is located in an area from which you have easy access to visit the whole of Paris. It felt like we were the first people to ever stay in the room. Very good price / qualitys, excellent location, very friendly staff. A kettle in the room would have been very welcome. The quality/price ratio (rooms, location, service) is also at a high level. Hotel was clean, comfortable and Thomas on the front desk was very friendly and helpful. The hotel gave us a large room (room 506) that has a small kitchen-like area (came in handy when preparing baby food), the hotel gave us a baby crib as requested by phone, that gave our little one a good night of sleep. Tiny small rooms (bed and table) but very clean and location is perfect. But, If I visit Paris again, I will stay in this hotel regarding to the price and it's location. When I arrived I was offered a map of the city which was very useful, thanks for that. Perhaps the few problems with our stay came with child proofing of some of the windows, the (60cm) hight was too low for our jumpy baby. The area is perfect just the bulding is falling apart We stayed in there for 3 nights, when just arrived we didn't expect what we saw, they use a lot of photoshop on their pictures, is a small room, with a dirty carpet all along the room, not a whole illumination, a mini small shower that is covered in fongus in some areas ugh, you have to almost jump to get to the shower and everytime we use it, it was a mess cause a lot of water flow thru the door panels, I choose this hotel from another one thinking this was better cause it was a 100 more for the 3 nights, if you can stay away from here do it. The internet only worked for 50 percent of the time .being vegan I did not mark the restaurant a high score at all. The room was clean and fine as the bathroom too. There was mould in the shower, but I myself know how hard it is to get rid off it and I don't mind it if I live there only for a couple of days. Everything was great, exept the bathroom was a little bit cold. There were signs saying that if you ate or drank in the room you would be fined  250 euros , the elevator was tiny and can basically fit one person and luggage , also we had to pay a city tax for each day we stayed that was not mentioned online - on the plus side  Staff were friendly  the location was good , rooms were clean , the shower was good  and room was a fair size with windows that opened The rest of the bathroom was quite cramped, though - someone with long legs might not even be able to close the door while sitting on the toilet. Rooms would be better in a little bit wider and also adding English tv channels will be great in order to make people who speak English have the ability to watch TV. not too bad if you you wanna stay for a night or two. Bit noisy due to the bars around the corner but staff friendly and close to metro station and Montmartre. Court séjour mais très agréable  Chambre refaite à neuf et double vitrage  Emplacement idéal The neighborhood is not for children because Pigalle is the zone with sex shops and lap dance club, but is really quiet at night and there are a lot of nice restaurant and bar. It was the cleanest hotel we have stayed at in a long time, the room was very big, and the staff was very friendly. Only negative is hot in the nights with no air con. Only staff could be more pleasant and helpful + instable wifi connexion.... but overall great hotel Big concern is rooms need to have ceiling fans if not air conditioner. The other thing is that in the luggage room downstairs the floor is not in level with the rest of the hotel, it's like a full step lower, and with the really heavy door it is very dangerous, and I would highly recommend for them to put a sign to notify people of the extra step before anybody gets hurt. The room was clean and comfortable, and the hot water was so cool, but the Wi-Fi was a little slow. nice room clean and calm i spend 2 night in this hotel and i wich come next time This hotel is very good hotel such as price and location. It was a cozy hotel and both me and my friend liked it a lot and we will probably come back! There is 24-hour front desk service and public parking available nearby. Newly refurbished and spotless room on the 4th floor with a little balcony and a view on the corner of Boulevard Clichy. Because the rooms were very hot and the air quality was quite bad. People from the reception spoke english and they were friendly and easy to talk to. However there are 2 things that still need your attention. Would reccomend as very cheap  price for short stay. Nous avons passé un bon séjour,  merci à toute l'équipe. All is correct, the room is very good and very clean, the restaurant is medium. Most of all I liked that the shower and toilet are so clean. ) We we amazed at how much nicer it was then it looks on the internet. Just steps from the Place de Clichy train station, guests staying at Modern Montmartre can walk to Le Boucan, the Moulin Rouge, Opera and several department stores. The five floor hotel offers single, double and triple hotel rooms. A friendly clean hotel in a very good area in order to visit the major sites of Paris. After seeing the room I asked here for a better room. The breakfast was the same every day, jam, honey and butter with baguette or croissant, they should involve at least some cheese or salami or something because quite honestly a lot of us hates both jam and honey and may find eating buttered baguette for two weeks a bit of a bummer. I have already filled-in a feed back form-very annoying to receive several! Very pleasant hotel in a picturesque region with a beautiful structure for the ... The information provided with regard to taking a pre-authorisation charge from your account before you arrive is also not very clear. The most important one is the ventilation, aircondition or at least some sort of ventilation and a ceiling fan would make the hotel perfect. Great loaction, the rooms are brand new, were cleaned every day. From stuff in the hotel, room, breakfast, it was perfectly clean, have wifi in rooms. Smell of paint during early mornings when guests still sleeping. The size of the business offer the same essential needs that a big north american chain offers I ask you to give an explanation about the write-off of 5 euros from my account on July 9 at 16:19 after my departure. In the end, they catered to all our wishes and I'm very thankful for that! The Wifi needed a new password every night and it didn't always work. Perfect location(close to metro station, shops and restaurants) ,  nice and clean room. Breakfast: bread of bad quality (hard), I had to ask for plates, yogurts, etc, on the last day a different person prepared breakfast and put hot water in a thermos that had contained coffee, consequently my tea tasted like coffee, pretty disgusting. The location is perfect, near to everywhere and many restaurants open until late at night. Very good location but rehabilitation work has spoiled the impression The staff could have been more friendly, but I guess it's just part of the French mentality. First of all, no air conditioning which is misleading in the hotel room details! Helpful and friendly staff, excellent location with good connections to every direction. A Nice, clean and comfortable hotel with spacious rooms and good showering facilities. Goed gelegen en gemakkelijk bereikbaar hotel in een zijstraat,kamers zijn gerenoveerd .Ontbijt is zeer  simpel maar dat was ons op voorhand verteld.Je krijgt waarvoor je betaald .Vriendelijke bediening. Given that venue was being renovated at the time of our stay this caused some diffulty in moving about running into workers. Nice hotel, great location, friendly staff, close to the metro Breakfast could offer wider variaty for example eggs, cold cuts, cheese, tomato, cucumber etc. We didn't know they we're rebuilding it would've been nicer if they mentioned that, every morning we couldn't sleep in because of the noise Very heavy doors and very small elevator that r not suitable when moving luggage....no air conditioning...not hot tap water ...no refrigurator...limited breakfast choices The location was perfect for us, close to many landmarks and well connected to the rest of paris with transportation. This place is great, it's basic and the rooms are small and quite close quarters but it's clean, comfortable, the staff are very friendly and the location is excellent (5 min walk to Moulin Rouge, and the Montmarte area is so lovely, 2 min walk to nearest metro station) I would recommend this place if you just want a clean and comfortable and reasonable base in Paris. Modern Montmartre Hotel provides complimentary continental breakfast and an onsite bar and lounge. When we were staying, the hotel is under renovation, our room has been renovated and it is clean, all brand new except the mattress, it is very old, the middle of it was caved in. Tip: we found in our experience that inquiring about services or asking questions in the hotel front desk is best answered by the day shift rather than the night shift. Second thing, larger beds for double rooms, 180cm beds are a minimum in rooms like that. The room was fresh and the bathroom was very good I must say. Although your employee knew I had was a Booking-Genius cliente the offered my room 02. The hotel has major renovations going on which were quite disruptive as they were happening on the floor we were staying on. And the weather was cold but the radiator in the room was not working. Everything was really good, I appreciate the location near to metropolitan and bus station. I picked it because the location was near the Elysee Montmarte where we would be going to a concert, it was cheap, and was near a parking garage. Thank you for the best hotel experience we have had in a long time!! Maybe renovating the stairway and also the elevator could be useful. Only thing that wasn't so pleasant, was somekind of chemistry you use for cleaning the room. Stayed at this hotel om many occassions, room etc have geen redecorated, very nice, will definetly be stayibng there again. Apart from that, the shower was spaceous and clean enough. Located in the eighteenth arrondissement, Modern Montmartre is a budget hotel with direct access to the St Lazare train station, with complimentary breakfast and Wi-Fi. We also had to specifically ask the receptionist to free up the pre-payment money from our bank account that was meant to be freed up at the time when the whole payment is paid. Well located, next to Moulin Rouge and close to 2 metro stations, besides being in a 30’ walk to the Louvre The first night the night shift person in the check in should be more kind Need to fix ur showers,have it closed up so water doesn't run all over the bathroom fall....water was running all over the bathroom. great renewed hotel (2017) modern rooms, nice bed (little hard) breakfast little and poor but GREAT coffee!
Room very small but efficient use of small space hotel itself looks run down staff very helpful. this hotel is within walking distance of old town Key West, very convenient. we were able to use the bathroom in their front office which was helpful. Think the price is OK, should be owed to Key West in general. The architecture is comprised of five conch-style buildings, complete with open porches, a heated splash pool complete with a six foot waterfall in the courtyard. there was a hiccup of not having any water one of the days and the hotel was kind enough to refund us $50 for the inconvenience of not being able to shower or wash our hands in our room. Check in was good, location is great, furniture are very cheap and worn out. I had to take sleeping pills to be able to sleep through the night. Our room was good with a small balcony overlooking the pool, but others seemed cramped with minimum daylight. On the up side - location was good for us, front desk staff at check in was a very nice gentleman. The cleaning staff met minimum standards but kept us guessing on how many towels and washcloths that we would have for any one night. Albury Court Hotel is just an 11-minute walk from Key West Aquarium and a short distance away from the southernmost point of the United States. Excellent location near to port and Easy access to all sights of interest Room cleaned just ok. Breakfast and pool are just 2 ⭐️ ⭐️ Did not like crossing the busy street to get to my room from the office and breakfast. Location was perfect - close by to everything in the heart of Key West. if one is not familiar with Albury Ct Hotel, finding a place to park and register can be a challenge. nice size room typical continental breakfast plunge pool about 10-15 minute walk to Duval St. no on site parking Parking is on street and can be difficult to find. after unloading luggage, i suggest parking in the city garage 2 blocks away. Onlything I can complain about is we wish the vanity was a little bigger in the bathroom no place to really put things,but overall a great place The room was very clean but VERY SMALL.The continental breakfast area is so small it was near impossible to get to.We finally gave up & walked down to the bakery which was very good.A tall man could touch all 4 sides of the pool at once.Parking is very difficult as wel.Hotel is definitley overpriced,the only good thing is the closet....uhhh room,was clean & its a pleasant & easy walk to all Duvall St.has to offer. our room was modern and had a small refrigerator with eco friendly shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. There is no restaurant on-site, however a complimentary continental breakfast is available. The only inconvenience we had was finding a place nearby to park for the night. good hotel, within walking distance to Duval and lots of things, great to have a scooter to get around as it is pretty well located Great tea and water in the lobby.Sheets were rough other than that we definitely enjoyed our stay at this charming Key West hotel Concierge service is also available for guest convenience upon request. We are in our late 60s and like to walk so we walked to all the attractions. Take a few of the lounge chairs from the balconies during the day. The cost of this room did not justify the price, The room, however, was probably the smallest and least accommodating of the five places that we stayed on our trip to Florida and the Carolinas. Great location I loved walking everywhere close enough to duval! we were told by the front desk that we could pull up in front to unload our car before parking but we just parked about one block over (on fleming i think?) Close to restaurants and walkable to Duvall St. Would definitely stay here again! Add is misleading; pool is hot-tub size; room was very small and not that clean. Lazy front desk personnel !There was a female manager that I spoke to on the phone and she was rude ( no customer service). One day we rented bicycles to tour the cemetery and go to the two east and west forts with a stop at the beach. Shutters did not block the lights outside our windows all night, room smelled strongly like bleach but was clean! The location is very good - short walk to Mallory Square and Duval Street. Popular dining options nearby include Blue Heaven and The Cafe. Otherwise, there is a bakery that opens at 7 a.m. just a block down the street that does breakfast sandwiches and sweet rolls. Room was not made one day, i had to tidy it up myself in the evening upon my return from a tour day. they also let us keep our bag in the front office after checking out while we did the Dry Tortugas tour (which is conveniently only 2 short blocks behind this hotel!!!) Rooms have a simple, yet contemporary feel, and come standard with flat screen televisions, minifridges, coffee makers, a safe and free Wi-Fi. This is the ultimate traveler's destination to experience Old Town. There are so many better ones than this place . Could here upstairs guest but generally hotel was pretty quiet. Couple blocks to Duval St, but far enough away to avoid crowds and noise. We will return to this place every time - perfect accommodations, perfect location, & a very reasonable price @ like $140 a night. Had to park and pay at parking garage 2 blocks away Parking was easy to find and free and you can walk to everything. Place was great a little tight in the room but overall was good. Next time I will spend the extra $100 and stay at a resort or even another bread and breakfast! Since the Albury did not serve its Continental breakfast until 8:00, the inability to make a morning cup of coffee was frustrating. We heard another guest complain about the noise on the street side. Room was small, unfortunately ours was right on the street, heard traffic all night. The Albury was convenient and reasonably priced for Key West but lacking in other aspects. I enjoyed my stay.the room room was clean and nice,breakfast was on time and acceptable,coffee was good.The Hotel is close enough to walk to most attractions.Parking is tough to get but that's mostly the way it is everywhere in Key West,next time I'll fly to Key West,taxi to hotel and rent a bike,it's the best way to get around there period.Check in was easy and courteous.Hotel Staff were attentive and efficient. The Albury Court Hotel in Key West is a quaint, boutique style property located just 5 minutes from the harbor. Rooms are noisy one can hear chattering in the next room or people passing by on their way to their room Can't find any parking near hotel and got tickets for parking right next to hotel because they are not clear to tell they don't have any. It was walkable to many restaurants and entertainment, but beaches and some attractions required a car or the convenient Key West Duval Loop bus. Had a great time!breakfast was great, always hit the spot,walking distant to everything! Be aware that we had jewelry taken from the room from the safe!!!!!!! Fun location close to Duval St. with restaurants and shops within a block or two. Room was okay and location was good for the pier area. We were able to return to a comfortable, clean room daily and really enjoyed the grounds. Breakfast was cheesy and one member of the staff was discourteous at that time. The rooms aren't well insulated so the noise of Eaton Street was very disruptive to sleep. Our room was in a great location, A28, overlooking the pool. The outdoor pool is open all year long, as is the beautifully constructed sun deck. The room was smaller, but we are not in Key West to stay in our room! this was one of the cheapest options i could find on key west that also was not a major chain hotel. The biggest inconvenience, though, was the lack of the advertized tea and coffee facilties and AM/FM clock radio, givens at rooms one-third the price. Our room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels, better service than some big name hotels we've stayed in! A nice hotel located close to bars, restaurants and shops. Very nice breakfast, small room, noisy AC, tiny pool, close to town made walking and bikeing easy, parking on only side roads made loading and unloading difficult. It was a very pleasant stay and the rooms felt more like home or a friend's house than a hotel. We were able to walk or ride our bikes to everything. the front desk also gives a map of where to park so that you dont park in a residential spot (although these are marked on the street inside the spot). We liked the room and the bed with so many pillows. we live in brooklyn, ny so looking for a spot and then parallel parking was not a big deal to us, but it may be to others. Location is important,  the Albury is a perfect distance from the madness if Duval! Great breakfast in the morning, very pleasant and knowledgeable staff. The continental breakfast had enough variety that everyone could find something to eat.
My room was okay except I did not enjoy the tv channels. Conveniences comprise a 24-hour reception, Wi-Fi access, free parking, lifts, a beauty salon and conference rooms. There’s also a tea lounge, room service and a poolside bar that serves hot drinks and juices. The room overlooking the pool was decent in size and comfortable. Good experience overall, although you need a cab for pretty much everything. Communal leisure facilities include a sauna, steam room, gym, children’s play area and sun terrace. Reception staff were rude and not friendly and furniture broken in the room A freshly prepared breakfast is available and the hotel restaurant serves traditional local dishes. Good sized room, shuttle bus and lots of taxis at the hotel. The location of th hotel is good with very spacious parking. Mogador Kasbah is roughly four kilometres from the Jemaa el-Fna marketplace, which sits within the city’s World Heritage Site core. She described this hotel as a great value for its cost. Highlights include an outdoor swimming pool, an ornately decorated lobby and a complimentary scheduled shuttle bus to downtown. She recommends that people should look into considering this hotel for their stay on their next Marrakesh trip. Her one week stay was eventless and incident free and the hotel amenities were adequate. A modern resort hotel in beautiful Marrakech, Mogador Kasbah offers upscale accommodation in the shadow of the often snow-capped Atlas Mountains. Approximately five kilometres away, shopaholics can experience the Semmarine Souk. it was great good for famillie  ,everything was good don't listen to other small details  complainers ,it was clean good good I mean breakfast ,nice swimming pool
Room was clean but towels and beddings are so old and i got itchy. Both room types include a toilet, satellite TV, telephone, hair dryer and safe. We're able to change room on arrival as needed a twin room for no extra cost. And room was so noisy even i'm hearing the people talking in my next room. Convenient location, friendly staff, rooms need some restoration, however enough comfort for the price. Very easy to get from gare du nord to Rome metro station. The facilities were very basic and the furniture was old but given the price we were paying for Paris and it's general reviews/star rating we were not surprised. The Rome metro stop on line 2 only a few metres from the front door, and there is a metro stop for line 13 in Place Clichy. The Cabourg offers two room types, one with a bath, the other with a shower. Founded in 1978, the Hotel de Cabourg is a 2 start hotel located on Rue du Mont-Dore in the 17th Arrondissement in Paris. Breakfast costs €5 and is taken in the dining room. Being relatively close to the centre of Paris, the hotel is close to some of Paris' most popular attractions such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Moulin Rouge, Parc Monceau, the Champs Élysées and the Sacré Coeur. Unless you want luxury this is a reasonable place especially if you only want a place for overnight stay. Able to accommodate keeping our bags after we'd checked out instead of dragging them round. The Hotel was situated in easy reach of the Metro, Close to Restaurants and Coffee houses. The Hotel Cabourg is situated close to Place Clichy, and only metres away from the Boulevarde des Batignolles. The cheaper room option is available as a single, double or twin, and the room with a bath is available as a single, double or triple room. The staff were extremely friendly always happy and could speak good enough English.
I know the price was low for London but I expected more than instant coffee and toast for breakfast, more than a flimsy tiny single bed. London hotels typically have small rooms and this was no exception however it was clean and everything worked. Walking distance to stores and shopping centers including parks and local stations. The hotel was in a good location for Central London, the staff were friendly and the luggage room was really useful on the days we arrived and left! Very good for the value and in a great location Free tea and coffee in the rooms + a few places to charge your phone. Only in the area for one night, I needed a value, well-located place to stay and found that at the Wedgewood. Beds were terrible lights and toilet were not functioning or broken  breakfast was minimal and overcrowded room was Very small. They went the extra mile to get room ready as I arrived earlier than check in time. All furniture was dated, the place needs a desperate lick of paint (though that's only the tip of the iceberg), beds need new mattresses, and it was certainly an experience to open wardrobe doors to find a bathroom. I don't blame the staff, they were good, but whoever runs the hotel ought to update it throughout and give it the potential it could have to make it fit for purpose. The location for the hotel is great.Would definitely recommend to any budget travellers. It is in close proximity to some of London’s major attractions. Transportation including red buses and tubes are within walking distance from the hotel. Bathroom is so tiny, room is so small you can barely move around...but the hotel location is close to everything which is very convenient.. close to Bayswater train station... Other nearby attractions include Oxford Street, Buckingham Palace, and Notting Hill. Rooms feature a TV, telephone, coffee and tea making facilities, and an en-suite bathroom with a shower or bath and toilet. This hotel offers 24-hour reception, multilingual staff members, taxi service and assistance in booking guided tours of London. Shower was barely warm in the am but scalding midday. location is  very important we're ever you go, the hotel is in the heart of the city ,you can go were ever you want  in the city & you wouldn't have any problem to get transport 24/7  less than 5 minutes from dorchester hotel & 2 minute walks to hyde park The Wedgewood Hotel is a small hotel located in a traditional garden square in Bayswater. Free WiFi and Breakfast, daily linen change and elevator on site. The room however was a bit run down, fairly clean but no plug in the sink, the shower was rather old and the mattress was a bit uncomfortable as the springs were well worn! For £75 a night it was OK but would probably pay more for a better condition hotel next time. The Wedgewood Hotel does not have restaurants on the property. Was impressed by the cleanliness of the rooms and hotel in general. The location is good, close to shops and 2 tube stations as well as Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park.
The room was spacious, but I was a little disappointed that there was a fridge but no microwave. The staff were super awesome and just hope they do something about their showers. Rooms a little old so you could hear a lot through the walls from other rooms. They let you park your car in their lot without extra charge and you can walk to Disneyland in a jiffy. The hot and cold water were reversed in the shower, but once we figured that out...it was easy to use. I have never had better or kinder service at a hotel. If you want to be close to Disneyland pay the extra $40 and stay somewhere nicer. I was very skeptical booking this hotel, but we were in a bind since we are traveling with the pet last minute luckily everything turned out fine. If you want good, not great...this is the place for you. I was out of the room before 11am each day, yet my last 2 days the maid service said that I had the Do Not Disturb out, which was not the case, and didn't clean the room. Crap, bugs in rooms... not worth a penny wouldn't go back if you paid me! The only issue we had this time around was that our room, unlike every other room we have had here, did not have light blocking curtains. If you look though they just painted over a bunch of old stuff. The hotel has a nice overall remodel that was done. They've done a lot of work to the lobby/exterior but even the remodeled rooms are just okay. Bathroom floor was a bit dirty, but you get what you paid for. It's an easy walk to the Disney parks, even for our 7- and 5-year-old kids who were exhausted at the end of each day. Guests enjoy simple rooms with TV, fridge, and coffee maker. my family and I  enjoyed this hotel very much , the best part is the pizza joint connected to the hotel. The curtains were old and the bed was a little springy. The Anaheim Plaza Hotel is spread out among acres of stunning scenery. parking fee is not for 24hrs, only till check out. But I wouldn’t recommend it to friends that have smal children. Nor does it work if you hit one of the programmed buttons for room service, the front desk, or emergency services. I really do miss the breakfast buffet they used to have in the morning!! the pizza place downstairs is nothing short of phenomenal though well worth 10$. This is by far the absolute worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, and it was more expensive than the other hotels in the area. Parking is easy and there's lots available, front desk staff was kind and helpful. Even saying no thank you they still would still try and try to get us to sign up. The next day we left the sliding glass door to the balcony opened all day and slightly at night. Guess they heard me when i said rooms needed usb power strips! The front desk said they would send someone right over. I hope that they sort it out because that was only thing that we could really fault at this budget priced hotel. Walking distance to California adventure and many shops and restaurants, needs facility excellent pool delicious pizza at the pizza press. It was an odd room with two King beds, but we needed a room and it had a decent rate. Water temperature kept going from hot to cold without me changing it in the shower. I have stayed in most all hotels across the street from Disneyland. Overall the condition is decent and it’s in walking distance to Disney which is good. I spend about 20 days here a hear as a Disneyland Annual pass holder. I was very happy that the hotel had a fitness center and laundry room. However the hot water system seems to have a major problem, it cannot maintain a constant temperature, from warm to ice cold, back to warm then to hot. The pluses:  1)  The staff was very attentive and friendly. Sabrina and Joseph in the lounge extra friendly and pleasant. Recently upgraded, although still has a 70's vibe which we loved! The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk of Disneyland. Over Priced!Room Look Nice but the Hotel had a very old smell to it. It was a great get away  It was nice to be able to walk to dl As soon as we walked into our room, I could sense  strong chemical smell. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how the phone works, as it doesn't just work when you pick up the receiver. The room was disgusting there were dead bugs on the bathroom counter, the sink would clog up, carpet was filthy had dried up ramen noodles either from a spill or from vomit the bedding was good. I think if they see a couple is staying at their hotel, they would put them on the top floor. If you have an emergency, and don't know this, the results could be dire. For a bargain hotel this place is it......granted it is not the resort hotels....but love its location and price. I can see the changes they are making and they are for the better. Close to Disneland but room was not so great , air conditioner didn’t work to well, shower head was short, my son who is 5-9 and to crouch down to wash hair, grout in bathroom was looking dirty and peeling, wouldn’t ever stay here again, staff were supper though ! We waited up even though we were tired after the flight and they never came. Yes, the hotel is a little outdated in the room department but the beds were comfortable the pillows were comfortable the room it’s self with clean. Our room had a awesome patio and the bar tender made amazing drinks!! Super helpful, friendly staff, and so close to many amenities, number one being Disneyland. The staff and service were excellent, the room, however was frustrating. Hotel is always clean, great size and I just love the walk out balcony. The room didn’t look anything like the pictures displayed online, but was ok. Also, the shower never got hot ... just warm, and we had to space out our showers to wait for the water to get hot again. You can’t even tiptoe to the bathroom at night without announcing your movements to everyone. I was called when security noticed that I had left the dome light on in our car. The beds are pretty comfortable and there's a fridge in each room. Unfortunately, they put us right under a very loud family with kids. I recommend it every time, close walk to the parks. The shower leaked all over the floor, so I had a flood of soaked towels after the 2 days of no cleaning. The water pressure was very low and the water heat was not consistent. Located a short distance from Disneyland Resort , the Anaheim Plaza Hotel is 1 mile from Interstate-5 and three blocks from the city's convention center. This accommodation is also known as Anaheim Plaza, Anaheim Plaza Anaheim, Anaheim Plaza Hotel, and Anaheim Plaza Hotel Anaheim. The bathrooms are the least impressive and can definitely still use some work. We did not know this when we booked this is new. The hotel was recently updated, and the beds and pillows were nice. He was great however the front desk  Clerk was not so friendly. They did an upgrade to a very old room, new carpet, shower head, and beds, but the plumbing backed up on us, and the heater didn't work so we were very cold in the room all 4 nights. We got asked every time walking threw to get to our room or leaving to go to Disneyland about 3-4 times a day. Only part that annoyed me was every time we walked through the lobby there were Representatives trying to get us to go to a hour and a half long sales pitch at one of there other hotels we were there for 5 days and got asked every single time we walked through. Prepare yourself the queen beds are actually the size of double beds, i measured. We've stayed at this property a handful of times and it has become our go-to disneyland hotel. It is my families favorite  its close to Disneyland lots of restaurants nearby But I must say the rooms do have a musty smell :/. The shower was not good at all, the water was either too hot or too cold, could never set it right. And there were bugs coming out from the wall behind the shower faucet, which was also broken. Since he’s the first person  you coming contact with he should learn to be friendlier . Maintenance came and fixed the toilet right away, and did something to the heater...but it still didn't work. There was a bill on our door the day we left! This meant no naps in the afternoon for our preschooler. The wiring was faulty, either non-working outlets, or old outlets where the cords would just fall right out. The only thing that was kind of annoying was walking threw the lobby people always asked if we wanted to sign up for Stuff ( “free” dining )   . The toilet roll holder was falling off the wall, and wouldn't hold the paper roll. Probably needs some renovation as the tiles were crooked and there were obviously signs of repair such as dried drywall mud exposed in the bathroom, the floor in the bathroom had two different kinds of tile, and the floor in the shower itself was raised to two different levels. We like this hotel because it is close to Disney and we can walk, which used to be great so we didn’t have to pay for parking, but now the hotel charges for parking. The room that we stayed in while far from new or modern, was clean and neat. The big plus about this hotel was that it was a short walk to Disney, the Convention Center, and to the new Anaheim Garden Walk area that is still being occupied. No breakfast buffet   Well there are many good options available around, it’s not worth paying such money. Came back from being at disney all day....toilet wasn't flushing. The hotel staff were very friendly and the pizza press restaurant located in the lobby was pretty good too. You have to click the ON button, which is a black button with dark grey printing, before the phone works. If you’re on a budget this isn’t too bad of an option. The pool and hot tub were excellent, and The Pizza Press restaurant connected to the hotel had an amazing beer selection and really tasty pizza. The facilitys and rooms are clean, and the employees are friendly. We have stayed here for years because we are season pass holders and never paid to park I am 6’1” and my feet hung off the beds. Service was great, the room was very clean and not very noisy, and the location was very close to Disneyland. The plumbing left us with little to no hot water and at times sputtered out spraying everywhere in the sink. However, this is always my go to hotel for Disneyland for price and convenience! The ac blew warm air...and had black dust/mold in it. It was so strong that l could not sleep the first night. The good side is that is a short walk from resort. This hotel is going through a refurb and I guess we got an old room. Rooms were very nice but beds seemed small for a queen size. It got to the point we avoided the lobby as often as possible. Overall it was a good stay, just hope they get water issues fixed. The room was clean and it is close to the park The location is what sold me on booking this hotel. Very thin walls we can hear people walking by arguing throughout the night. This hotel was far better than I was expecting for the price we payed. Some rooms have a patio, a microwave is available upon request, and Wi-Fi is accessible via a surchage. We were able to check or bags in early and go over to Disneyland for a few hours until our room was ready at 4pm. The curtains are so thin that at 6:50 every morning I was greeted with blinding brightness filling the entire room. Our stay was overall good, the bathroom could be a tiny bit cleaner. Our bathroom was tiny and we couldn't keep the shower water temperature to stay at a comfortable degree. The location could not have been more perfect, it’s right across the street from Disneyland and around the corner from the Anaheim garden walk shopping/dining center. Quality affordable accommodation within easy walk of the Disneyland parks and nearby shops. They charge for parking rate of $12+ tax for every night. They will charge you more if you leave your vehicle while at Disneyland. Clean, comfortable and within walking distance to Disneyland and numerous restaurants and shops. A lot of the nicer hotels in the area do not allow pets. The hotel grounds are immaculate it gives a very old Hollywood vibe. I thought i was accidentally put into a double bed room, and after addressing the staff they said that that was their queen beds. The rooms have that old closet smell and just about any noise is extremely loud. And id also specify to not have an eastern facing room. I like the big swimming pool and area to suntan. Noisy bathroom fan, closet doors of track, entry door sticks. If you like that old, musky, grandpa smell, this is the place for you. It was good, but service was slow and it really wasn't a breakfast restaurant...just a pizza parlor that served breakfast in the morning. 3)  The restaurant and lobby were nicely updated, and while we didn't have dinner we did eat breakfast in the morning. Got the hotel due to it’s close Proximity to Disneyland. The door frame looked like someone had kicked it in. If you like being unable to find hot water in the shower, this is cold water heaven. They are in the process of updating rooms and we stayed iin one. We ended up staying at this hotel because they are dog friendly.A lot of the nicer hotels in the area do not allow pets. Guests can take pleasure in dining at a bar and grill and Mexican restaurant located on the premises. 2)  We had early check-in...very early, and that was an unexpected surprise. The hotel offers guests an atmosphere of both excitement and relaxation. The hotel provides an outdoor swimming pool, game room, and business center. We didn’t need a shuttle to the park, Disney front gate was in walking distance.
I was happy to check in, he offered tea or coffee. All guest rooms feature a hair dryer, TV and Wi-Fi access. They offer guests tea and coffee making facilities onsite and pubs and restaurants are within a 10-20 minute walk. Dated and bathroom was worn but was cheapest and that suited me. Bed extremely uncomfortable,Bathroom cold and dirty with tiles of the wall and mould growing all around no plug in basin,and an open hole in the wall where a vent use to be. Manager Jeff was waiting for when I arrived at night. Revive Lodge is an economical B&B for travellers to or from Heathrow Airport since it's about 2 miles away. Revive Lodge is a 10-minute walk or less to the 24-hour bus stop for the airport or Feltham Train Station that takes guests into central London. But someone need to stay just for a night  might be alright. Not one for for the girls  Manager was very helpful and obliging. The hotel provides 24-hour reception when needed, central heating, fax machine, ironing set, shampoo, tour information and wake-up service. The room choices include single rooms, twin rooms or double ensuite rooms.
There aren't many spaces, but I managed to get a space. The room was very small and uncomfortable and the walls were so thin you could hear the snoring from the next room. Rooms are quite basic, small and a bit outdated but there is everything you need. Unfortunately my bedroom had an extremely musty smell and I think maybe someone had been smoking in it. There are loads of places nearby to eat, and the guest information pack in the room was very handy at pointing out some of these places. The hotel itself was clean but in need of some updating and tlc. The toilet flush not very  good its slow, there was a nasty smell coming from shower plughole so didnt bother using it. Roseview Alexandra Palace offers Victorian accommodations in Muswell Hill and Haringey, with the famous Alexandra Palace only a 12-minute walk away. ; coffee & tea facilities; clean towels.. but there was also a fan plus an air conditioning unit supplied too. Overall an enjoyable stay, I would stay here again, and recommend to friends. I only had time for breakfast on one of the days, but it was ok, a few different options available on the buffet table, and met the usual expectations. This hotel is located in Muswell Hill and not Alexandra Palace, which is a bonus as the shops and restautants etc are all in Muswell Hill. In reality there were only a couple of very small spaces which were all taken. Hotel did show signs of age, but it was clean, staff were friendly and helpful, and for the price we paid, very reasonable Buses run regularly down to there, and take between 35 and 55 minutes depending on the time of day, so easy enough. And couldn't get breakfast even though it wasn't end of service! The bathroom, whilst very small, was nice and clean and the water pressure in the shower was great. Old school hotel with friendly staff, cooked breakfast and comfortable rooms. Lovely hotel, in good condition it was a pleasure to stay there and I would recommend it to others. The bed was so hard and the pillows and duvet were of very poor quality. All clean and tidy which was nice but shower and tv very temperamental! The staff do try to accommodate on that end.... recommendation will depend on the people I am speaking to... I did mention to reception as I was leaving, but he just said that I had to leave the tap on. the only thing we puffed at was the stairs all  the way up to the garret. The shower was useless there was more water coming out of the pipe than the head and it was just run down. We found a space 15 mins down the road but felt the description was very misleading. The check in was painless, and the staff were great. Good hotel , shower box in room , went to watch a concert nearby , breakfast was good. A very small downside would be that the walls are very thin, I could hear the people next door snoring, again only a small issue but overall I enjoyed my stay and would return again. Understandably a bit of noise(with being in laaaandan)  We were in a three bed room and it was adequate. When you went to the rooms it was very tired and cluttered and in serious need for a refurbishment. I could not even stand up in the room, it was a rooftop room with small space and lots of stairs to reach the room There was no hot water for the shower - and I left the tap running for some time (10 minutes) but no water came out of the hot tap. The breakfast was really good too, with a wide range of hot and cold foods on offer. This is one place I would never stay again as it’s horrendous. We stayed after a concert at Alexandra Palace and it was very convenient for the venue. My room was quite small, and the furniture was a bit aged, but I had everything I needed, and was happy with the room. There were some other amenities as well; A decent Iron, an ironing board, a hairdryer, a fan, and an additional blanket. Most modern rooms feature a flat screen TV with a DVD player, while coffee and tea making facilities, a clothing iron and hair dryer come standard. There are many dining options nearby including Carluccio’s, Pizza Express, O’Neills, Giraffe and Costa Coffee. I did not call the management at this point but had to rush on to the Fair so did not have time to wait further. The 3rd floor rooms require helmets to be issued - do not know how many times I banged my head on the ceiling (sloped for the roof - half the room is good for standing - the rest not so much, a lot of crouching). wifi didnt work unless you were in reception and only 2 parking spots for the whole hotel I was working in Islington and needed an affordable hotel that wasn't too far away and had parking. Bed clean and comfortable enough pillows are a little too firm .Bathroom needs attention. The reception was easy and the man was polite and helpful. For convenience, the hotel offers 24-hour reception, concierge services, luggage storage and complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby. We booked this hotel as it was described as having free parking. Coffee and tea making facilities were more than ample, and there was also a small fridge which was a nice touch. Breakfast nice could do with some more choices on cooked meat but overall good. Sports fans will appreciate being only a few minutes from the Arsenal Emirates Stadium and the Wembley Stadium. We were assigned a room on the 3rd floor, with no lift available. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi, onsite parking, and a daily breakfast buffet. It was clean and there was hot water so no complaints. This was a tough haul for two 65+ hauling two large bags plus 4 smaller bags. Booked a family room to attend a function at Alexander Palace, ideally located for walking to and from the venue, even very late at night. Where they’d bodged up paining in the past there was paint on the TV cable where it hadn’t been removed and also they’d painted round pictures. Very clean room with a fantastic set-up for the customer. Clean, nice staff, and great location, I went to a gig at Alexandra Palace and this was about a 10 minute walk from the venue. The rooms are clean, breakfast is fabulous; parking - well good luck! Nice people, very clean room, with very up-to-date nice bathroom. This is an older style hotel that is clean, comfortable and close to shops and transport. Roseview Alexandra Palace is located within three miles of the Kenwood House, Highgate Ponds, Finsbury Park, and only 25 minutes from the London city centre. The hotel is comfortable and very handy for a cheap and cheerful one night b&b. Staff should have seen us struggling but denied it, offered to help with checkout but seemed too much hassle (again they should have known and apologized after the fact). Brilliant everyone was really lovely, great location for Alexandra Palace. It claimed to have free parking but space was extremely limited and full by the time that I arrived at 8.30 pm. Hotel was very good for the price, as was the breakfast. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful and available 24hrs. Lots of stairs to climb, but it's an old building. Nice that there was WiFi, but the speed was pretty abysmal, good enough for just checking emails, but no use for streaming. There was a fan provided though and a mini fridge. On having breakfast in the morning I went down at 09:10 as it finishes at 09:30 I finally got seen by a waitress at 09:30 even though there was only 5 people in the Breakfast lounge and I asked for the full English which was replied rudely with no it’s closed, on a upside though another waitress heard and offered to cook me a couple of eggs of which I replied it’s not necessary but thankyou. Hotel was accommodating and ideal for our short stay needs Which considering the weather was hot & humid was very welcome. Breakfast a little better than the continental I was expecting.
while Riva Restaurant offers guests a classic American cuisine for both breakfast and lunch. The room had a chemical smell to it and we didnt put it together until we saw a roach in our room on the last day. The staff would deliver and set them up wherever you liked. We enjoyed the pool, the beach, and the city were we enjoyed several great meals. The yogurt shop on the property ran out of yogurt on Sunday and told us they would have more again until Wednesday....Valet service was to busy to call cabs for you... overall, worst experience at a hotel, especially for the price. The expense of staying here detracts from the experience it could have been. My room was sprayed for roaches before we got there and no one told us. Excellent location, very friendly staff, my second time visiting this location with my 25 and 23 year old daughters . If you didn't want to walk to the beach bar, they had what I called, The Adult Ice Cream Truck. I don’t feel like I got $60 worth of benefits from that. We have been staying at the Harbor Beach resort for over 20 years and no matter what changes or us updates, it remains a wonderful place to vacation. There's a $30 day service charge but it included chairs/umbrellas on their beautiful beach. Get up early to secure pool chairs or you'll be disappointed. Never got a mini fridge because you have to request those... so I took one from the hall that was left from cleaning out a room. Over all an awesome place to stay and I look forward to my next visit Bathroom was dirty and had this sharp point on the floor that I called about and nothjbg done. I had read about this in other reviews and thought it an overreaction, but $14 for a bar drink is crazy. The hotel is right on the beach which is a plus, the beah bathrooms, sea side restaurante are 3 stars, staff are excellent. Love the outdoor pool, hot tubs are incredible, non-water sports kept them busy when they didn’t feel like swimming. Also, on the beach and around the pool area, were various free outdoor activities, that entertained young and old alike. The hotel also has good restaurants & is close to shopping. We switched rooms twice, during our 10 day, extremely expensive family vacation with our children, first room, we opened windows and were looking at a brick wall, no one wanted to help us find a different room, the gentleman that brought our luggage up seemed to be the only person at the hotel that cared about our experience, then we found the cockroaches in room two on two separate occasions. Killed a cockroach and called front desk about it.. the guys were never full cleaned up. Perhaps a review of utilization of space up and around the oool area could free more space and reduce crowding. In the mornings, look for all the sea turtle tracks and talk to the very nice turtle preservation folks riding around on 4-wheelers, marking and tracking the nests. My only complaint would be that the drink prices are absolutely ridiculous. We have been there many times through past 10 years & will continue to stay there. Kids can go play while you spend the day at the spa. Great time ..lots of Kids and families dinner at 3030 was excellent We had to keep following up with the front desk... the did not seem concerned, we requested to speak to the manager, three times over our trip and not a single phone call, we are home now and still no follow-up. Housekeeping did not clean the room after a couple of calls however I was provided a fridge for leftovers I had at the restaurant and was allowed to have them reheat the food the next day which was great. For our fifth anniversary, we decided to go back to the Marriott Harbor Beach. The number of times I had to listen to others complain about the same things was ridiculous. Very nice location - it was great to take a quick break and walk along the ocean between sessions. Great hotel however booked on Expedia and given a room far the elevators. I was at the hotel over two nights for a work conference. Overall, my stay here was nothing, but a pleasure and I would definitely stay here again. I know its Florida and roaches can be an issue but they should have told us before giving us a room with freshly sprayed chemicals in it. For breakfast one morning our waiter never showed and we had to get a manager after sitting at the table for 30 minutes... we gave up on the hotel restaurants and left the property to eat every time. Note: there are no life guards at pool or beach. A concerted effort has been made on hotel WiFi to block Uber access... Concierge service was not helpful directing us to shuttle service because they were not directly associated with the hotel. Motorized water sports were also available, but for a fee. Harbor Beach Marriott is such a beautiful place to stay. By the end of the week, we gave up caring and spent as much time away from the property as possible. The price paid for staying plus food is exaggerated for what you get. When we requested bedding for the sofa bed it was again, understaffed overbooked with no timeframe for arrival... this was the theme for the entire week... we tried to get chairs by the pool but they were all taken by 8 am everyday so many times we out our stuff on the grass so we could go to the pool. The room was not cleaned properly, one day we had to call 3 times to get the room cleaned, they came by 6 pm when we were having a shower, we had to rush because the cleaning service ended at 7. I did not like the poolside DJ playing rap 1/2 the day. The hotel had a guitarist playing and singing in the afternoons at the pool. Really nothing bad to say, but there was also nothing  really special or memorable about the stay Featuring private balconies and ocean views, each room boasts luxurious amenities such as a marble bathroom, in-room safe and tea and coffee making facilities. There is also an on-site fitness center and parking available, while a concierge desk helps guests with planning their stay. Everything is at your fingertips and top of the line! Food and drinks were a little pricey and the distance to the hotspots (elbo room)  is a bit too far to walk. Situated near the airport on a waterfront location, Marriott Fort Lauderdale Harbor Beach Resort & Spa offers guests a 16-acre private beach and a 22000-square-foot spa. Nothing was explained to me about the resort at check in. Thankfully Uber is very popular in this area so we just made a quick trip to stock the room for the week - problem solved. The resort is family friendly and though expensive, you get what you pay for. Marriott Fort Lauderdale Harbor Beach Resort & Spa features the Tropical Lagoon outdoor pool and whirlpool for guests enjoyment. The one draw back was the selection of places to eat. Waitress service at my beach lounge and more variety of in site entertainment. For the money you pay all rooms should have a balcony. If you have a rental or just a car it’s 35 bucks a day. I actually doubt that anyone every told the manager of any of our problems, our entire family of 16 has gone there for 10 years, this was our first year joining them there and will be our last. The hotel is beach front and has a very nice heated pool. Got extra towels so we did not have to walk on the floor. I would have like to have a balcony to creat a better stay. Kids zone was an up charge but our 6-year-old daughter loved it. They ran out of towels by the pool daily...   Food was terrible at all restaurants and overpriced... wait staff and service was slow or non-existent. Did not have much time to enjoy the scenery or the neighboring restaurants, clubs, etc. Las Olas Boulevard is just 2 miles away from this hotel, while there are many different boat tours in the nearby area. Only negative was food--wasn't made with quality ingredients or expertly prepared. This Marriott is one of the finest choices one can make. But I guess the girl giving us a comp breakfast for four people (we had 5) was supposed to make us happy. So, not sure what the 30 dollar hotel charge was for a day. We arrived at the hotel very early after leaving a cruise ship and were able to check into a room and head to the pool. I cannot wait to come back and was so sad leaving! The room was really set up well--enough room for the four of us even though we didn't splurge for a higher room class. Food was amazing, and resort was absolutely stunning I would go back definitely! Booked and prepaid an oceanfront room  2 months in advance. Despite some beautification projects that were underway, the hotel facilities, staff, etc. 3030 Ocean Restaurant is located on-site and features a range of seafood dishes for dinner. hotel offer room refrigerator for 25$,, but it takes 4 days to get one. The view from my room was uninspiring - I'm sure it is impressive on the ocean front side. Amazing place and all the staff was so friendly, private beach area and so much to do Great beach access, clean facilities , beautiful pool and grounds, good service at the restaurants and tiki bar. Unexpected fun thing to do, for us:  Museum of Discovery and Science offers a Sea Turtle evening class (at the museum) followed by a beach hike for turtles that took place at this hotel. Great facilities but restaurants were overpriced, crowded, bland and pricey. Our room was never cleaned, very expensive drinks- $14 each, fire pit did not work, food was very good but no catch of the day at upscale casual restaurants. When the water ran out outside by the pool and I asked an orange shirt staff member about it she told me she would get to it when she got it.. ummm what?!?! We did not have a place to change, could not get assistance by the pool or beach.... Never got the extra blanket for our child we requested. I found the grounds to be well maintained and my guest room clean. There was no soap, we had to go an find it. Guests were not crammed together and there was no shortage of loungers or umbrellas. Adult beverages, including frozen, were delivered and made for you on the beach. Nice being right on the beach instead of across the street like many other Fort Lauderdale hotels. This hotel was a never go back to.... when we arrived after check in hours our room was not ready because they were overbooked and understaffed with no idea of when the room would be ready. Didn't have to leave the resort, great place to relax! Will never go back again as it was a week of poor service, bad food and just the hotel wishing to book completely and not care about the guests. Only thing they need to address is crowding if pool lounges by the pool.
Hotel staff was very understanding after our airline was delayed and missed our connecting flight into Las Vegas. Staff were extremely indifferent, dismissal and at times  basically Rude; the Staff need to be made aware that They are there to Serve Us the paying Vacationers , especially when so many other Hotels and Casinos are available, dissatisfied Vacationers can easily  go were they are more appreciated . We had originally thought about staying at the Bellagio but found the MGM better value for money. *The iron didn't work (hence leaving the pants in the closet) *The bathroom sink was clogged the first day. No discounts on hotel facilities or shows for hotel guests which we found surprising. It was at the end of a dead end hallway. Got in after a long flight no hot water for a shower. A resort as the MGM should live up to its brand, this should not happen. Hotel has a lot to offer in restaurants shops and gambling. The Wolfgand Puck cafe is great value for money along with Starbucks. The many of the casino dealers and hostesses are not friendly. I have stayed here before and it was great, What Happened? They claim the restaurants are non-smoking but there are no walls preventing the casino from the restaurants so we decided to eat our meals elsewhere. We had fun at the pool, good for kids and adults. I suppose it’s vegas..all they do is try and take every penny you have..Water pressure was terrible the second day I was there..for the most part I can roll with things..it’s a resort..they should have their things together in one way shape or form..I’m also saying this from someone who had stayed in Vegas 6 times previous..stsy somewhere esle..not worth it..buffet is terrible and the rooms are mediocre at best: *The also said they would send me an itemized receipt with all my room charges which they did not. But I want to specifically point out the customer service we received. Highway road side Motels are much better than this room. We do visit frequently and try to find places that we haven't been to just to make new memories. Tried to Contact hotel no one has yet to respond. We have stayed at a lot of MGM resorts but never this one. The only other oddity is if all doors are open, from the toilet you can see along the hotel corridor. Crib they provided was metal and very squeaky every time our kid moved. MGM Grand also offers guests a lazy river and fitness centre on site. Room doors handles gave static electric shock to me and my kids many times. The accommodation puts guests a three-minute stroll from M&M's World. It was OK way too big but I could be in the wrong town We were told the water would be on again by morning, and they would deduct $39 from our bill. Resort fees are a rip-off, housekeeping didn't replace used toiletry items daily, smoke wafts into the non-smoking floors/rooms, casino absolutely reeks of smoke (it should be non-smoking! We asked 4 staff members, with he first 3 sending us in the wrong direction and the last finally getting us to the right spot. Bring good walking shoes (nothing is as close as it looks) and Enjoy! We truly loved how they made sure we were comfortable and answered all of our questions. When I got home I called and they admitted the error and reimbursed me the next business day. The business centre and three hot tubs are an added bonus. I happened to be changing when he stopped in my window! The hotel's location is its best feature - being right on the strip allowed us to easily walk everywhere we needed to without needing to use any other form of transport. We absolutely loved it - spotlessly clean, friendly & helpful staff and everything you could possibly want available inside the hotel. The concierge team are fantastic and booked us tables at some amazing restaurants with no hassle at all. We live in Washington State and YES, it does rain all the time! We specifically stayed at the mgm for the lazy river, but unfortunately it was shut down until may. Staff told us considering we were early they would put a rush on the room to be ready. Window washer in my window on the 18th floor with NO memo that could be happening. The location itself is wonderful and the facilities have everything you would need from food, beverages, pool areas, gym etc. I didn't hear any other guests, but I could hear the helicopters even over a white noise machine that we had brought. We got to enjoy the Jabawockeez show, which was a highlight. Tried to call front desk but it was to long of a hold that I hung up . When Checking In or Checking Out , the Front Desk were far from Welcoming , never offered any direction or information as to what Restaurants or Entertainment were available, or what Services the Hotel provides, Guests were forced to fend for themselves. The hotels really good everywhere is clean and lots of stuff todo. (I would post photos but I only took videos of the rooms. We paid extra for an upgrade and when we got there they had no king rooms available and our view was the back of other building. Lots of options to get up and down the Strip for cheap- think Duece bus, Monorail and tons of pedestrian bridges (with elevators) attached to hotels. First vist to MGM and thought that it would be an awesome getaway for me and my wife. We get there to find the entire pool area CLOSED at 6 pm!!! Had to run the water for over 20mins to try and get hot water. Hard to get comfortable  until your stuff  has landed too. The bottles were intact, and i put them back into the fridge when i was done with the fruit salad, and still the manager told me they hire some people to do the restocking (which, again, i did it myself) and thus they had to charge me. Guests are just over two kilometres from McCarran International Airport. After also spending more than enough money within the hotel, we were then told we needed to spend a minimum of $20 on food to borrow a bottle opener. The only thing that took me by surprise we're the buffet prices for breakfast we're a bit pricey,  and we went on the early bird breakfast dates that were a bit cheaper. Only down fall is that the staff don't actually know how to give directions to your room. No service apart from the concierge which is great from 8 am to 8 pm. Location is great the staff helpful and polite hope to stay again in July. The staff was friendly and helpful, the check in was easy. The hotel is huge and we were forever getting lost which was not much fun. Look out for the $33 resort charge and the abrupt staff. I know there were a lot of kids because it is that time for school aged kiddos to have spring break, but I thought the filter system would have taken care of these issues. Great staff, good facilities, very clean room, but our room was not comfortable at all. Signature suites are a way better bang for your buck. What can I say a beautiful vacation, with an exceptional staff. Location ideal, very friendly & helpful staff, room and hole hotel spotless no problem recommend it to family or friends i thought we paid a resort fee to cover these sort of things but they were like holding out there hands in anticipation of receiving a tip and if you didn't comply they were rude and ignorant. Our room was nice and had a decent amount of space, however it didn't look like it had been cleaned well. The only issue I have is the water pressure for the shower is weak. Upon arrival we were early and were given access to the only one ready which was ok but long walk and Im a post op back surgery patient. Have to remember the size of the hotel and the fact the state is basically in a continual drought. We had to speak with a manager to get results. Amenities you have to pay for at the hotel and you don't have a choice would have liked to pick and choose what was paying for rather than have to pay for things I didn't use or want. Wellness-themed rooms add aromatherapy diffusers while suites boast Roman bathtubs. And unfortunately upon check out the hotel charged me twice. There were a few other pools which were packed with kids during the day. We were given the last room at the end of a two block hallway from the main elevator, which is fine but the room was not clean for three days until we complained to the front desk, use the same towels for three days ran out toilet paper had to go get some from one of the casino bathrooms, one tiny soap had to go and buy my own same as shampoo. The lazy river was closed went we went, which Hotels.com hadn't included so we were very disappointed - this was the main reason we chose MGM Grand. No information on how to operate locked mini bar - they charge if you place other items in the fridge too. My only complaint would be that the lazy river was closed the whole time The faucets are hard to use and there’s very little counter space at sink. Booked hotel for lazy river pool which I used before. Back there in 10 days let's hope it's fixed by then They charged me a $50 restocking fee for taking sone bottles out of the fridge in order to make room for a fruit salad i bought outside. Water and Coffee super expensive, CVS and Walgreens are located on the strip near every hotel-get extras snacks, drinks, personal items etc there. I was a little disappointed MGM charged $25 a day for valet and $15 a day for self park along with the resort fees. Well they didn't send someone until almost 9pm when we first arrived at 2pm. Black Jack table are a minimum $15 at night vs. $10 elsewhere. We stayed in a much nicer suite at Treasure island for a few dollars cheaper. The moment we got up to our room and opened the door it smelled like sewage. This was my second stay on the property and would stay again. MGM Grand Garden Arena sits a five-minute walk away, and KÀ by Cirque du Soleil can be reached in a seven-minute walk. Boasting a 24-hour casino, MGM Grand sits on Las Vegas' famous Strip. Wifi does work downstairs in the lobby and casino if you really need it. You have to park in a parking bay 7 minutes walk to the elevators. I understand the casinos allowed smoking but you had to walk through a cloud of it every morning and evening and all the other hotel casinos we visited did not smell as bad as MGM. The cleaners and bell hops were easily the nicest most well informed staff working there. Seriously, for that price, not even a free cup of coffee? My first night at the Grand I was awoke by an overwhelming smell of skunk...twice. We immediately called the front desk and asked for a different room. I still went about my visit since I didn't want to complain. Guests have access to marble bathrooms and TVs with cable channels. First time staying at the MGM Grand, staff was very friendly and helpful. On a good note, I complained and the staff righted it immediately. The room is small and unconfortable and also the bathroom is small and just a tub wich is cover with a curtain. The place seems 'money hungry' and nickle and dime you to death! Hi it was nice other then check in they whated 400.00 dollars for a deposit and we had already paid hotel fees but over all it was nice love the stay Secondly we were asked to upgrade the room which we did. Reception could not have been more apologetic and reduced our room bill to compensate for this. We were really sad to hear that the lazy river was not open since that it what we told our kids to look forward to for months before our trip. When I pulled my blankets out to get in bed my sheets had dirt on them. A nook for a bathroom and when I opened a drawer the front of it fell off. There's loads of restaurants and fast food places to eat in the hotel We did the gran canyon by helicopter would definitely recommend this if you go to vegas. It's a hike from the room to restaurants, theater, and food courts. Hotel restaurants pricey but worth it-other affordable options outside of hotels on the Strip. This one had the best value and we will certainly be returning The last thing I will say is that the daily room deposit was a big surprise and I guess we need to read fine print when picking hotels next time. Do not expect your room to come with basics like a kettle, robes or fridge space. The show KA is put on by the MGM and was very entertaining. The food in the Buffet restaurant ist okay but the staff is unfriendly and rude. The main problem we both encountered was that my wife and I were both harassed by men in the casino and my wife was accosted by the small store near the entrance to elevators to our room. And the blackout screen didn't work luckily the green glow goes of at 3am!!!! The only other issue was hearing the airplanes and helicopters with the airport being so close. So they charged me for an upgrade after I had missed my flight and didn’t make it to the hotel the first night because they said my hotel wasn’t ready..that makes no sense to me seeing that I already prepaid for the night I wasn’t there. When we first arrived we upgraded our room to a tower king spa. Didn't realise how much I'd miss even the smallest fridge in a room until we didn't have one here! (and no, it is not in my spam folder) // *I left behind a dress pair of pants in the closet which they made no effort to return or acknowledge.// *No in room coffee. The casino is otherwise poor and cramped and at the wrong end of the strip. We were also told at check in that the room could be 2 Queens or a King even though I thought I selected the King option, of course it cost more to guarantee it. It would have been helpful to have that noted in the hotel information. Love MGM, so many food options, pool is great and rooms are very clean and spacious. We checked in at midnight so there were only 30 people in line in front of us. Then there's checking out you complain and it's fair enough sir we will refund you most of your resort fee only to find out when you get home that the hold on the card is kept by them and not refunded. Go back get a second room drain in the shower didn't drain and the TV didn't work. We decided not to complain but honestly this suite was not that impressive. If we have to come here again this will be our next stay. Restaurants were good and easy access to all that you need. Also, our view from our window was of dumpsters and mattresses very disappointing. No dramas at all other then a lengthy check-in wait and when I went to ask to extend my stay I got a bit of attitude from the people at the front desk . Whilst this is common in Vegas, the MGM also asked for $50 USD just to use the fridge in our room. Only now have they just updated to chip and pin machines so when we arrived we had to wait another 1 and a half in the reception to sort out our card and even then because they hadn't actually updated they're systems I had to give them $400 cash just to get the room I had booked and payed for 6 months prior including being in conversation to our bank in that time which the mgm cashier insisted it wasn't they're fault and not they're system even speaking to the woman on the phone from the bank which told them they were at fault duh! A couple of issues which we reported to reception (no hot water in the shower for 2 days and a room service man with a bad attitude). Waited for my luggage from bell staff who kept on saying its on its way for over 30 minutes. There were pieces of plastic on the floor and various change - which was a hazard with a toddler! We got in to our room and opened the door the faucet was in the bathroom sink water all over the floor with towels. The room smelled a little of smoke (but what in Vegas doesn’t) overall the experience was good. I love the MGM it is the first hotel I ever stayed in Las Vegas, Please fix it and go back to what you used to be. The Hostess at many Restaurants were extremely Rude when asked about wait times for seating and the waitress rushed you through the ordering process . For this price every other hotel in Las Vegas is better than this one. Was in town on honeymoon and for the MCGregor fight :) Loved every minute of our stay. The blinds on the one small windows had broken and were stuck closed, and the mood lighting didn't lighten the room much further. Great accomodation, just one issue was with the hot water. The front desk was very helpful in getting me in my room and the staff has been wonderful except a server who had an real bad attitude I opened the door to my room only to find full trash cans, empty pizza boxes, dirty towels, no toilet paper, dirty sheets, not to mention the place was unorganized. My tip is to not ask for help and just work it out yourself, even if you get lost. We spent 4 days in the MGM Grand and loved every minute of it the staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for you All the restaurants were brilliant and suited every budget Bathroom was dirty and no access to a fridge unless you want alcohol. I don't think I'd stay there again but will definitely gamble in the casino when I'm in town. The toilet was in a weird echo-y room with a glass door—just like the shower. Great shows to see each night, so not far to walk. After that we arrived at the room a little dated with manual operation for the window blinds which could be heard from either next door very early hours of the morning, dirty sheets from the last arrivals which they only change once a week no matter who has been in them and don't even think they clean the room because it's a quick squirt of polish and a wipe here and there. Hotel huge & room nice -- upgraded for a small fee. There were no trash liners in baskets the shower had serious hard water deposits making the shower head weak. Then we were moved to a room in the Grand tower without WiFi. Room amenities have been removed to make more money off you. Only slight downside was the 45 min wait for check in Room was nice and spacious, always clean, staff were very friendly and easy to deal with. It has all the amenities one would look for on the strip. A fabulous holiday and the MGM was a good choice. On arrival we had to pay for a daily hotel fee upfront to use wifi & gym. Wifi didnt work great for us but there is so much to do in vegas, we weren't really that bothered. The Concierge Desk staff were very condescending, gave us no choice in choosing our seats to the Show we purchased . 1/2 our group was is a remodeled room the others were in an old room that was disappointing Also, very disappointed when we were headed down to the pool and wondered why the lazy river wasn't available and it was under construction. good service and all the sites nearby would go back We were offered another room if we wanted to move. There was a very annoying low-frequency noise ALL NIGHT LONG in my room. Hotel was fab and everything we expected it to be. The rooms were nice, the casino was clean, and there are many different restaurants to choose from which served delicious food. Rooms were dated, cigarette burns in the chairs of the room. Even the cheapest, dingiest motels I've stayed in had these basic comforts - included not for an extra fee! The window (which was behind the headboard of the bed) overlooked a courtyard where a worker was sitting on a crate taking a smoking break. Overall it was an excellent experience for it being me and my wifes first visit to Las Vegas. I'd stay there again as its easy access to the strip and everything else but only if it was on sale. Hope you do not get a joining door on your Grand room, otherwise be prepared to hear your room neighbours conversations. The bathroom also looked like it had been recently used - there was water in the shower, I'm hoping from just being cleaned. Room size was good and it was very clean and well maintained. Overall the Staff need a slap on the side of the head , as a Wake Up Call  to Serve the Customer in a curtesy and warm  manner or else we wont be back too much walking from one end of hotel to the other. We don't bother with house keeping because we clean up ourselves we just requested fresh towels and trash removal. This was my wife's first trip to Vegas and we will never stay at MGM Grand again. Most staff were fine but the bell boys just putting your cases away till you collected them later for our journey home were rather abrupt and arrogant! So a few hours at a pool sounded amazing but what a HUGE let down! Resort charge is $35 a day and you get internet for this. *There was a hidden safe in the drawer, which we could not open. The concierge service was very good and had access to many show discounts. Very old  and dirty bathroom in West Wing King. Not sure what or why you have to pay resort fee? Hotel room was clean very nice view was the greatest but ya can't win them all. There is no comparison between photos shown while booking Vs what we actually got. I am never one to complain but it meant a lot and I feel the frustration is what will be remembered Overall good experience but our room needed to be clean more one day we were gone for hours to clean car was outside our room but the room was never clear My room was allocated in west wing which is too far from reception area. The hotel staff was top notch-all very friendly and helpful. There was no facilities to say - that it was a 5 star hotel. Spent 3 nights at the MGM Grand and we had no negative experiences. They helped with a fridge due to some medication I take. I immediately called the front desk and they said there were no open rooms to transfer to but that they would send someone. However, the casino, lobby and public areas are clean and comfortable. It's clean and is a good bang for the buck but waitresses are super slow,  slots are tight and rooms are old and outdated. I didn't go to Vegas to spend my time in a hotel room, and what they offered was accommodating. I booked this hotel for the lazy river pool for my kids but it was closed and I was not aware of this. We will ve going back in October for my 45th Birthday. Shop Groupon or online venues before you travel for shows, buffets, and attractions. However, there is definitely plenty to see and do without even leaving the hotel. Apparently you have to be up higher than the 13th floor to get WiFi. The next night there were kids running and screaming up and down the hallway. Going to front desk was also long lines and I simply gave up. We couldn’t move to a king room until the next day and there were tiles missing in the bathroom and lock on bathroom door was broke. Would really recommend the MGM Grand for first timers to Vegas. We found a what we though was a great deal and booked our stay for a suite for 4 nights. The staff was nice and friendly, particularly Arthur at the front check in! No tea or coffee facilities in room which we would have appreciated! The doors slammed loudly when closed so all night I could hear my neighbors coming and going,  and there were several times it was so loud it sounded like our own door! We were at Treasure Island for our birthdays in March and had such a great time we decided that we would return to visit with friend and family who were going to be there in April. Our room was held until we arrived the following afternoon and was upgraded to a suite. There was a full trash can and shards of glass all over the floor which I didn’t realize until I cut my heel the next morning. If you put anything in their fridge, including insulin, they charged you a re-stocking fee! The Grand is in need of a renovation considering it used to be the crown jewel of the strip and is still the entertainment capital. The negatives:  *Super expensive food, drinks and basically anything purchased in this hotel.// *The smell of stale cigarette smoke was awful. Then upon check out while at the airport I found that I was charged for a third night... after I checked out!!! There were not enough servers on staff to accommodate the crowds. On a strong note,  the buffet is one of the best in Vegas and cost is absolutely reasonable compared to the competition. When I mentioned this to the room service staff responsible, they smiled and said oh really? Particularly, there was a server in the café bar who went above and beyond to provide top level service (I wish I could remember her name)! This is obviously a very popular hotel however they do not have their guests best interests at heart. I loved that the hotel and our rooms were very clean, and our beds comfortable. Had a great stay, good position, room roomly and very clean serviced very well. The room was comfortable, there was so much to do onsite, all the staff was helpful. This was my first Vegas vacation and the MGM Grand was all that I could ask for. Many other things wrong with this hotel which made our wedding anniversary stay a shambles and rip off . The grand buffet after 9pm was leftovers only - nothing replenished and roasts all overdone by that time and unpalatable. Only downfall was the check in lines were always long and the hold on my credit card has not been returned as yet But it would have been too much trouble to get dressed again, get all our belongings packed up, etc. With more than ten restaurants on site, including the award-winning Joel Robuchon, guests can never go hungry here. This sort of thing happens but its not acceptable we were in the Casino. I travel 6 times a year so I'm familiar with hotels, this hotel failed. Buffet queue was at least 1 hour every night - unless maybe if you started queuing for dinner at 4pm. West wing carpets in hallway and bedroom were filthy.No tea making facilities in room.Resort fees definately a rip off.Most dissapointing vacation. They don't have any type of grip in the shower and I nearly slipped more than once. The positives were:  *Quick and Easy check in and clean room. We went and checked out that's when they charged us an extra 130 bucks for resort fees. But staff came and (sufficiently) fixed the blinds, and the furniture was comfortable. There’s a variety of treatment options at the in-house spa. The hotel features four swimming pools with a number of cabanas. Some of the younger front desk staff were very rude and short, when we requested a room change after our room started to smell like bad pot for 2 days. The service while you were playing slots or cards was lacking. It was a dark room and it wasn't even a king bed it was a queen bed! Experience was ok but way to expensive for the price. The location is perfect for all the activities the strip offers. This was our first stay at the MGM and we really enjoyed everything. Hotels.com, I can get pictures from the video, just let me know if you want me to add pictures later.) Unexplained and surprise charges and explained the special meaning behind trip and sustained avoidable inconvenient obstacles and charges. There’s no towel bar near the shower and no ledge or shelves in the shower, making it hard to shave or store toiletries. They ended up not charging us for the resort fee for our entire stay. NEVER will enter that hotel again or recommend it to anyone! Important thing to understand is that you will stand in line for everything except to gamble and no value for money for the rooms. The room was nice but hallway was very loud and in the middle of the night we were woken up because our whole room smelled like pot from another room. Took 24 hours before repair person told us it was fixed.
This time it happened to be literally right outside our room window. We were woken up just about EVERY HOUR by the loudest noise come from our radiator. We called to cancel our 3 night stay with Hotels.com to get a refund and the hotel would only authorize the 2nd and 3rd nights for a refund even though we had to stay in a room with no heat, a very, very tiny room at that. Mille-Feuille Café is located on site, and serves French pastries with fresh coffee and a selection of teas. Excellent walking location for anywhere in the Upper West Side. Tea etc were free in the hotel lobby which was good after a day of siteseeing. A walk across the bedroom floor in your socks or barefeet would result in the bottom of your feet becoming dark gray within a matter of moments. Guests can get to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in just over two kilometres during their stay at this hotel. Guests can also walk to Levain Bakery in just five minutes. The hotel is not in the main hub of the busy area, which was fine for us, but possibly not if you want to be right in the heart of everything. The staff went out of their way to get us a special room and everything we needed to have a great stay. The little restaurant inside the hotel does not have many choices. 2) I needed to print some tickets off from StubHub and the internet was down beyond the hotel’s control but there was active internet with the check-in desk computers. Pillows, bolster and bed throw are stuffed in a corner, no additional shampoo/conditioner/soap so use sparingly according to how many days you are there or bring your own. When I asked if they would allow me to login and print the tickets they said no because it was against the Manager’s policy to allow guests to use the lobby computers and that I’d have to use the Business Center which they admitted didn’t work. Just so small from the elevators to rooms to hallways. You had the option to upgrade but it was so slow - it struggled to load google maps and had to switch to lite mode (which I've never seen before). My deluxe room and the bed were small and the heater clanked all night, not good if you're a light sleeper. We got no apologies or anything for our terrible stay. I will still recommend this hotel as everything else was positive. The hotel is in a good location, with easy access to subway. Location is great ,  walking to Central Park and MOMA. When I pulled back the sheet to perform my routine bed bug check (everyone should do this in every single hotel to avoid bringing those monsters back to your home. The next morning we stopped by the front desk to explain our concerns and they said their engineer would stop by in which he did. No closet, no place to hang clothing, no place to set a suitcase, unless it was on the floor, in which case one would have to teleport around the room. When I went down for hot tea they only had ice tea (40° outside) and made no attemp to heat water for the hot tea. The room was just right for my grandson and I. Nice and very clean bedding and towels, excellent robes and slippers provided. We were at the front of the hotel which was so noisy we didn't sleep. On a caution side: very old window frames with poor noise protection, if you are a light sleeper do not take city view room. They had no other rooms to move me to so we slept in our clothes and in the morning trekked across the street to the Beacon Hotel and stayed there. The hotel has a small, but cool lobby & the property has a boutique-style ambience. Little disappointed that none of the front door staff helped me unload my luggage from my car. Conveniently located only a short stroll to 79th St Subway, so easy to get to most places quite quickly. No lamp on bed side table, had to use overhead bad light. The room was lovely and spacious, clean and comfortable beds. The bathroom was recently renovated and while small, it was perfectly serviceable and clean. Loved the coffee, baking and complimentary hot cocoa and tea in the evenings! My only complaint is that housekeeping did not clean/refresh our room. If I have one complaint, it's really about the volume of the noise coming from the old radiator-style heater in the room. That being said it is a nice location if you're going to the Beacon Theater. The rooms are small, and ours was very warm--we couldn't figure out how to cool it down-- but the beds were comfortable, the shower worked OK (hot and cold water vacillated in the morning..) and the room was clean. Room is half made up; they make the bed and refresh the linens. If I were to visit New York again I certainly would not return to this hotel. Excellent restaurant and bar recommendations from the front desk staff. Window not double glazed but fairly quiet except the sirens. Fortunately, another staff member allowed me to use the lobby computer to print my tickets. My wife and I stayed at Hotel Belleclaire for a combined business trip and anniversary getaway. Room was clean and very pleasant and remarkably quiet despite being across from the elevators. Front desk staff also gave us menus for places that deliver to this hotel as well!!! we were on on the 3rd floor on the far right, there was a lot of constant noise from the hotels main air con unit, which is probably the only negative comment I have. i would just suggest that when you check in, make sure the hot water works before you unpack! Nothing wrong with the hotel but I wouldn’t go back. Very friendly staff, Very clean would definitely recommend to a friend. The heat in the tiny room was not working and the bed was against the radiator. There was a draught from the window none of which are double glazed. Stayed for a week and I loved how close it was to amentities. We would definitely stay at the Belle Claire again BUT only in at least a Queen size room. Only down fall is no hot tub or pool to relax your legs after all the walking. At bed time it became glaringly apparent that the walls were paper thin as I heard every whispered conversation, TV commercial and bodily function imaginable emanating from the rooms and hallway around me. Central Park Zoo is located three kilometres away and Beacon Theatre is four minutes away on foot. We had a cleaner who made our beds and changed the towels each day, however they were clearly not paid to dust as the amount of dust covering the room was appalling! Pictures on website make the rooms look big, they're not. This hotel is very close to central park and all of the wonderful NY museums-- the location is PERFECT. Our room was slightly bigger than most affordable NYC hotel rooms, which was surprising; we were on the 2nd floor. We stayed almost a week and got used to it but it was very noisy. I think the hotel needs to invest in some Anderson style double pain windows because the vintage windows, with blinds and shutters do not shield the occupant from street noise at all - we could hear conversations 7 stories down, cars, building workers across the street, fire engines from a block away, etc. Guests staying at Hotel Belleclaire can make use of the computers in the media lounge, connect to free high-speed Wi-Fi, and read the daily newspaper. I know some of this looks petty but when you’re paying so much money, it’s the “little” things that bring us back. My daughter & I both enjoyed our stay in New York. The waiting area and the rest it's all in the same place as the only (very small only fits 4 people if the luggage are small) elevator. Valet parking is $55 with tax for 24hrs which is good in this part of town. Great location, subway is a 2 minute walk, and Times Square only 4 stops, great staff and very clean, old decor just adds character to the hotel. nice personal hotel-rooms are small but comfortable and clean-staff are lovely-helpful.easy walk to central park and very close to the subway -would be happy to stay there again. Someone from the front desk came up and banged on the radiator and said it would go on but it never did. We stay here often and would recommend this boutique hotel The location is great if you want to be near Central Park, a subway station and away from the busier parts of Manhattan. Belleclaire is located on a side street on the Upper West Side. The only negative I would have for the hotel was the size of the room we stayed in and the lack of wifi access from our hotel room. Walking distance to Central Park in a relatively quiet neighborhood. Room was a little dusty.. windows had smudges, but over all, a clean room. In a small room, the noise felt amplified, and hard to sleep to. The water was too cold to even try to shower. The reception and lobby are personal, and the staff is very hospitable. Do not get excited about the pictures you see when booking as the rooms, although comfortable are way too smaller than expected. Nice size room.. quiet room street side on 7th floor. While the stay was alright, the overall experience was not what I would expect from the cost per night per room. Subway is right there, and cross town bus (to get to east side of central park) is right near by, and there are great restaurants and 4 supermarkets in a 3 block radius. The Belleclaire is a fine hotel in an excellent location. We arrived late at night and there was no engineering staff. Consumer Reports has an excellent story about how to check for them, FYI) I discovered the bed was literally covered from top to bottom with stray hairs of ever color, thickness and length. I would suggest to have breakfast at the Europa bakery (Broadway between 77th and 78th). Maybe we did something bad in a prior life and this was payback. Basically it was “ oh well, sorry.” It’s too bad... Clean room ,private bathroom ,centrally located near amc movie theater, cvs,duane reede and budget friendly eateries. There is also a meeting room on the tenth floor. Upon check-in, the hotel appeared to be in good condition and the room was well cleaned and neat. All staff were friendly and would go that extra mile. Not fun to wake up to hammering and such (excuses were made but would not move us). All good except we never received our requested wake-up call. Tiny room, no heating ,air condition functional system, 5-10 minutes before hot water arrives, not one chair. Our room was spacious & comfortable and came with a mini fridge and free wi-fi. The 79th subway station is two blocks up Broadway the staff is friendly and helpful as are the nice people at the coffee bar, if sensitive to noise a caution it’s not soundproof and my room was cozy The location of this hotel is great for our needs but they always seem to be under some sort of construction. My only negatives would be the steam radiators were a little noisy and we missed having tea/coffee making facility in the room for our early morning cuppa, however there was complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby in the evenings from 6pm. The staff at the front desk were not that apologetic and didn’t offer any discount or refund. Only down fall windows were very drifty due to AC unit in the window . The location of the hotel was perfect for us -the upper west side. it's convenient to a nearby subway stop, there are shops and restaurants nearby and Central Park and several museums are in walking distance. Hotel needs a little room updating, however room had everything we needed and close to transport, local subway couple of blocks away on 72nd Street. We chose the hotel, though, because of it's proximity to the finish line. View was brick wall 1 ft away from dirty window. I have to say, I would think twice about staying there again, if only because of the noise. We didn't really use the hotel staff for anything (b/c it was a family trip) but they seemed nice enough. It is clean and the bedrooms are very well designed. The hotel is situated in a lovely neighborhood with a front desk staffed with efficient, caring and attentive employees. I really just found it weird and bad form that I had to spend 15 minutes figuring out what to do before another staff member would allow me to print the tickets. The staff are very helpful, you're in a nice area, the rooms are very clean and it's a smart place to rest your head each night. The halls and room are a little dated but tidy enough, the room was of an adequate size (Deluxe Queen Room) The aircon unit stuck in the window with plastic wrap filling the gaps was a rather scruffy, but not a big deal. I asked for a wakeup call and was assured it would happen. The staff was extremely friendly & helpful when we needed to store our bags the next day. Within Walking distance to AMC theaters, pleasant Restaurant and Cafes and there is also some shopping in the area; great neighborhood an overall pleasant experience, and yes I would stay here again. We were staying overnight for the NYC Half Marathon, and had to get up the next morning at 4:30 to start our trek to the Brooklyn starting line, and I have to be honest, it was hard to sleep with the noise. Since the moment we walked in until we checked out the staff and overall experience was fantastic. We had a wonderful stay in New York last week and the hotel was very comfortable and staff were always there to help and also carry suitcases etc. The lobby bathroom also struggled to flush, so not ideal. If you are looking for a basic hotel just to sleep in then this will be ok. we were a party of two couples and booked two rooms, ourselves had emailed two months beforehand to see if we were able to upgrade to a city view as at the time there was availability, when we arrived our view couldn't have been worse - back of a building and noisy fans - which kept us awake during the night! There are many places to choose from for great drinks and food very near the hotel. We had a free upgrade to a parlour suite which was a lovely surprise. Don't forget to claim your free hot drink after 2pm (I think) from the lobby as there is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. The hotel is conveniently located in the UWS near lots of great restaurants, shops & several subway stations. We did peek into another room across the hall, which seemed considerably more spacious. Other than that it was a good place to stay. I had a nice stay I was very happy with the location easy walking distance east to American Museum  And Central Park many great shopping and dining options close. Nice clean hotel close to public transport and walking distance to Central Park and the Museum of Natural History. The door man seems to take a lot of breaks because I hardly ever saw him there. The location is close (walking distance) to museums and very near the the train station... if adventure is your thing! A standard double room was tiny, no wardrobe and one bedside table. Would visit again but would not be top of the list and would choose another hotel over this one. Overall if you are in NY to enjoy  the city great find at reasonable price. Fridge in bedroom was useful for putting in our drinks etc. The clerk told us that there was hot chocolate and tea availble in the lobby... no coffee (only in the morning at cost). That particularly great service (definitely not rude, but also not very helpful). our friends who booked the same style of room as us were less than impressed with the size and broken bathroom, reception offered to move them the following day when a room became available which was helpful, however it was to the same standard with a working bathroom. Rooms are clean if you do not move the furniture. Unfortunately, our two night stay here was a nightmare at night. Also would not stay there at stay there in summer, air conditioner system looks quite outdated. After complaining to front desk, manager went out of his way to make sure remaining service was fantastic!! We managed to work out a fix that sometimes did the trick. Had to ask for valet service to take our car once I got inside hotel with luggage. Booked the hotel because of its strong reviews rating it 4/5. Enjoyedmystayat the Belleclaire.Wouldhave beennice tohave had coffee andtea makingfacilitiesinthe room. We stayed for three nights because we were visting family for the weekend, and they live near by. I believe that hot chocolate also uses hot water, so no hot chocolate either. Room is very small...you get the real old New York feel. However, he ultimately told us it was nothing he could do and we would have to suffer through. After reading some of the reviews I didn't know what to expect. Rooms at Hotel Belleclaire come standard with a writing desk, slippers, as well as a flat-screen TV and docking stations for in-room entertainment. Windows are only single glazed and street noise is noticeable at night. Amsterdam Ale house was the nearest bar which was OK and the cafe breakfast bar opposite side of Broadway was quite pleasant. CVS (pharmacy and groceries) just a few steps away and opened 24 hours. There is a cozy first floor area which is a great place to sit, talk with friends, and enjoy the complimentary afternoon tea. I like that it was away from the loud midtown area. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size... no oversized tub. Lack of tea/ coffee facilities in the room was another downer although tea and hot chocolate was complimentary in the lobby. My only issues was the shower and the lack of hot water. A very nice quaint boutique type hotel with a French flair. But we were so exhausted after a day of walking the city he didn't miss it. I was told that I received an upgrade with a view, but I would have needed a big enough window to see a view. Hotel has a good quality lobby and reception area, staff were very polite and attentive. In night, light came thru room  door ...apparently wrong size. They don't have Central AC, only window unit which made a lot of noise. We opened the pull out mattress and found dirty, slept in sheets, underneath the springs were popping through the mattresses! Staff woman at front front desk gave my 4 year old a coloring book and crayons upon check in as well !!! They promptly brought a shower chair to our room and installed temporary grab bars in the shower. The window above the dust encrusted AC unit was literally held in place by molding, wet packing tape. Took walk to Central Park which was close to hotel. We were a family of 5 and were delighted to find a suite with 3 beds at an affordable price in a lovely hotel. Located only an eight-minute walk from the American Museum of Natural History, Hotel Belleclaire features a 24-hour fitness centre and views of the Hudson River. All of the staff we met were lovely and we couldn't fault the location, lovely and quiet but only a 15 min walk from the hustle and bustle of Times Square it is an older building so it's tougher to judge things like cleanliness and comfort.For instance the steam heating hisses and is difficult to adjust. While a beautiful building itself, the rooms need updating (peeling faux-leather headboard, very old a/c, loud mini-fridge). My room was comfortable, I could watch people and traffic on Broadway from my window.I experienced a problem with the door lock and they were very quick to give me another room so they could work on the lock. So when the doors open you are faced with a big crowed of people. We upgraded to a Queen size room for an additional 15 dollars a night, but it was essential. The toilet in our room did not flush at all and they were unable to help us because this came about late at night. I stayed here with my daughter for the NYC half marathon for two nights & was overall delighted with our stay. Nice people work the hotel and it's in a great location to explore the Upper West Side I likely won't be back- but if you don't mind cramped, dirty quarters with no sound insulation, you might consider this place if they're running a very good sale. Took subway & bus to all the sights we wanted to see. The bed took up 90% of the room and it was tricky to navigate around the little refrigerator on the floor just to get to the bathroom. This lovely small boutique hotel is in a quiet residential area near to Central Park. The hotel was about a 10 min drive from Times Square (without traffic). It's a beautiful building - historic and quaint - but, unfortunately, the room assigned to us was absurd. Small lobby and elevators but very charming and great location for our Columbia University graduation activities. I do not recommend a standard double to anyone, not even a single traveller. At 4 am I called down to the front desk and which he came up and turned the radiator off supposedly but the noise kept coming back! I think the hotel also has apartments, some of the people staying there were super shady. The Belleclaire was a comfortable and chic oasis on the Upper West Side, close to the subway and a few blocks from Central Park. Two quick examples: 1) I’m not overly sensitive but I heard a staff member drop the f-bomb in the lobby which I just found unprofessional and in general there seems to be less professional demeanor with the staff than at other similarly priced hotels. In all fairness, I did not call to report this to the front desk, but their response to this matter upon check out was one of concern. By the time of our check-out, we were ecstatic to leave. Excellent value and friendly staff.It's also only 2 blocks from the subway. I was impresses with the cleanliness for the room I stayed in. I booked this hotel at 246p 2/20/18 and literally checked in 14 mins later. The bed, however, was as hard as a rock and filthy. Our friends on the fifth & sixth floors noted that their rooms were not as big, so keep that in mind. Not a good use of my money....Very disappointed in travelocity & hotel. The elevators fit 4 adults comfortably... so no rush up or down. Walking distance to the Museum of Natural History, subway, restaurants and grocery stores. The only disappointment was the game room was not operational. Our room was quiet and clean, but it was one of the smallest rooms i’ve seen as a double. Elevator was small, I'm a bit claustrophobic but managed to use it.
Needed a roll away cot and was told it was a fire code. I had to turn on the thermostat for short periods of time to freshen up the air in the room. At check in we were told there would be renovations in the morning starting 9am. These extra charges were not shown on the Expedia website. This was a very nice perk to have and the offerings were quite generous. I was very upset to find out the the hotel was under construction during my stay. There was also no sheets in the pullout bed,I had to call the front desk for a set. Also had we had relatives come over they would have had to pay $7/hr or $20 all day parking. They were having renovations between 9am-6pm, but I didn't notice any noise or disruptions. The hotel was very nice and clean and all the staff was very friendly. I'm not trying to complain but if these two things were changed this hotel would get 5 stars from me. However, on the day of my trip they sent me a text that stated our room was no longer available. The room, friendly staff & amenities were all comparable to the Marriott but the cost was less. The staff working the check in desk was not helpfull nor did they even seem to care when i asked them questions refurding my room. The room given to us had a door to the adjacent room (which is weird). I asked them in advance for a roll away bed for our three year old but that was not there when we checked in. I traveled often, this is the 1st time the hotel will charge me on internet service. I would recommend this hotel to anyone willing to drive 10 minuets to the beach! I requested a change in room type and they were very accommodating. Or, as the receptionist recommended: You can go to the gas station across the street. We had access to the business lounge and its complementary breakfast, snacks and drinks. A new restaurant just opened -- although we did not try it, the atmosphere was very pleasing. I moved to the Hampton Inn, one block away, and got all of the above at no charge, including an exceptionally good free breakfast. Marriott San Diego Del Mar Hotel features a heated outdoor swimming pool and a whirlpool for guests to enjoy downtown, while daily housekeeping, on-site parking and a concierge service is also available. It was the worse when I had to check out. I appreciate the attention to detail and going the extra mile. The Del Mar Horse Track is just 4.4 miles from this hotel, while other local attractions such as Del Mar City Beach and Mount Soledad are within close driving distance. Arterra Sushi Bar is open for dinner and is known for its fresh sashimi-grade seafood. Each PURE allergy-friendly guest room features luxurious amenities such as a flat screen TV, mini fridge, work desk and free toiletries in the private bathroom. The sound proofing between the suites could be improved, this wasn't a problem on the weekdays, but on the weekend I think there were kids on a school trip next door and they were playing loud music/tv until 1am when I finally called the front desk. Very good hotel but a bit outdated in terms of facilities and appliances We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.I was excited to stay at any hotel in San Diego hoping I would open the windows and enjoy the fresh ocean breeze. A new BMW or Mercedes really doesn't warrant breaking fire code.... a Bugatti Chiron maybe. One more thing, for the price the hotel charges per night (breakfast, parking, internet, fridge not included), they could have had a hand shower head (with hose). This was the first hotel I have ever stayed in that didn't have a complimentary breakfast. If there had been a window to open in the room, we would have had a nicer stay. Another thing I don't like is when valets park cars in the fire lane in front of hotels. I will say that the staff in the resturant was extremely helpfull and curtious. This hotel charges for Wi-Fi, coffee in the lobby, parking & breakfast (full American breakfast starts at $18). When talking with the staff about some concerns the response from the staff was oh. Great pool... even though the room marked locker room had no lockers, showers, benches or tables... it was just a bathroom. The pool and fire pits were a cozy and relaxing touch! The restaurant is a bit pricey, but the food was quite tasty. The location was less than 10 minutes away from the area we were visiting to check out San Diego's breweries. The suite had just been remodeled and looked very nice, everything worked. After a slight mistake, the staff went above and beyond to make my stay special. Oh and the construction was not suposse to start until 9am but yet I we woken up at 6am by banging! For short periods of time because the air draft from the AC was strong and I simply could not sit on the bed next to the window. Very Sad   we were looking so forward for  this trip.. If you are a rewards member, Wi-Fi is free so you can join at the time you check in . When we arrived the view from our room was of a roof, leaking and the bathroom smelled like smoke and the hotel front desk said they couldn’t move us so I called Expedia and then they moved us 2doors down with the same view, not what I envisioned for a hotel in Del Mar/San Diego romantic Valentines getaway weekend with my spouse, very disappointing. It would have helped a lot when giving a bath to a baby. My daughter ended up building a bed out of the sofa right next to our bed which she enjoyed. One of my children had to sleep on the floor! I consider the quality of the bed and the shower the only two mandatories for a hotel. The strong smell of air freshener (not a pleasant one) was very present. And the parking garage was very inconvenient; the exit wasn't working half the time and we had to sit there for 10 minutes before we could leave. Arterra Restaurant is located on-site and features an award-winning food and wine program, open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The air conditioner was not working and the bed was hard,also the water was not hot. Executive lounge was not accessible on weekends, making working there more difficult. This Hotel could use some staff training on providing great customer service.. The hotel was very nice along with a spacious room. Tea and coffee making facilities are also available in each room. Was booked  for four nights but stayed only one because of unbearable noise from construction on the floors above me. Situated near Torrey Pines and just 20 minutes from downtown San Diego, Marriott San Diego Del Mar Hotel features several meeting rooms for guests on business and a fully equipped fitness center. Will never stay atbthis hotel again and quite frankly may never stay at a Marriot again! I was pretty disappointed to find out that I would not be able to open the  window. The hotel recently went through renovations so was clean and updated. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend and I will not stay at this hotel in the future. After sitting in traffic for a few hours, this was just what the doctor ordered. Restaurant was okay, but focused on trendiness rather than quality. I chose this hotel because it was conveniently located half way between Legoland and the Zoo. There was bo worning prior to my check in warning of this or i would have chossen a diffrent hotel. Room service food was overpriced and their attempt at chicken noodle soup was seriously hard peas. The bed was a little uncomfortable but the price we paid and the free breakfast made up for it. The $20 daily parking rate seems excessive given the suburban setting. However, you could purchase Cola at the check-in desk for $3. We went to eat breakfast and I ordered oatmeal, my husband an omelet and both my sons ordered cereal. We had a one night stay at the Marriott in Del Mar for an event. Due to construction on the upper floor we did not get a king size bed but to queen. The receptionist told me that they were short staffed that night and there was no one available to check it out. if you like the beach its fine, not much around but corporate buildings. We stayed at Hotel Indigo gas lamp Awesome place and they could teach the Marriott team how to provide a Great customer experience.... Will stay here again when I come back to Del Mar. The room was clean and the bed was so comfy.
They like to clean at about the same time each day - for us it was around 3:30. There is public parking across the street for $1.00/hr from 0900 to 1800. Reason, I gave it a lower score on comfort  was due to the shower... it barely gave any water pressure and was not even luke warm. Area dining spots include Juicy Gyros, Sazon Cuban Cuisine and Cholo’s On The Beach. Double sinks, though lots of splashing Love that there's a sofa between the 2 queen beds and front of tv  Love that it has a combo washer dryer in unit  Just a short block walk to beach We were on the first level and had loud neighbors above us which was the only draw back. By the way, the weather was wonderful at the time of our stay from March 29 - April 6. Parking is very bad the bed broke on me the staff was friendly. I really feel that the selling of this hotel was misleading. We got two rooms since we had 5 people total. I would only stay here again if we needed the space. The staff was friendly although most of them spoke Spanish better than English, which sometimes resulted in misunderstanding. We had a lovely room with two comfy queen beds and a couch (sofa bed). It is a quick walk to the beach and the hotel had beach towels and chairs you can use. The room was nice and smaller, great for a quick, inexpensive  stay. They claim they have free parking , well not really . As to information, I wish there were more brochures, leaflets, etc. If you want entertainment or shopping, you have to take a bus to South Beach or book a hotel there. On checking in we were told we were in a “close by”. The studio apt was nice, spacious, and clean, but some of the housekeepers cleaned it better than others. Night manager Aliasitir on duty on 12/19/2017 was very helpful and fabulous with helping me print out my airline ticket! When we checked in, they gave us a renovated room. The outside of the hotel looks like an old apartment building but the rooms are clean, roomy, and comfortable. I love free parking and you can park 10 feet away from your room, saves a lot of time. Satellite hotel we stayed at was a little further from town then we would have liked, but they do provide transportation between their hotels I arrived late and was told that the AC will be clean out, I only noticed how filthy that room was the next day, and since it was only 2 night stay I really had not time to switch hotels.They did fix the AC odor the next day  but the room still wasn't cleaned proper. They also have some items for convenience such as beach chairs and although we didn't check it out they offered that we stop at some of their other hotels for free drinks between certain times of day. Staff is rude and unfriendly behaving like they doing you a favor by letting you stay at Seaside. There are two buildings so you may have to walk to the other building (across the street) to use the pool. Looks can be deceiving, the room is a lot nicer than the outside look of the building. It was about 25 minutes from South beach which I loved, because we didn’t have to deal with the traffic and crowds. The management must have hired a good photographer because I assure you, this place looks nothing like pictures. Emailed guest relations following my trip to let them know about the bedbugs and broken window on 1/29/18. hotel has few parking spots so if they are taken you have to park on a street. Kitchen/paper towels are not included and neither is coffee, so make sure you bring/buy coffee and coffee filters. The rooms were quite large, and had laundry, stove, fridge, and even some dishes and silverware. staff was very helpful and room was spacious and clean. By close by they meant 8 blocks north and 1 block further from the beach! Given the size of the room, it would be possible to put drawers there. The location is perfect for those who are interested in staying on the beach and taking evening walks on the seafront. There is a washer/dryer in the kitchenette; if you plan to do laundry, make sure you bring or buy laundry detergent. Those two who spoke good English were very helpful in providing directions and information about tours. If you get a spot by the hotel, try to keep it. There was a group of very noisy guests who were partying in the small courtyard with loud music into the early hours with no one from the hotel to reign in their behaviour. Parking isn't good, but not bad if considering the public parking lot. That location was also further from the beach than where we thought we would be. The room was ok but it was a small complex with no pool and the distance to the main hotel ruled out going for a quick dip! We were happy until we realized that we where in fact ten blocks down the road, with no parking and no pool. So you'd have to call the front desk from your cell or walk to their office for any issues. Seaside apartments were newly renovated and check-in was simple easy. This three-star complex features 40 studio apartments and limited free parking. Booked this hotel based on location and the fact it had a small pool. We booked this hotel because it mentionnés it had parking and a pool. Tried to cancel and they refused  was not anything like advertised. The room had a strong mold like odor and AC was blowing out air that smelled like urine. Got relocated when we got to the hotel to another building they owned which was seven blocks further. There were a dozen bites on necks and on limbs all together. Plus, guests can enjoy the garden and take advantage of on-site concierge services. Great experience will recomend and stay again.Service was excellent beach,stores and restruants in walking distance. This hotel is close to the beach and market, which is helpful if you want to prepare food in your room. Only one has a pool and only one has a parking. There was a little difficulty keeping the room at a constant cool temp, but we worked it out. This is a 2 star motel with a price of a 4 star hotel. Thoroughly enjoyed the large room with a kitchen area and comfortable leather couch. When I called to complain about the noise next door at 11pm, I was told by front desk that they were busy at the moment, but will try to stop by next door or send them an email. Overall, the experience was great, so I can recommend the hotel. There were enough hangers for dresses or pants, but we had to keep little things and clothes items in our suitcases. Bottom line there are plenty of places to rent  in Miami and no self respecting human being should stay at Seaside . We could use the pool at the other location without any problem, but still, it wasn’t has convenient has we imagined. the outside does look kinda sketchy but the room was nice and clean. Seaside Apartment Hotel, a South Beach Group Hotel is dreadful. Really it should be marketed as a separate entity at its own location with a clear description of the amenities (or lack of them) available. The room was very clean, designed and plenty of open space. Hotel looked clean and neat at first until I got bitten by bedbugs on multiple places overnight. Opening in 2015, the Seaside All Suites Hotel in Miami’s North Beach places guests near the Normandy Shores Golf Club and the Indian Creek Country Club. What it did not say is that this hotel is in fact 3 buildings. The Seaside All Suites Hotel lies six miles from South Beach, eight miles from the Ancient Spanish Monastery, 16 miles from Miami Seaquarium and a 30-minute drive from Miami International Airport. With a max occupancy of four guests, apartments provide two queen beds with Egyptian cotton sheets and pillowtop mattresses, full kitchens (with washer/dryer), 42” plasma TVs with satellite channels and high-speed Internet. The room we had was spacious, but make sure you save a picture of the room you reserved and paid for... the check in staff tried to stick us is a a smaller room. Facilities include a business centre, free newspapers and a 24-hour front desk. The staff at the front desk was really nice and helpful, especially Jen, except the guy who worked the afternoon shift was a total jerk. Try to be out of the room, not taking a nap:) The pool is small but fine for a quick dip. I wish I had brought some, because I could not find small packaging in the nearby stores. Overall our stay was peaceful, comfortable and quite at seaside! For sure all the good reviews that have are totally fake. Saw before and they would not allow cancel  charged full stay The check in process was not great  parking was worst... but for the price and location you can over look those small issues. It is located in a bad area of Miami with dirty street and filthy beach. The washing machine is a bit odd, as it’s european style. Area wasn't pretty but it was close to the beach. There is a kitchen with pots, dishes, silverware, small fridge, small sink, toaster, microwave, two burner hotplate and 4-cup coffee maker (we did not use it). The beach is about ten minutes easy walk from the hotel. Wonderful location - close to food stores and bakery, band shell, and the beach.
Nice hotel on the marina with shuttle to a quiet beach I did not eat at the restaurant, but ate at Ruth's Chris right next door, just a quick walk to the next building. Even after I told her my family stays here every year. It was fun while it lasted, but this place is more for conferences and others, not so much for regular guests. I expressed my unhappiness at checkout on Friday morning, and the lady working behind the desk, COULDN’T CARE LESS. I found the reception staff very helpful as my golf clubs where misplaced at one of the golf courses we played at. The condo is much bigger than we were expecting and everything is perfectly maintained and clean! A tip is to use the free shuttle to the beach as they provide beach chairs and umbrellas. They didn't even try to accommodate me as the they looked at us with rude faces and ask. We requested and we were granted a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite with a fireplace overlooking the Marina and the golf course...a beautiful room!! would you like me to refund your money as if our money wasn't good enough there. Very home-like, enough room for everyone- we were a group of 7. Friendly staff and helpful nice surroundings and good views of the canal and harbor It was a real treat staying here after staying at the average hotel. We stayed two nights for a beach vacation & had a fantastic time. I advised numerous times that I did not want a double queen as i didn't need 2 queen beds in my room. Hotel is located in a convenient place away from the crowded areas byt still close to everything. All staff met my high standard for courtesy and helpfulness. It had a great bar and room was clean and comfortable. When we got there they told me that they had no more King bed available and there was only 1 double queen room left available in the whole hotel. The Marina Inn is my favorite hotel in Myrtle Beach and I highly recommend it to those seeking that perfect hideaway with someone special... we enjoyed everything about the hotel but the waterview that I was promised was a lie Although you can go down to lobby for complimentary coffee). It was a nice  looking property, hotel and room service was great too. They told us they would have to reset a table for dinner, we ate at a local resultant. Upon checking in I requested late checkout, let’s just say I was asked to leave serveral times on my day to checkout. Don’t be deceived by the pictures of the beachfront, there is none! The interior was great and the staff was so helpful and friendly. Hopefully they will have the indoor pool temp corrected by then! I was hoping to have a relaxing time in the hot tub, so I was disappointed when I stepped into cold water. We stayed at The Marina Inn due to its close proximity to The Carolina Opry and were surprised by the value. We’ve stayed at the Marina Inn four straight years for our kids Spring Break. I could take it for about 5 minutes and then moved to the sauna. Great location with easy in and out on the highway. Good stay....The 2 bedroom suit was nice, the view was great, the food was great. The hotel staff did exactly the right thing and that level of service is difficult to find these days. We did meet a few families who told us that summers at this location are amazing, so I wouldn't rule it out for a future trip. The property is well maintained and they offered valet services. We are a family of 5 so we got a 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite. Nice place to go and relax stuff are very nice . The location is a little out from the main town of Myrtle Beach (10 mins drive) but suited us as was nice a quite and as it is on highway 17 made it easy to get to everywhere we needed. Spent our last night in South Carolina at this hotel. The room wasn’t serviced on Saturday while I was out. I was very satisfied with the condition of the vacation rental. The hotel was centrally located to the boardwalk, beach and convention center. Myrtle Beach, Broadway at the Beach and Alabama Theater are all in close proximity to the inn. I called the hotel to to make sure that we were clear for a late check in. We were greated  quickly and courteously upon our arrival. The first time we ended up leaving, the second time, the chef let us in and asked that we be seated. Those were the two features I was most anxious to use for our trip, and unfortunately ended up being the most underwhelming. You can have your morning coffee or afternoon cocktail watching the sailboats go by. Room service didn't come by as often as desired for cleaning. This hotel is on a river with some cool boats to look at, the beachfront is a shuddle drive away 9am-5pm only. Horrible experience with food- all I was told when we returned the salad with slime in it that “no problem- I haven’t put it in your tab yet so we won’t charge you.”  The fireplace didn’t work - ice maker didn’t work. It’s across the street from the opry and the hotel had beautiful views of the waterway, grande dunes golf, and the marina. The Marina Inn is a beautiful, warm, classy hotel away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to everywhere to be the perfect hideaway especially for couples and those looking for an intimate escape. Very nice place Would recommend to anyone  Great view and nice accommodations There were not enough glasses, cereal bowls, and only a few pots. I don't see why it took 3 staff members to help that couple find a room in their hotel but we couldn't get what we asked for. It isn't on the beach, but they offer a shuttle to take you to their private beach minutes away. The bath mat towel was wet,so i dont think it was replaced from the previous guests. Favorite hotel in Myrtle Beach (unless I’m at my Marriott Time share) but come a few times a year and this is my hotel of choice. Pros: Clean, pleasant staff, 24 hr valet service, nice restaurants in and around the marina, spacious rooms, nice view, all around wonderful stay. The views are amazing as they overlook the pool / marina and golf course. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, almost as comfortable as our own bed. The only issue I had was that the indoor pool/hot tub was COLD. So looking forward to our next stay there and I'm already sharing the experience with my friends and family so that they can enjoy it to. The outside pool area is lovely, with plenty of lounge chairs and beautiful foliage. We had plenty of room and the two balconies were great! If we were to have even received a FAKE apology or expression of concern from ANY member of the staff, I’d overlook how bad of an experience this trip was. My boyfriend and I checked in  late and we got a upgrade to the suit. Apparently room service was busy while we were gone during the day. At 11am, when asking how long the room will be ready, he did not try to find out instead of saying from now till 4pm. A little ways from beaches, but very nice location and golf. The rooms are beautifully done, the beds and bedding amazingly comfy and the small sitting area in the lobby has comfortable cushy chairs clustered about looking on to a roaring fireplace on colder nights. My only complaint would be the lack of water pressure in the shower. Private beach shuttle service is only on the weekends and only 9am-5pm. Its also very close to the Pirates Voyage and Broadway at the Beach. Waterscapes offers a wide range of seasonal dishes made from locally sourced produce as well as freshly prepared breakfasts. The atmosphere and feel of it was so grande, we couldn't have picked a more perfect spot. The rooms feature flat-screen TV’s, coffee makers, hairdryers, desks, safes, minifridges, air-conditioning units, complimentary toiletries and free Wi-Fi. They had no answer, eventually after 30 minutes, the valet attendant told us we could park in his lot. For the price, I’d rather pay more or the same and stay across the street at the Ocean Club or Marriott. I highly recommend this condo and cannot wait to visit again. This is not a good customer service in a 4 star hotel. We stayed for 6 days and nights and the level of customer service commitment was defined the first day. Reviewer Comments: Great location with view of Intercoastal, Marina and Pools! Problem with the wifi in our room no problem connecting with android but not with ipad not sue why. Not saying I wouldn't stay there again because I most definitely would. As we sat there, a white couple who just got married walked in and everyone on the staff stopped what they were during to go get a room for this couple. The pool area was relaxing and featured an infinity pool with zero entry area, 2 hot tubs, and bar area with snacks. We had a view of the 10th hole of the golf course, which made my husband happy! When I tried to explain I requested late checkout upon arrival the front desk person spoke over me and said “sir, I need you to pack yourself and your family and leave ASAP”. Carpet needed serious updating as we could see dirty patches in certain areas of the room. NO PARKING after a long day at the beach and site seeing. There was also a buffet and a dining room table with 4 chairs. Me and my wife spent our 12th anniversary there and our stay was nothing short of spectacular. When we were too tired for the beach, the two on site pools fit the bill nicely. I always know what to expect and am never disappointed. My understanding is this is a new property they are managing so if they make those corrections it would be perfect. As somebody who works in a direct customer service industry, I know that customer service excellence cannot be defined when everything goes exactly right every time. It had everything we could need: washer/dryer, fireplace, 2 bathrooms, full kitchen, huge living room. My only wish was that it would have been better represented that the private beach is only open from Memorial Day to Labor Day and that the indoor pool is not heated. Very wonderful place to stay and the service was outstanding. They also failed to inform the guests that a prom was being held there as well. It is a nice hotel in Myrtle Beach to stay. Courteous and attentive - great experience  - everything was exc Marina Inn at Grande Dunes boasts 230 rooms, two restaurants, a bar/lounge in addition to two swimming pools, two golf courses, spa treatments and a fitness center. But we received no acknowledgement from our concerns and issues. The second bedroom had 2 queen beds with it's own huge attached bath, that is also accessible from the living room. We needed a place to stay while in town to purchase our new home. I would recommend this hotel to anybody at any time. I was satisfied with the condition of the vacation rental. A lighter menu is available at the on-site cafe whilst guests can enjoy an extensive variety of drinks at the bar. She loved the surrounding environment  (closed to shopping and restaurants). We had an issue when we got into our room and once i called the front desk, we had the chief engineer and manager on duty there within minutes. The day we checked in, no one assisted with our luggage. The faculties were too notch (indoor pool, outdoor poo, restaurant and bar on-sight, exercise room, etc)  Our experience was very memorable! John checked us in and completed our reservations to a T. The only drawback was beach access was not at the hotel. I travel alone often and feel very safe in this property. We stayed at he Marina inn at the end of a month long trip and loved it! We got what we expected based on the information available from hotels.com I had to park at the shopping center and walk to the beach. One more  unfortunate part of our experience, our room was only cleaned once while we were there. It was blissfully quiet, spacious  and beautifully set up. Oh one more thing upon arrival, we went to their resurant at 9pm that’s open till 10pm.... let’s just say breakfast was already being set up. They had their beach set up, and were gracious enough to let us use their beach amenities. Hotel's computers were down when we arrived so we couldn't register but they called us when we could get in the room. The master bedroom had 1 king bed with attached master bath with tub, shower, double sinks and plenty of space. An in-house restaurant, Waterscapes, had great food and good service. Always enjoy my stay..feel pampered from the valet to the room quality to the staff willing to go the extra mile. Very clean great staff but for a higher end hotel it needs a little maintenance TLC. It was good, the beds were very hard, we could have used more blankets and the villas should offer napkins and laundry detergent Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the sunset from there. The whole hotel has 2 buildings and i refused to believe that they had no other rooms available. Would have been better if the beach service is extended during summer. The toilet was behind it's own door, a definite plus. My mother was so happy with Marina Inn at Grand Dunes. When I booked the room I booked 1 King bed Grand Room. We were told we could pay if we could find metered parking somewhere else, sad. The large living room area had a fireplace, tv (each bedroom also had a tv), couch, and 3 chairs. Reviewer Comments: We rented this condo for our family of 8 and had a great time. It was a really nice and clean the bathroom was really big. We had one small issue and the rental company handled it immediately. We had a quick stay and didn't get to use any amenities. Our visit was unfortunately at the same time when Hurricane Joaquin was in the area, but having this kind of accommodation made up for the weather. The kitchen had plenty of counter space and cabinets, microwave, full size refrigerator, and dishwasher. Guests  at the Marina Inn at Grande Dunes, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, can practice their golfing skills on the on-site 18-hole course and those looking pamper themselves can choose one of the numerous treatments on offer at the spa. It is exactly as shown except the views are much better in person. This bedroom also had a sliding door to a balcony with 2 chairs and small table that faced an intracoastal waterway and golf course. The only issue I have is I like when the kitchen is a little stocked with basics (dish liquid, garbage bags, a packet of coffee for the morning would be nice. The only bad thing was  the checking  experience, our room wasn't ready at 4pm had to wait 2hours to get in the room.
There are various eateries and pubs within a close range from the hotel. Amenities include a luggage storage and fax/photocopying services, along with a lobby area and a computer. I had a room in the front on the main street, but I heard absolutely nothing. I don't know how they managed to get that room so sound-proof, but I was impressed. hotel clean and staff friendly, a 4 stop underground from city centre, 3 single adults stopping for 3 nights room clean and tidy, bathroom is small as we were all large adults not much room to dry off after having shower. I slept very well and there was plenty of hot water. Walk to Tourist area is about 50 minutes stretch and it is do-able! It used some strange dyn internet guard which blocked half of the sites I tried to open. The location, close to the Keplerplatz subway station, the Hauptbahnhof, and a grocery store was excellent, and the staff was very helpful. The laid-back rooms with wood furnishings feature free Wi-Fi, satellite TV and work desks, along with en suite bathrooms. It is a bit of walk from the Wien Hbf (20 minutes), or around 5 minute walk from Keplerplatz U1. TV is very old and only BBC World News - no other English Channels. A short walk from the  u bahn and shops nearby. Had to catch an early flight so easy to and from the station with luggage The hotel is very new, rooms are very clean and spacious, the room design is very modern. Caroline in Wien, Austria is four kilometres from Haus der Musik interactive museum and six kilometres from University of Vienna. Nicely located just outside of the centre but Metro station very close to the hotel and just 4 stops (a few minutes) to the heart of the city. A complimentary Viennesse breakfast buffet is served in the bright dining area. Enjoyed a few days in a quiet and clean room. Nice shops near by, quite away from tourist area, but there is a Metro just by the Hotel. But what was really amazing was how quiet the hotel was! Not only this is ridiculous, but the whole idea of a business hotel doing Internet filtering - which can't be turned off - is very questionable. I needed a little additional help like an iron and ironing board, since I was launching for a wedding,  The room was clean. The hotel offers guests in-room mini fridges and parking for a charge. Caroline is one kilometre from Vienna Central Station, two kilometres from Museum of Military History and three kilometres from Belvedere Palace. Children under two years old can stay free of charge.
He informed the front desk that he would be paying cash. If you are looking for value for money and not the Ritz Carlton then this is a good fit. Days inn is a nice hotel close to base with an outdoor pool. Had to wear shoes in the room or the carpet turned your feet black, had to shower in the dark with phone flashlight after clerk was notified is was broke, mold all over bathroom, when you walk in the smell of mildew is overwhelming! The shower wouldn't drain, the TV barely worked, and the faucets were so loose they were hard to use. It was in minutes of Air Force base, but the carpet was nasty in the tub was unclean. It was bearable for one night but as my title says, I will not stay there again. I hope they get on their cleaning and maintenance game Inspected 2rooms b4 settling on the one we stayed in. 2) Room was not cleaned the last 3 days we were there. The gentleman who checked us in / out was kind, but the room was not very pleasant. If that's not enough for you, what I'm unable to photograph is the smell of the room, the sound of the sticky floors, or the feeling of needing a shower to cleanse myself after being in their nasty shower. We had to wear our shoes at all times and even in the shower because it was also filthy! Asked for missing tv remote, was told it would take 2 hrs. There was mildew all over the shower,  The paint was peeling and different colors in the bathroom. She was a pleasure to see each morning and she was the only one to tell us what was going on in the San Antonio area. 3) I used my credit card for a friend to put a deposit on his room. The lady who put the breakfast together in the morning was the ONLY person who was friendly and helpful. Staff stated that there was nothing they could do to change their mistake. A room would typically cost $59 but jumps to $129 during weekends with a graduation ceremony. The location of our room was upstairs in the front, which is right next to the interstate, so we heard traffic all night long. Stains on the chair and ottoman and stains all over the carpet. I don't think the shower/tub had been properly cleaned for a good while if ever! Just a lil outdated but other than that it was fine I am aware there are much worse places; however, I would not stay here again. we got fed up with the condition we were sleeping in so we went down to tell the staff and they gave us a new room. I was locked in at $201.94 and ended up $303.52! The first night the heater in our room was not working. Other facilities include business center, a 24-hour front desk and free newspaper. Please know that I provided both photos and videos to the 17 year old staff on duty. The chair at the desk, as my boyfriend said, looked like it was taken out of a dumpster. The room smelled horrible and I ask for two room change and all still smelled. I will never stay here again & I would highly recommend to everyone to stay elsewhere! All rooms have en-suite bathrooms and offer facilities like cable TV, microwave, minifridge, tea/coffee maker and iron board. Sketchy area,  looked unsafe, room walls had chipped paint, moldy walls in bathroom, bad shower head with no water pressure, air conditioner smelled moldy,  room felt damp, everything was very uncomfortable. They took out the dirty towels but never replaced them, and we had to request towels every night, which they had the security guard bring. My sisters bed had bed bugs and the manager didn't seem to care too much. If you are going to Air Force BMT Graduation on a budget and want to be close to the base this motel will due. The room smelled bad, we had to plug in the lights upon checking in at night. Most of the front desk staff were not helpful    The breakfast was ok. The worker on duty when we arrived was very helpful on the other hand. Here is what I walked into in my room: 1) Ripped up upholstery on chair 2) Ripped lamp shade 3) Ripped curtains 4) A supposedly non-smoking room that smelled very smokey 5) A bandaid stuck to sheets 6) cigarette hole burns in sheets 7) room was not cleaned every day I was there, bed left unmade 8) prior occupant's depressant medication left on a table top  Maybe other rooms where far better cared for than mine. We packed anything of value in the car and took it with us every day. That is not enough of a reason to endure the conditions and stay here. The staff were friendly but that's all I have to say that's positive. This was spring break week and 85% of San Antonio was booked. When he went to check out he was informed his room was charged to my credit card. They didn't help me adjust the price nor tell me that my reservation had gotten messed up. Had I brought a black light I probably would've thrown up. It was very close to Airport base, a bed to sleep in but not clean at all. This place is pet friendly but my dog is so much cleaner and was dirty just from walking on the floors. I refused...the sink now wasn't draining and began leaking on the floor over night. Also, the prices fluctuate depending on what is happening in town. The rooms have their own air conditioners and spacious showers. Shower didn’t work, bathtub wouldn’t hold water to take a bath. There was an issue with the key to the room. People did check into and stayed in those rooms the next day. Great proximity to Lackland, OK if you’re not too picky. Guests may savor complimentary continental breakfast at the hotel and may also visit various fast food joints and restaurants located nearby. Low and behold that room had roaches running around the dresser and TV. He gave me good advice about our activities without me needing to ask. Mold on shower Smelly room Dirty base boards and edges of carpet Disgusting toilet- inside and out Thin rough towels  Not nice sheets Shall I go on? Dirty and mold all over the bathroom, reported to front desk they didn't seem to care. If my wife and kids were with me I would have left and stayed somewhere else. After that a night staff came on duty and he had security take me around to find a room that appeared to be decent. You will sleep better & your feet will be cleaner! He spilled a little water from his bowl & when I dried it with a towel the towel turned black! This is a hotel that is close to the base and knows the guest have to be there early to see their Airman. Stayed here because our son was graduating from Air Force Basic Training, so chose this hotel for its proximity to the base. Then I woke up to get to the AFB, no breakfast was ready, they had just started the oatmeal soup. Mildew was covered with paint, the iron didn't work, and some of the lights didn't work. SeaWorld San Antonio is 8.2 miles and Wolff Municipal Stadium and Joint Base San Antonio are within a 30-minute walk from the hotel. Some to know English, too much in a rush to even listen to you and your concerns. They gave him an 800 number to call but informed him that no one would be available until Monday. The room was not clean and the toilet was not working The hotel features an outdoor pool and offers free Wi-Fi access in public areas. Carpet dirty and peeling, office chair looks like it came out of a dumpster. I am also aware that you get what you pay for and as this motel was marked down from $90 to $39 for the night, I knew not to expect anything outstanding but this was disappointing. Want to charge you $35 search for a one hour late check-out. The best food they had was Raison Bread & the coffee. Upon arrival I received my first of  FIVE rooms which had mold all over the bathroom walls, second room had mold and electricity problems, third room upon turning on the lights in the bathroom there are roaches both big and small running rampant, fourth room upon entering I noticed that the window was open and the room had an order which was from a leaking pipe under the sink that had the carpet wet all the way into the bedroom area. They didn’t want to refund us and only gave us 10.00 discount and charged us a higher fee for the second night. We checked in after 10 pm and the man at the desk was rather rude. The carpet had giant tears in it, and they clearly haven't been cleaned/changed since the 90's. Toilet leaked at the foor in one, moldy tub in the other. We were a bit disappointed but they did offer to give us a different room. I couldn't bring myself to take pics of the gross stains on the walls, shower, and carpet -- it was best I kept the lights dim so I could pretend it wasn't that bad. I think I end up paying something in the high 70's per night. Ok for price paid this hotel is showing it's age. Sink would not drain and staff left it full of dirty water all day, had to fix drain plug myself. The bath / shower did not look very clean; my boyfriend used it but I did not. Since its was just me in town for a competition, I really did not mind the mold in the shower, the hard squeaky bed, or the base board coming off the wall in multiple spots. There was even mold in the lid of the ice bucket. I was last in San Antonio in 1998 and it's still looks pretty much the same. Noise from the highway, but that would almost be acceptable if the room was clean. The staff was nice and helpful, but building is dilapidated and in desperate need of either major remodeling or demolishing. I don't understand why they charge a pet fee when your pet leaves dirtier than when they arrived & it's not possible for a pet to do any damage to the carpet or room smell! When we checked into the room it had a musty smell. I didn't know that area at all and was looking in a particular price range. Broken hair dryer was fixed after second day, burn on carpet,  but great breakfast daily I was expecting the worse...prepared with bug spray and Clorox wipes. We had other family staying at another hotel for $6 more a night and it was nice , so we went over there to get into their hot tub and pool. I went to the office to report the problem and I was told she would get the list fixed while we were gone, When we return exhausted it was not done. The refrigerator was filthy on the outside (but did appear clean on the inside). I recently stayed for a trip,  was not impressed with the room. Hotel staff was quick to help out and fix it. This place is very close to Lackland AFB & that is the only positive thing to say. I am jut writing an honest review of the room I had. The pic I've included of the disintegrating chair should give you a good idea of the state of this place. The lady in the front was real nice or pleasant. The carpets are very dirty and will leave your feet black if you walk around in your room. Plus those living there on their weekly rate plan and the neighborhood were questionable. Days Inn San Antonio Near Lackland features a relaxing heated pool with a grilling area and offers free parking facility to cars and large vehicles. Even after telling them about all of these issues, they did nothing to make it right! Please do not stay here unless you have no other choice. The shower bar was broken and the curtain was sliding inward...water was flying out on the floor. When we got to our room we saw cockroaches on the walls, stains on the lampshades, curtains and floors.. the blankets smelled so bad we had to go buy our own. When I hopped into the shower the black mold was all over it. We were disappointed in the breakfast served: Allot of Oatmeal, Egg/cheese, 1 of 2 days stay they had waffles, no meats at all on both days. the whole hotel room in general smelled so horribly disgusting we had to buy a candle and air freshener. ...the only major complaint was the rug was filthy....needs total update but for the price....well worth it!! it didn’t smell as bad but we still weren’t comfortable and later saw cockroaches again. The room was good ,but the bathroom was kinda dirty (ie walls were dusty the tub n shower were dirty)  We stayed 4 days and the 3rd morning we woke up to roaches crawling out of the clock. The room had numerous stains on the carpet and walls. Stay closer to San Antonio and drive a short while to the base. The toilet kept backing up and overflowed the last night there,  The TV in the room did not work the first 2 nights and wasn't fixed until the 3rd day,  The carpet the room was nasty, The clothes hanger came out of the wall with nothing on it. Days Inn San Antonio Near Lackland is a budget hotel located along Highway 90 and within a 15-minute walk from Lackland Air Force Base and Wilford Hall Medical Center. But I would much rather have been further away to have a nicer/decent hotel. I provided the morning manager with all the videos and photos and he refunded the cost.
So we had to take a tram and as a result were late for a business dinner! Big rooms, good breakfast, helpful staff.Interesting layout being on the 7th and 8th floor. The 4-star H+ Hotel Leipzig, opened in September 2010, is on the 7th and 8th floor of the Gutenberg Gallery; as well as the central yet quiet location you have an impressive view over Leipzig’s skyline. We asked a taxi service from the reception and were given 5 minutes waiting time. We went out and there was no taxi for 25 minutes. The receptionist told us that she is not allowed to use other taxi companies!!! Then we went up to the reception and suggested to change the taxi company as that approach is not serious. Thanks to its central location, the H+ Hotel Leipzig is ideal for business travellers as well as for tourists. Breakfast buffet is good with lots of cold meats, fruit, vegetables and bread as well as hot food, cereals and yoghurts etc. So to Ramada is more important to please their business partners instead of pleasing their customers! This centrally located hotel is very clean, modern and quiet. Ideal, near city centre, good all round hotel, strangely only on 7th & 8th floor of pictured building Notwithstanding the sheer unprofessional and unreliable attitude of their taxi partner! Good wifi, fantastic breakfast  Out of town, not many restaurants around and they don't have one other than for breakfast The hotel has 121 comfortable bedrooms and 350 underground parking spaces with direct access to the hotel.
The hotel is across from a mall, which was convenient for shopping and quick meals. Steps from the Messe and minutes from the Main Tower, the Citadines City Centre Frankfurt offers stylish serviced apartments with private parking. A fitness centre and a business corner are available on site. I arrived very early in the morning and was allowed to check in immediately. The washer and dryer within the bathroom was much appreciated as we’d been traveling for more than a week. I didn't notice that they've cleaned the room while I was there,or changed the towels, but I'm all for being environmentally friendly, so I actually prefer that. It's an apartment hotel so you won't get your towels changed or the room cleaned everyday unless you pay extra but so what? In the first 2 nites the receptionist let us stay but after returning from munich late at nite they force us to take another room. The room was absolutely superb, spacious,beautifully furbished with everything you can ask for, though the bookfair pricing was a fairly high. I didn't have much time to spend in the room anyway, but that could have been fairly problematic, if someone goes there for business and can't access the internet. The WIFI was not working for the whole length of my stay, apparently due to a server error that affected the whole chain in Europe. I was attending the Frankfurt Book Fair and stayed in Citadines for 3 nights. It's easy to hit your head in the cupboards handle over the sink. Very comfortable and a reasonable rate for a 2 day business trip in Frankfurt. A fresh breakfast buffet is served daily, and guests can also enjoy their morning coffee out on the terrace. There’s a complimentary coffee machine in the lobby, which makes various drinks including cafe au lait. The popular Der Fette Bulle restaurant is ten minutes away by car. Great location ..shopping centre opposite..walk to main train station for long journey or walk to underground for local trips.Room was small but functional good for short stays I did around 10 minutes local city call and they charged more than 70 Euro, I was very upset in all hotels around the world, local calls are free and even if this is their policy they should write it in the phone directory at the room. Probably the biggest thing for me was the room was quiet - no hum from either the fridge or the Aircon. Room size is very comfortable with nice view full kitchen. Guests can choose between studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments, each featuring a flat screen satellite television, free Wi-Fi, and a kitchenette with a refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave. Donnas very luxurious   Bonus having the Skyline shopping Plaza over the road   Facilities were great at the hotel/apartment   Close walking distance from main station The Kleinmarkthalle, Frankfurter Romer, and Cathedral of St. Bartholomew are easily accessible via S-Bahn. Immediately opposite the Skyline Plaza shopping Centre which is open late. We stayed in a one bedroom unit and were pleased with the comfort and space for our family of four. Only a 2 min walk to the Hall 3 entrance to Messefrankfurt where the airport bus (Euro7.50, 20 mins journey) arrives and departs. When I asked for towels they brought them at the front desk and handle them to me in front of customers and asked me to take them to my room,,,, REALLY? I tried to reason with them since we are going to check out early in the morning at 5 Am please let us just stay in 1 room but they will not tolerate anything. Citadines City Centre Frankfurt welcomes travellers with a 24-hour front desk. First time I hear cleaning service is once a week, RIDICULOUS , they should write this information when they do the ad on Expedia. We stayed there for 4 nites in A 1 bedroom apartment. Nice and comfy room but expensive for the services provided. Very good location, clean, friendly staff and early check in. The Staedel Museum is a 30-minute walk or 10-minute drive. Bed was comfortable and therefore a good nights sleep 5 mins walking (cut through the shopping centre) to the messe. The construction sound is very disturbing and it is far from the public transportation. One bedroom rooms are spacious with well equipped kitchen and en suite laundry machines. The hotel is right across a big mall with many restaurants and shops.
They had no roll aways although I requested in advance so my oldest slept on the floor. I’ve stayed at hundreds of hotels and have never experienced anything like this. When we broke a bottle of red wine (a gift we had purchased), they cleaned it up entirely and very very nice about it. We were very pleased with this reasonably price hotel so close to the Atlanta Airport. IT WAS A NICE ROOM BUT IT COULD OF HAD BETTER SERVICE. Thin walls meant that we could hear the next room's tv at night while trying to sleep. For a pet friendly hotel, this was a very nice one....except there really is not a clean place for my pet to relieved himself. Housekeeping found boxes and tape so we could fly (We had driven from south Florida). Accessible rooms are available as are upgrade rooms adding a microwave and mini-fridge. The only complaint was the wifi signal in our room was very poor. The sink is outside of the bathroom so it will disturb everyone else if someone gets up earlier and gets ready. At this point I had to get a 3rd room assigned. What hotel doesn’t offer to bring a glass of water to its guest? The only thing we missed was USB ports in the room. Very personable and welcoming staff, even at 3am in the morning! I forgot to ask about international and they failed to tell me they did not shuttle to the international airport. I only stayed one night but the all of the staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed here because we were fraveling with a pet, and La Quinta doesn't charge an extra pet fee. I decided Atlanta was the destination and while this trip is pretty expensive, the quality of this trip was amazing. I went across the street to have dinner and upon returning found out that they had done the same thing with my room except the new people that were given the key to my room took my stuff out and left it at the front desk. nice ，cⅠean，Like room Decor。Good place for one day stay close airport。 It was slippery and I had to place a towel in the shower to offer more safety because there was absolutely nothing to hold on to. The breakfast was delicious and I like that it was served early enough that I could eat before leaving. We had a 11 hour layover and selected La Quinta in to stay in over night. Great breakfast, very clean, the next time  i return, i'll be there We were very pleased with this well designed, clean, friendly hotel. Motel 6 Atlanta – Airport North offers simple budget accommodation next door to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. we left our car in La Quinta's really nice long term parking  area as we flew off to Jamica. Be aware that breakfast starts at 7 am which seems odd since most of the people staying there were catching morning flights and missed breakfast. Check in was long and room keys did not work when we got finally got to the room. Not too happy about that for the price we paid!! Take a sound machine to drown out the planes taking off. I stayed one night before a flight with my wife and 3 kids ages 5, 10, and 13. Very convenient to the airport and had a great place to eat within walking distance. The breakfast was fine if you just want cereal/yogurt/muffins but if you're looking for a good cooked breakfast, we wouldn't recommend this hotel. Our room's door had to be forced to close all the way - and then wouldn't lock! Very nice hotel, clean and quiet with easy and fast access to Atlanta airport. Hotel staff and security staff were very friendly and professional and always available for any questions or needs. There's really nothing else needs to be said, it was excellent deal and stay. They then lost my paperwork and I waited another 20 mins to get the key to my 3rd and final room. Unfussy air-conditioned rooms all include an en suite bathroom, desk, cable TV and free local calls. The rooms were clean but there was a rust stain on the bathroom wall beneath the handrail in the tub. First time to drive to Atlanta and stay at this location. So I wanted to go somewhere that not only involved somewhere I've been before, but somewhere that was affordable for someone like me working 2 jobs with tons of bills. Also, the cleaning crew were doing a great job with making sure the carpet in the hallways were clean and smell fresh. It was close to the airport and there were several restaurants within walking distance. The welcome approach is encouraging.I felt relaxed .The staff were humble,They answer me promptly .The records were checked and booking confirmed..I got to my room ,seeing the enticing  environment made me to sleep off immediately. We were able to park our car at the hotel for 5 dollars per day and take a shuttle right to our terminal at the airport. Shuttle to airport was great too (but you need more visible signs on the bus which was a little hard to spot) The hotel is nice and 10 minutes from the airport. Shuttle pick up from the airport  is at Zone 2...15 and 45 after the hour. Very nice staff and close to airport Very accommodating to my early check in need The hotel stay was so much better than I expected it to be. When my 98 yr old aunt fell out of bed, the staff came and helped me lift her back into bed. Several restaurants you can walk to and plenty of parking. We have stayed at several of the lower cost hotels around ATL over the years and find this property to be the best in cleanliness, room size, over all condition, parking, and access to the airport. The staff was very professional, the room was clean, spacious & comfortable. My stay at your hotel was very pleasant, and the staff were very accommodating. I hated the fact that when I called the hotel lobby and requested for a glass of water, I was told by the front desk attendant that this hotel does not do that. My daughter was here for the weekend to visit a college. I was first given a key for a room that was occupied with another guest, it was very disturbing walking in on another individual. The pool is closed seasonally until May (we were there for spring break and the kids were hoping to swim). They offer long term parking for $5 a day and have a shuttle every half hour to the airport starting at 4:30am. my husband had an international flight and when I asked if there was a shuttle to the airport they said yes. I had planned to use the park and ride option, but realized when I arrived that the shuttle only goes to the domestic terminal. There also are several restaurants in walking distance and gas stations close for refueling the rental car. A very modern decor so we figured they would have them. Non-smoking Motel 6 Atlanta – Airport North is just off highway I-85 and within ten miles of downtown Atlanta, where visitors can sample southern cuisine plus a wide choice of shopping and entertainment options. Facilities include an outdoor swimming pool, elevators, 24-hour reception with vending machines, business center and a launderette. I really enjoyed my stay, the breakfast was better than I thought it would be. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly, the beds are very comfortable, great breakfast. When they were taking off going West, you could hear them. We paid $10 per day to leave our car there and took the shuttle to the airport. Make your own mini waffles was a hit with the kids. Guests can enjoy free on-site parking, free Wi-Fi and a free shuttle bus to make the two-mile journey to the airport. The free breakfast was delicious and the room was very comfortable. My only issue was that it said room for 5 but that wasn't true. The room was okay and the location was convenient for the airport but we were not impressed with anything. That next morning the breakfast team were very helpful and delightful to talk to. This was a perfect hotel for an overnight stay en route to another destination. The shower was even made of glass and great and super-fast check in experience. They let us have a late check out, so we could go directly to our flight and not have to still around in the airport. We had a sound machine so were able to sleep with no problem. The only thing we didn't like was the air freshener smells which were very strong in the lobby and the room. The hotel maintenance crew repaired most of the problems that were present in the room except the dresser draws kept sticking and I had to set on the bed to close the draws with my foot. Maintenance had to be called multiple times to fix it. The service was excellent especially the front desk , they were very courteous and attentive, love it The hotel was perfect for what we needed-a one night stay waiting for an early morning flight. Then we decided to stay again when we flew back into Atlanta before driving home the next morning. And, this extra service was all during a time that the hotel was completely filled with stressed out folks evacuating in advance of Hurricane Irma.
Happy overall but room on fifth floor had a constant low level exterior noise which for some could be annoying. This is my second, and last, stay here as both times I was put in a room I specifically requested not to be put in. We stayed for 3 nights to celebrate my wife’s birthday. We had easy access to the Bart station to watch the Warriors, could walk to the SFMOMA and to the Embarcadero, and used Uber to get everywhere else. However there were protesters outside that started in at about 7:30 and would not stop, extremely loud. Fisherman’s Wharf is three kilometres away, with the Golden Gate Bridge reachable in a 20-minute drive. nice view, clean rooms, excellent customer service, huge tv, best beds ever.. I had to have service come up and show me, which they did with great courtesy. I did not like the fact that hotel does not have parking. Each has its own sitting area, many with city or bay views. A lovely hotel experience in the middle of the Financial District very close to Market, North Beach, and the Embarcadero. In addition, there wasn’t a microwave or coffee maker in our room. Fantastic hotel in a great location close to lots of great activities. Hotel staff was really dishonest when they found out it. High quality hotel with a high price but worth it. They allowed a very early check-in as they had availability. There is also a 24-hour front desk and an on-site fitness centre. I guess its my fault for unlading the for myself. This Meridien hotel is very good -- a great location for walking to many of San Francisco's sites such as the Ferry Building, North Beach, and Chinatown. There were no explanations of how the lights in my room worked, or how the phone functioned. We especially loved hearing French spoken by many in the hotel (Air France has a contract for their airline staff to stay at the hotel). I was upset that this hotel charges for WiFi when I paid $300 a night. The accommodation is a ten-minute walk of Chinatown, the Embarcadero, and the Ferry Building. The hotel was nice, but there was a labor dispute going on and protesters were constantly using blow horns to wake everyone up in the mornings so I wish I would have stayed somewhere else because I could not sleep or concentrate for work with all the noise going on. We're given free upgrade of room which made our Christmas break really awesome!!! This was our second stay here and is now one of our favorite places to stay. People have even have party in the room in midnight. It is within walking distance to the Ferry Building and the Exploratorium and about a mile and a half from Pier 39. The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. I do think the $10 delivery charge on the room service bill, plus included gratuity seems a bit high but maybe that is standard in San Fran. The room was spacious and we had a view of the Bay Bridge. I’ve always stay at high end hotels for sometimes less expensive then this one and it wasn’t accommodating. The on-site Park Grill serves breakfast and lunch in elegant surroundings, with stunning city views. On checking in they put us on a low floor next to the ice machine despite my request for a high floor away from the ice machine. Attractive hotel, nice staff, delivered whatever I needed (coffee pot). The 360 en-suite bedrooms and suites are decorated in warm colours and feature granite bathrooms. The staff were all great and the room was huge and clean! In the heart of San Francisco’s financial district, Le Meridien San Francisco offers contemporary accommodation and state-of-the-art facilities for hosting conferences and events. During the week, lots of morning coffee options but not so on the weekend. Radios and flat-screen televisions are supplied, with pay-per-view channels, safes, and wired and wireless Internet connections all available for a supplement. This hotel was perfect, clean, well appointed and a good value. Location in Financial District bit far from main shops andattractions, but great for waterfront. Wish it was closer to union square but overall I loved everything about this place I would totally stay there again next time! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel to those looking for a quiet area to stay yet close enough to local bars/lounges and great restaurants. The last night I was staying in the hotel a union protest broke out around 7:30am. staff of hotel provide disappointing service, especially their staff of restaurant. Room description says refrigerator, but it is stocked with minibar stuff so can't put your own wine in it. We had a overnight stay here after a long day of travelling. Room service was efficient and the food was very good. A bit spendy but hey, I'm from the Midwest so San Francisco is sticker shock to me on just about every level, Still all in all a great place Also to charge $62.00 a night for Vallet parking when your already staying there is ridiculous. This was my first time staying at Le Meridien, I enjoyed my experience! Very nice hotel centrally located in Financial District near Ferry Building. Nice stay in the Luxury Queen Suite 22nd floor--great view of the Bay Bridge to Coit Tower. Hotel staff at check in very accomodating allowing for a couple of hour extension for a late check out following day. Very large window with lots of natural light in the room. No apology from check-in counter for the lack of assistance from the $70 per night valet...but did receive a little attitude from the desk person when we had to dig through the luggage cart to find our credit cards. Nice location in the financial district within walking distance of some of SF's great neighborhoods and easy access to mass transportation. The room was more spacious than most other hotel rooms in the city and we had a wonderful view of the Bay Bridge from the 18th floor. Great all around from check in till the point when we left we will so serene and relaxing definitely will be back It was a pleasure trip & we enjoyed it tremendously. Felt the hotel was skimpy with towels- only one set per person. Good location, staff can be improved...better trained and more professional The suites are amazing, the entire staff from day 1 to day 3 were all so nice and happy. We staycationed in SF and this was the perfect location to enjoy downtown and the Ferry Building restaurants. Fortunately, we got to the hotel early and instead of getting a room on the 20th floor that would have been a normal size room, we got a suite with balcony on the 8th floor (corner unit) with amazing views of the bay bridge and Oakland hills. Although I made a reservation for two people, but my room is for one. Hotel is average for the price point but the staff are very friendly and accommodating. No coffee making provisions in room with a card for one complementary  coffee provided at check in and note to say coffee maker can be provided on request. Not a bad location for tourists--Chinatown, Embarcadero, Union Square, BART/Muni within walking distance. So needless to say I was not happy about that. FYI it is near an SF fire department station soooo it can be noisy at times. We got a great rate on Expedia and were extremely pleased with our stay. The 2nd night I upgrade the suite to the NEW YORK Suite. Beautiful, modern hotel in the heart of the financial district. A little loud at nigh, but that is the city. After calling the front desk we were moved to a higher floor away from the noisy ice machine. Although minor, in my view, cofffee making in room should be standard in a 4 star hotel. also because of the location, it can be noisy at night. I flew up to San Fran to see my girl friend for 3 days and booked this hotel. The hotel is situated close to Union Square and SFMOMA and Chinatown. Felt rumbling when in bed- vibrations coming from somewhere in hotel- machinery? The water barely drips out of the sink, but the shower was ok. Our room was never vacuumed during our stay, and when I noticed some debris under the coffee table I picked it up and cut my finger on a piece of glass! Le Meridien San Francisco hosts no fewer than 15 function and meeting rooms with a maximum capacity of 225. After five more minutes we grabbed a luggage cart and unloaded our luggage our selves. Guests can also savour Mediterranean flavours in the flamboyant Bar 333. My boyfriend and I were spending the weekend in SF and so happy that we chose this hotel. We checked in very late at night of one night after a long flight.
We decided to try the in house restaurant, BIG mistake, VERY over priced, service sucked  if you were not wearing a suit or similar attire, forget service. I know that surrounding hotels have bigger suites for a cheaper price. Had to make call to Hotels.com to get it corrected The staff was not friendly.Terrible smell in the hallways. Other hotels have it ready as soon as you get there even if their check in is at a later time. Upon arriving, we were given a disgusting pack n' play crib for our child....however this was corrected before the second night. It was cold in Houston that day dropping to 30. Not the greatest, but pretty solid hotel for the cost. The Hilton Houston North is located in the Greenspoint Business district and is a short 25 minute commute to Houston’s central business district. The tub did not drain well, so when you shower, you are standing in water. I do not stand the best option considering that it is a Hilton This hotel as with all hotels need to be clear about if they need additional funds or deposit from you and what that amount would be... so people are prepared.. the person in front of me was having issues with this even though they prepaid there room The room was great, the price was fair, and the location suited our needs. Only thing I would say is a downer is the check in. Walls between our room and the adjoining room were pretty thin. I waited to check out, was not even acknowledged as one girl talked on the phone and another was checking in a guest (at 6:00 a.m.). Walking distance to the mall and movie theater for a little distraction. The suite we had on the 15th floor was much more than we expected for the rate we got. Parking is free and business travelers have unlimited access to the business centre. We turned on the heat like anyone would had done and waited. Called for the airport shuttle and had to wait 20 minutes (shuttle driver was a nice guy). I'm pretty sure it was the security guard making his rounds but it woke me up every 20 minutes all night long. One major flaw - you have pay for the internet (ok, i get that) but the internet service, even after paid for is terrible and the Hilton knows it. the hotel is not bad but the bathrooms are old they should be renovated. I did not have any issues while staying in the Hotel which is something that I value. The door was opened and let slam shut all night long. Had two special requests and both were taken care of quickly. I would Choose not to drop off my wife at the entrance because if the thugs hanging out at the entrance i will not be back is in a very bad part of Town. Staff were great and a nice lobby organized for work which my group of 4 used consistently when we were not with clients. I will be staying here for the Houston open next year as well! We were told there would be a complimentary breakfast on the 16th floor and there was none. The Hilton Houston North offers a complimentary shuttle service to George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) which is a short 8 miles from the hotel. Shuttle runs to each terminal every 30 mins, no need to schedule. Our room was not cleaned the second day we were there, due to the staff attempting to clean at 6pm, while we were gwttunf ready for a wedding, but overall we had a good experience. I also was not allowed to use the internet, normally free as a Gold member, but was told I had to pay for internet use because I booked through a third party. There was blood on the bathroom floor during our initial night, and the toilet had not been cleaned on our last night. Modern rooms feature access to Wi-Fi, work desk, air-conditioning and Hilton Serenity Bed collection. Bottom line - DO NOT book a Hilton stay through Travelocity, better yet avoid Hilton altogether! I found the rooms small (and I booked a suite). I was given a terrible room at the end of the hall next to the stairwell door. The bathroom had drainage problems, the fixtures were rusted, the heat in our room barely put out heat. As a Hilton Honors member, these conditions were not a good reflection of the Hilton brand. They say they are working on it, but if the internet is mission critical to your stay in Houston, bring a hot spot or choose another hotel until they can guarantee you that it is fixed. Also, ran a metal shaving that was stuck in the carpet into my foot. No jetted tub rooms as described and paid extra for on Hotels.com... and every other major 3rd party booking site. If all you want is a room to sleep, this may be ok. Was satisfied then and am pleased with my stay this time. Will book here again the next time I'm in town. Our room was very nice, we arrived on our way to Galveston for a cruise. The heating systems in rooms are old and don't all work. So front desk downgraded us to a single room after verifying the heat was working and we moved over at 11:30pm. I asked for a Gold level room but was told I could not have one because I booked through a third party. They didn’t bother calling back the first 2 times I needed anything in room so I don’t expect it now. Great location, and includes free shuttle service to and from IAH airport. Its hard to believe rooms are not available till after 3pm and not a minute sooner. You feel like you could be mugged at any second. In the evening enjoy a drink at the Vino wine bar before sampling its dinner menu. I asked for a better room the next night and was given another room on a different floor yet again next to the stairwell door. Engineer was called up to fix but he could not fix the suite nor the bedroom. The music was so loud in the lobby that I stood outside to wait for the shuttle back to the airport. Engineer said it was broke and that all the systems in this hotel are old and need replacing. There was a black mold stench on the 6th floor ice machine area which was overpowering. I only stayed in the hotel for 1 night, but it was a gorgeous hotel that was only about 10-15 min away from the airport. Ate at restaurant, and while a little pricey, food was excellent! Beautiful hotel, the best in the North Houston area that I have seen. Even though they clearly have given that info out to all the booking websites. Unless they Bother to call me back and make it right I can only say don’t stay here if you expect any customer service. Trying to get work done, online was virtually impossible because of the poor wifi signal. The on-site Starbucks will kick start the day with any favorite coffee and breakfast, lunch and dinner is served in the Cafe restaurant. I like rock music but this was over the top for for 6:00 a.m. On the inside this hotel is fairly nice clean and good size rooms. By the way, they no longer recognize Hilton Honors status if you book on Travelocity or other sites that give you a better rate than Hilton's website. The room was ok but certainly not what you expect from a Hilton. You'll be rolling the dice on a room that works. The room did not feel very clean and there were stains on the carpet. Managers at Hilton didn’t care and said it wasn’t there problem. The employees did not make us feel welcomed, otherwise the stay and transportation was good. We awaken pretty late at night by the guests in the adjoining room the first evening we were there but they checked out the next morning so the rest of our stay was perfect. The outdoor pool was inviting except i did not have the time. First, if you are a Hilton rewards member DO NOT book through Travelocity as they will not give you the benefits or credit due to booking through a third party. people are nice there for  business projects ,in my experiences ,trust place will recommended The food at the lobby restaurant was so-so but decently priced (by hotel-restaurant standards, anyway); the service at said restaurant a bit below so-so. Once we arrived to the room we noticed that it was very cold. Got to the front desk and was treated more as an inconvenience than a guest. That I was the 30th call with 9 more after me. Clean room and common areas, very nice staff and hotel was located quite close to the highway, food and stores. I was the 4th customer being moved to a new room. Maintain any fitness regime in the on-site gym or swim a few laps in the pool to maintain fitness. We stayed here the night before boarding a cruise ship from Galveston. Our initial check was expeditious and the staff was very friendly. Houston's famed local attractions such and the Museum of Natural Sciences, NASA Space Centre and the Houston Zoo are also only a short distance away. There was extra fees and no comforter on the bed and small pillows. The room they gave us smelled like urine...my guess is because they allow pets and there is carpet in the rooms which need to be cleaned or possible update their carpet.
Whatever you many not love about the hotel which could be décor or location or whatever it is completely made up by such unforgettable service. When we arrived they knew who we were, upgraded us to the top room with amazing views of Paris and to top it off there was a plate of macarons and a lovely note. Service was top notch as the hotel staff made my daughter feel special with nice gifts in room. You can spend half the price at other hotels, even on the same block and have the exact same experience. said  we can not, only 1 blanket per room  I am not writing this because I am disgruntled or something really bad happened, it is just not worth half of what they charge a night, do your self a favor and book somewhere else. So for $300.00 a night USD in Paris there is not hotel better. Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel is situated very close to Ternes Metro Station, which gives easy access to Montmartre. The hotel has its own business centre and meeting rooms, while guests can also workout in the fitness centre. We stayed in Paris for 5 days at the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe Hotel. A very close walk to the Champs and Arc de Triomphe. Only minus point was that there was no bathtub- bathtub should be furnished in the better room. Not sure if that de-priorutised us, but our room was hardly cleaned and none of the used glasses etc were changed during our stay. The staff in the hotel as well as the restuarant went out of their way to make our stay perfect for us. However, each of the nights I found the room was missing something which bothered me a somewhat, ie a floor towel on the first night, bottles of water on the second, and paper to write down notes on the third. Our room was spacious and comfortable and included a very small balcony which is till better than no balcony at all. The Makassar restaurant offers French-Indonesian cuisine and a buffet breakfast is served every morning. The free breakfast was beautiful and done really well with many choices. To be fair, it seems that many if not most hotel rooms suffer from all or some of items 1), 2), 3). This is a low class hotel and should charge a budget rate, not a 5 star rate. But can easily imagine its so nice to sit in the terrace on the summer evening. Great place to stay - this hotel made our first Paris trip feel luxurious! The location is perfectly located next to Arc De Triumph, with plenty of restaurants and very close to Champs Elysees. The location is very convenient, the hotel serves a big breakfast, the staff is willing to help. Staff lovely friendly helpful and accommodating  Hotel well located to subway and easy access to sightseeing and shopping I search for the hotel with good reviews when I decided to get a package deal to see Paris ( my second time and my daughter's first). From the moment we arrived, the staff demonstrated a level of professionalism and courtesy one would expect from such a prestigious name as Renaissance. We finished a two week European vacation with five nights here. Upon check out we simply mentioned it and they removed $75.00 from our bill. We booked a suite which was advertised as accomodating 3 adults. The room was tiny and the option for the third adult was a rollout at the foot of the main bed - which would allow hardly any space for 3 sets of luggage let alone space for us all to move. Location is excellent close to the arc de triomphe and champs elyze. Cumbersome, could get burned and/or knock one of the appliances over. Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel is situated near to the Champs Elysées, with views of Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. I travel a lot for business and generally do not review hotels, but this one definitely stood out. I have stayed at the Ritz in Paris, Hotel Le Meurice in Paris, these are thousand dollar a night rooms. We all wanted to watch a movie and management sent up blankets and pillows so we could all be comfortable. Received a nice surprise of desserts, wine and macrons for my wifes birthday! The location was near the Ternes and Charles de Gaulle Etoile metro stations and within walking distance of several great places to eat and drink. However, was just one fairly large room, not what I would call a suite. Close enough to major attractions yet not right in the middle of the crowds. It might have been because the hotel was pretty full those nights and the housekeepers were busy to get the rooms turnarounded quickly. The hotel staff is very friendly the rooms were nice and it is convenient as located very close to a metro (5 minute walk) and we used the metro all over Paris. I appreciate the little touches in the room - the bathroom decorations, the treats on top of the bed after the room was made, and the excellent service. Yes, I could have called to get those, but the fact that those were missing in the first place makes it a disappointment. Room was clean and adequate--although the descriptor Suite is a bit misleading (Junior Suite). Oh, and the mini garden terrace looks very bright although I couldn't go outside due to the cold air unfortunately. I am going to tell it to you directly as it is. Also, a few annoying inconveniences: 1) too few outlets, had to unplug lights to be able to charge our devices; 2) too few hooks/towel bars in the bathroom; 3) poor overall room lighting--especially in the center of the room; 4) location of the coffee maker and the hot plate (for hot water) were stuck in a very small cubicle with only one outlet, so had to reach in the back to switch. Soundproofed guestrooms feature an MP3 station, flat-screen TV, work desk, minibar, coffeemaker and premium cotton sheets. My cousin and I booked our entire Paris trip through Travelocity, and this hotel came highly recommended. The best part are friendly, profesional and English speaking staff. The heating system was very poor.The room didn’t have a heater The front desk staff and concierge are very helpful with planning an itinerary for your stay. The hotel staff were amazing, my flight was arriving in late so I emailed them to let them know, I also mentioned it was a surprise gift for my partner. Two dishes were not right but still really good an edible. Truly a great stay with excellent service from start to finish. If this hotel were in America it would be a 3 star $100 a night hotel. A bit pricey but it's worth it for comfort and location alone. They listened and communictaed with excellence and accommodated our needs as well. Meanwhile, the hotel is a 10-minute walk from the iconic Champs-Elysees, with its shops, cafes and cinemas. Room service had a slight hiccup because we complicated the order with so many meals and American requests. The facilities itself are in line of what you expect from a hotel of this standard. The Eiffel Tower and shopping at Galeries Lafayette are a ten-minute drive away. The reason for the trip was because we both love macarons and this was our first ever trip together. The hotel is conveniently located close to the Arc de Triomphe and Ave de Champs Élysées. Yes the food at one of the above referenced hotels may have been better but it would have also cost three times as much. We had our family meeting us in Paris so we had many people in the room at different times. They say room for 3, but each day there was only ever 2 towels to use! Great staff, great service, great location, great gym, great room quality, great restaurant! I give such thanks to the management for making our trip so special. The hotel is a nothing nice, or special at all. Wanted a centrally located hotel close to Metro and landmarks. Came here for our anniversary, it was great and the service was amazing. They are beautiful and very French but could not hold a candle to the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe for service and cleanliness. Despite the high cost, I would be inclined to return to this location in the future. Some have balconies or floor-to-ceiling windows and all offer Wi-Fi and complimentary daily newspapers. They couldn’t do enough for us, cabs, recommendations, and concern for our pleasant time in Paris The restaurant is garbage, the rooms did not get cleaned properly, They refused to bring us a 2nd blanket. Surprised my wife with trip to Paris for our 35th Wedding Anniversary. Every wish, every request was granted and we had a lot of them. The staff was so helpful and friendly when explaining the service included in my packege (she is Italian but speaks fluent English). Ms. Marie LeRoux specially was very instrumental in providing us with what we were looking for. The Arc is only about a block away, it’s central to shops, restaurants, and a farmer’s market, and the staff/concierge was on top of things.
It was one mile from the Alamadome where we were going for a venue. We played games in the living room part of the room with 6 people, plenty of seating! Expensive  $27/day parking,  better to park in structure across street if not using car $17/day but charges start again every time you enter. BREAKFAST ,YUMMY, GREAT STAFF, AND A GREAT DINNER.TOO STAFF AT THIS PLACE IS, AS NICE , AS WE HAVE BEEN(WE BEEN A FEW PLACES). Hotel is on the Riverwalk and close to places you would want to visit. Steps from the Alamo, the Homewood Suites by Hilton San Antonio Riverwalk Downtown offers modern, family friendly accommodations in a historic building overlooking the water. Guests enjoy a daily hot breakfast buffet on the house, as well as complimentary drinks and snacks at the evening social, held four nights a week. I also thought breakfast could've been better--the eggs were always too funny and the saisage didn't taste right. Definitely not what  i Spect ,  there is no choice on parking just by Valet parking xtra   $30 and no food service. But the front desk told us to come down and they would give us some. We enjoyed our stay very much and would choose the same hotel if we visit San Antonio again. Wife and I thought full beds were very uncomfortable, but other than that we really enjoyed the hotel. We stayed in 11 hotels and motels from March 8 to March 25. Breakfast buffet is nice, the same breakfast as at the Hampton Inns. The spacious one-bedroom and two-bedroom suites each feature complimentary Wi-Fi, a flat-screen cable television, and a full kitchen with a stovetop, refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave. He definitely  went  way  beyond  just  helping  and  I  will  always  (fondly)  remember  my  stay. Many popular restaurants, including Bella On the River and Biga On the Banks, are steps away. Liked the location as it was near the good part of the Riverwalk. Away from some of the overcrowded, busy areas, but easily within walking distance of all shopping and restaurants. Love this place because of the quiet location on the river. It is on the riverwalk on a quieter section (no restaurant or bar noise). Overall loved our stay and will go back next time in San Antonio. Some upgrades to a more modern look would be nice. Good place if you need to stay for a number of days. I know I should have paid for just a little nicer hotel and you could definitely feel and see the difference. Close to everything on the river walk no need to drive. Great location to river walk and not to far from convention center. They did have Texas shaped waffles that made up for it, though. It kept kicking me off and wouldn't work for the two days were were there. Our room was fabulous and the staff was very helpful. The Spanish Governor's Palace, Rivercenter Mall, El Mercado, and the famous Riverwalk are also within a comfortable stroll, while a short drive takes guests to SeaWorld, Six Flags Fiesta Texas, or the San Antonio Zoo. Great view of the River Walk from the lobby but not from our room - windows are not floor to ceiling in rooms. Unfortunately we missed the social evening events due to a weekend trip. Happy hour was fun with lots of beer, margaritas and snacks. But buffets were good and the senery from dinnery always pleasant. Thought the food and beverages in the mini-store were very reasonable. While Homewood suites is on the quieter end of the Riverwalk it is still very convenient to most major sites. We enjoyed the stay .. Hotel personnel was fabulous ! The room could use a little update but it was fine. Staff from housekeeping to front staff were great, they even scanned and emailed a document for me when I got into a bind. The outside of the hotel look really old and outdated but the inside is fairly big and nice. 2 or 3 blocks from the clubs and crowds, walkable if you choose to do that. The  stay  was  more  than  great  !! I  want  to  give  a  special  thanks  to  Todd  (manager)  for  helping me  retrieve  my  electronic  car  keys  and  forwarding  them  to  me  in  the  Bay  Area. The bathroom wasn’t all that clean - we found pubc hair that wasn’t ours in the shower! When we arrived, we had some trouble with the icemaker working. anyway great place super cool we will stay there again period, just, put some shade on the roof........ Great view of river walk & access to walking it & the city sites& restaurants. The hotel is next to so many restaurants and walking distance to the Alamo. Besides the issue with the wifi, we had a great stay. Checked in on friday around 6pm and we went to sleep aorund 10 so the next day we were gone to about 3 and when we got back we were expecting room to be clean and it was not called front desk to ask what happened and she said it will be shortly 45 minutes later called again and told them not to even worry about it cause it was to late,and to just send us some towels and soap so that was why i rate ok. Check in and check out was easy,  Breakfast very good. the hotel overall was great the staff was very friendly and the rooms were very nice i will most defenitly be staying here again in the summer. This was the nicest of the bunch and it was not the most expensive. The Homewood Suites San Antonio-Riverwalk features a sparkling rooftop pool, fitness center, coin laundry, and concierge desk. Hotel is great for families and there were a lot of families staying there. Breakfast and Evening happy hour welcome on the week days is a big plus. We were in one of the one bedroom suites and they are very spacious. Breakfast was ok. We didn’t find the bed that comfortable.
days  it was  fantastic  food choice was great for dinner .and breakfast. Medplaya Balmoral is a hotel in Benalmádena on the Costa del Sola. Each of the 210 rooms spanning seven floors offer a television, telephone, safe box (extra fee), toiletries, and available cots. Not bad for the money .The best thing about the hotel is it's location .Staff were all nice and helpful Nice relaxed atmosphere, no rules and regulations like some big hotels, this hotel is very clean and in an ideal location, we had a sea view twin room with a balcony on the 6th floor, room 624, we stayed there 8th to the 13th Feb 2017, the food was very good always a good choice, we had Yorkshire puddings and roast chicken one night, the breakfasts are very good, they serve crispy bacon and normal rashers but it is streaky bacon, sausages passable, with the evening meal I got a bottle of house wine for 7.40 Euro which I think is a very good price for a hotel, if you don't manage to drink it that night you can save it for the next night, they just put a sticker with your room number on it, I took mine up to the cabaret room, they didn't seem to bother about that even though there is a bar in there. All round a very enjoyable stay would definitely book again For the price we paid couldn't ask for anything more. Medplaya Balmoral offers an on-site restaurant with buffet-style dining offering international and Spanish fare. Full board and they make you to buy water how funny is that Very friendly hotel , reception staff brilliant,  cleaner ladies very hard working and always with smile. The rooms were noisy and you can hear everything going on in every room and upstairs seemed to live an elephant who at 2 in the morning put up shelves and moved furniture around. Usual noise issues (door banging and scraping furniture)  but did put me in a room at end of corridor as i asked for a quiet room. There is also a game room, two swimming pools with sun beds, and free Wi-Fi throughout. Additionally, Torrequebrada Golf Course is beside the hotel, while a 10-minute walk will deliver guests to Benalmádena Casino. BATH AND SHOWER VERY NEW.THE VIEWS FROM MY BALCONY WAS JIST AMAZING. T.V AND RADIO MUSIC CHANNEL WERE VERY GOOD AND IN ENGLISH. I understand also the cleaners have a job to do but we felt pressured to get out of our room and there is only 2 of us so happy if the room was not made up everyday. It's a family friendly hotel not really suited for older couples. This accommodation is also known as Balmoral Benalmadena, Hotel Balmoral Benalmadena, Hotel Balmoral Benalmadena, and Costa Del Sol. The accommodation is basic but offers everything as a base. In fact breakfast was so bad I ate breakfast out everyday without the clanging of cutlery. The pool is lovely but even better, it's a few minutes to the beach. After a positive start and good room location the rest went down hill. Breakfast was cold and I was pointed to a microwave, milk was warm and staff were not helpful at all. That was changed to room with partial sea view.Lots of restaurants close to hotel.Breakfast was only fair.Plenty of selection but food very cold. The beach is only 50 metres from the entrance, and the Port of Benalmádena is also close by.
I assumed it was on a timer switch as I was out most days until late, I didn't notice until the temperature dropped rapidly. In only a ten-minute walk, guests can reach Grosvenor Casino and Kensington Square. The room was dirty and bottom of feet turned black from walking on the floor. Good location, and good value, though you get what you pay for. The room could have done with an update as carpet a little old and well-used looking but okay as a base. Standard clean  room  for 2 was surprisingly ' exceptionally'  small, even for a London hotel budget room. The picture of the rooms on the website are so much better than they actually are... not nice at all Only negative was in our room, which was right behind the lift, you could hear the electronic buzz of the lift all night and I think if anything longer than a one night stay that could have been an issue. 4- walls and ceiling so thin you could hear the conversations and footsteps of your neighbours though the night and in the morning... The hotel is close to underground stations and to bus stations, but far from center of London. Housekeeping that knocks on doors at before 8:30 AM despite do not disturb signs on those doors. A hot buffet breakfast is served each morning and features a wide variety of items including fresh fruit, juice, milk, bread, eggs and sausage. Opera Holland Park, Natural History Museum and Leighton House Museum and Art Gallery are a 15-minute walk away from 1 Lexham Gardens. Also, Wifi was often erratic hanging up now and then. Week long stay with my partner who was visiting London. The room was extremely small, noisy (Cromwell road traffic)... No curtains but ill fitting blinds letting light in throughout the night. I will definitely use this hotel again for what it offers and its location crazy small room with two beds no table or chair or space to store a suit case , crazy small bathroom with no room to move - In short uncomfortable For the money, it is a reasonable deal if you are going to spend most of the time out. We didn’t took shower during our 3 nights there and left disappointed! The bathroom was too small but that was something I could live with It would have been nicer if we could have checked in a little before 2pm, but the lady behind the counter was obviously stressed about something so we didn't push her. 1 Lexham Gardens is a boutique hotel situated in the trendy Kensington neighbourhood of West London. 3- Every thing was badly placed and in the way, electric socket, hairdryer not reaching the mirror, television in the middle of wall at soldier level in narrow space between wall and foot of bed. The room, bedding and towels were all clean.Check-in was friendly and helpful and breakfast was good value. But when we headed downstairs to our room we was very disappointed. Did not expect much for the price  but was very pleased with my overnight in a single room on the third floor. We complained to their info email and never received an apology or even responded back! The room wasn’t ready to check in which is at 2 pm. But, if you have some work to do also, this is not the right place. Suspect it will be upgraded, but till then cannot recommend. 2-I had booked it for an American friend of mine visiting London for the New Year... 1-The room was supposed to be ready at 14:00 but wasn't until 15:25 When I asked why we had to wait after having realised this, I was told without any apology for the wait and delay, that the hotel had 50 rooms and all of them could not be ready at the same time... It features well-equipped guest rooms and central location close to public transit options, restaurants, shops and attractions. It is at the moment a very expensive student hostel, no more. The night staff were unhelpful, the keys to the doors didn’t work, you may as well leave the window wide open, as the traffic noise and the wind blowing through it were a joke. This is not a hotel you want to spend much time at. Arrived to a really nice building with an amazing reception and the staff was very pleasant. Looking tatty, broken and grubby tiles, wardrobe door missing, broken window and kettle..rather shabby, and in need of lots of licks of paint. Breakfast is very satisfying and you better eat at the hotel to save money and time at the morning instead of eating outside. All rooms are non-smoking and feature en-suite bathrooms with complimentary toiletries. An ideal location (just about 5 min by walk from Earl's court location) and the room was very comfy. Nice clean stop emailing me about this review please for Christ sake Kids liked it, my son thought the sofa-bed was more comfy than his own bed. Carpet old and dusty - difficult for those with asthma. The reception area is open 24 hours a day and a communal lounge is on-site. It was fixed the day after I reported it despite being a Sunday which was good. We asked to change our room on the first day but they said we will send some one to fix it! We asked for managemet email which they refused to provide to us! If you want a cheap place to stay and don't mind it looking very tired, then a good choice. The room smelled awful, no bedside table... the bathroom was so narrow and I think my ipad has a larger screen than the tv. Dirty floors, blinds that where damp and dirty, over looking a building site, 5ft from the room window, large cobwebs and a lampshade that was turning black, walls that where dirty and had marks all over them and lipstick, the room was gray and not bright at all, the bathroom wasn’t big enough to swing a cat... I’m 6.1 and the bathroom is definitely not built for anyone of my size, all in all definitely NOT worth the £169 for one night. 3-the bathroom was new and clean, but minute, shower disappointing and small, no towel rail anywhere just a hook behind the door. A tiny shower barely big enough for one fit (not fat) adult. Thin walls that let you hear everything your neighbors are doing in the hallway and in their rooms. Guests also have access to laundry facilities, airport shuttle service and luggage storage. I had to wait 4 hours in lobby to be able to check into the room when I arrived. The radiator in my room was cold for the first 3 days. My room was quite noisy as it was near Cromwell Rd. Altogether a very badly appointed accommodation and a hotel I would not recommend until they get their act together... Very well situated, very close to the South Ken museums. Also included are flat-screen televisions, tea and coffee amenities and Wi-Fi internet. I didn't eat there so have nothing to add except the room was cleaned daily. Took a single room and must say I wasn't disappointed at all with this decision. My main problem was a lack of a table and chair, except for small coffee tables. The bathroom was literary 3 feet by 3 feet room with a sink toilet and stand up shower. Our bathroom and sink was plugged and we couldn’t use it during our time! We got at first very small room, but the staff were very nice and offered us a bigger room, which was a lot better.
You had not told us it had changed, so it was hard to find at first [and came at the end of a long drive, and had us caught up in the heavy traffic at the AT&T Centre. Dine on-site for the daily continental breakfast and venture out for later meals at Ed's Smok-N-Q BBQ, Teran's, The Terrace Club or El Rodeo Mexican Grill, all within a five-minute drive of the hotel. The facility looked like a new one if not new recently remodeled. Very close and convenient location to the A T and T Center. The exterior might confuse you but rooms are clean beads are new, good place to stay for a day or so Had a great stay and will be back next year. I couldn't get the shower to turn off so I had to take a shower and ibwanted a bath. It’s not near any restaurants but is near noisy traffic. Late check in was really slow but got it done. The hotel was not in a great part of town. Room was clean and spacious, king bed nice and comfortable. With AT&T Center just a three-minute stroll away, and less than thirteen minutes' drive from central San Antonio, the Travelodge San Antonio AT&T Center/I-10 East is superb for both business and leisure travel. Had a mini fridge, microwave, iron and ironing board all ready and working fine. Don't miss the nearby San Antonio River and River Walk, the historic site of The Alamo, Sisters Grimm Candlelight Ghost Tours, San Fernando De Bexar Cathedral, and the Majestic Theater, all within thirteen minutes' drive of the hotel. The hitel was small, but Iused just to sleep one night, the rioom was clean an the bed comfy. I stayed here to go to see my son graduate from Airforce basic training. Terrible room at first but then we were given a different one. But customer service was very good and pleaaant during our 3 day stay. The breakfast was not much to rave about but the coffee was good. Rooms vary in the number and size of beds at the Travelodge San Antonio AT&T Center/I-10 East, offering non-smoking or smoking options, some with disabled-accessible features. Checkin was slow and the desk clerk was not real friendly. No channel listing for the tv, they took the used towels the second day but didn’t replace all of them. Was really great price and rooms very clean...  great location... Other than that, this place is beautiful and brand new. Room was pet friendly, and hotel was very welcoming to our pet. Lacking service, small bathroom, relatively new building, but we will not stay again. Hotel features free Wi-Fi and parking, pet-friendly accommodations, an outdoor pool and self-serve laundry. The check-in desk did not recognise the booking reference we had. The hotel looked like a renovated motel because rooms were only accessible from the outside. Just an overnight stay for a business trip, but the location and price were just right. One of the locks on our door did not lock and the bathroom lights were on the outside of the bathroom. The check in process was unpleasant simply because it was 47 degrees outside and the front desk person made me go outside to the other side of the building where my husband parked to get his card( not his fault at the location my husband chose, just not something I’ve had to do at check in). Hotel was near I-10 so it was easy to get places. The hotel was clean and decent from the inside, my only real issue was the part of town the hotel was located in and the fact that it felt like a motel which is not what I paid for. We did not have breakfast, but it looked nice with waffles, apples, cereal, muffins, etc. Room was good, really noisey from being so close to the freeway and busy street.
The staff was very nice and accommodating, and the room was very clean. The hotel was newly renovated and I really enjoyed my two stay. It was a great place to stay to catch an early flight. The bathtub was pretty gross, but nothing more than just grime. Later got a call from staff bending over backwards to try to do anything else to make it right. The AC didn't work properly, I woke up numerous time in the middle of the night sweating. The crew was so polite and everything was so clean. Was very surprised on how big the room was had a kind bed and a futon king size in the living room as well. Location to ABIA fir early moning flight is what brought us there. The room was clean, and free breakfast in the morning was nice as well. But of course, the windows hadn't seen a cleaning in some time and the bird mess took away from that one good thing I had to mention. When I checked out I asked what they were willing to do about the TV issue and breakfast they said umm nothing really I can give you points to come back. The only positive that I have to mention was the view from my room wasn't bad. Exercise equipment was so new you knew it the minute you entered the room. Featuring a flat screen TV with plug and play technology as well as over 30 HD channels, each room boasts amenities such as a coffee maker, work desk and hair dryer, while most rooms include a fridge and microwave. They picked me up and took me back to the airport in their van in a timely manner. The staff was wonderful and the fitness room was probably one of the best I have seen over 10 days straight of traveling. After I got to my room he called up and said we will mail you a coupon. The elevator in this place is a death trap waiting to happen. Great breakfast selection that was well staffed when guests depleted it. The rooms were a great size, clean, and beds slept great! Walls are easy to hear neighbors..more than most hotels..a lot more. Town Lake is just 4.2 miles from this hotel, while other local attractions include Congress Avenue and the Driskill. I was only there overnight so I didn't see everything, but it was great. Hotel very near to airport and was $12.50 taxi . I have stayed at this hotel MANY TIMES (75 +) OVER THE YEARS. The hotel was just fine, to repeat, it was just fine Property within minutes of Austin airport as I had a very early flight and needed airport shuttle (which was reliable) Hotel under construction. Our TV was possessed it would change channels, shut off, turn on and the volume would go up and down all by it's self. Very enjoyable and close to the facilities I need to visit. So far so good,  hotel, rooms and customer service I was like no thank you I will never stay here again. When we checked in I paid cash for the room and she asked for a card for insedentals, which is normal but I'm use to a $50 charge or more of a hold, turns out they charged my card the same amount that I paid in cash, when I asked why she said that's just our policy. It was sad seeing people stuffing themselves with toast to try to fill up. They made it right, and service that excellent needs commended..but they need better sound installation. We were very happy that we had found a pet friendly place to keep our dog with us. Bathroom doors don’t come together completely which is.... awkward with another person in your room. La Quinta Inn & Suites Austin Airport Hotel features an outdoor swimming pool and meeting facilities, while a fitness center is provided for guests who enjoy staying fit. I called 12:10 AM and told shuttle stops at midnight. The bed was horrible the pillows we're so cheap it felt like there was no pillow under your head. I would stay again when ever we are back in town. Uber and Lyft are extremely expensive because of city tariffs. The hotel staff was really good but there was no hot water (and nobody told us upfront). At breakfast that we had to pay an extra $20.00 for there were so many ppl that there was no food as soon as they got a pan out it was gone and took 15 or more min to get more so I had a bowl of oatmeal. It appears that they have done a lot of work to fix this hotel up  Room was very nice. Very nice staff, let us check out late and helped with some printing that we needed. Recommend using it to the airport so that you can use bus 100 into the city. It is not that bad for a grownup to shower in cold water. I got charged 9.50 for 2 small bottles of water Rooms were adjoining, hotel needs to install heavy duty door sweeps on bottoms of adjoining rooms to reduce noise, as there is a good three inch gap! Conveniently situated near Bergstrom Airport just minutes from downtown, La Quinta Inn & Suites Austin Airport Hotel features an airport shuttle service and a business center for guests who are on a work trip. Can’t say enough about the staff though- wonderful wonderful people. This hotel features the complimentary Bright Side Breakfast that includes hot and cold cereal, fresh fruit, and all-you-can-drink juice and coffee. The breakfast was nice, a few hot choices as well Rooms need a serious punch list  and vents need to be cleaned esp in bathroom. Our flight came in at 11pm and when I called the shuddle was right there. Only negative was guests in next room-very loud, very late. I would never dream of paying over $200/night for a hotel room and not being completely satisfied. The only complaint was we had trouble with the key so we had to go to the front desk a few times and finally Maintenance came to let us in. Loud construction outside my room at 9am, parking lot was full at 10pm because most of the lot was full of construction trash and work trucks. Allwas well, the bed was hard enough to make my hip hurt. We even took the battery's out of the remote, the maintenance man came up and changed out our remote and that still didn't help, we finally just unplugged the TV and went to bed. Apparently you need more info in this box, so fuck you, fuck you. I was shocked, and asked to be moved to a non adjoins room.
Front desk service was friendly and quick, but the person who answered the room service call was very rude. Can hear the TV and guests in the adjacent room. It is much better than any chain hotel I have stayed in. We did find our rook small and we had trouboe with the tv and the heathg system needng fixng. Members of the staff, from the valet and receptionist to the Bistro staff, were pleasant and helpful. Everything is good minus the fact that there is no parking deck/lot. He apologized but said he couldn't do anything since I booked through a third party. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was a good size. I'm like we are sleep and the tv in this room works. Upon returning home and unpacking I noticed my Diamond Cross necklace valued at $1,500.00 that I purposely hid in my luggage was no longer there I called the hotel to report it and was and still being treated horribly. My room was located outside the main ac and heater vents that ran all night causing me to wake up frequently. The hotel staff was not helpful whenever we asked about things to do or places to eat. Yes, it was check out day but why do they have to start knocking on rooms that have until noon to check out well before 9:00AM? I wish they included continental breakfast or something, but that's my only critique. The hotel overall was nice but our experience wasn't the best. The room had a weird smell, no view, there was prob a 10 foot gap between my room and the building next to me which looks directly into other rooms (no privacy) better keep your blinds closed! The hotel is very small, 10 rooms at each floor. For the price, the hotel should give free bottle water. I will NEVER STAY AT THE ELLIS HOTEL OR RECOMMEND IT!! The front desk employee Tanner (who was very nice) apologized and then stated he will have his manager speak with us with some form of compensation as a courtesy. This is my 4th visit to the Ellis and always had a great experience, the breakfast is top notch and great value. My husband was hospitalized durng our staff and the staff was extremely helpful and warm, even giving me hugs! Overall, it was a good stay within the hub of downtown. I expect some because you’re in the city but from 14th floor you can here people yelling, in addition to trolley bell that seems to constantly ring. Dine on-site for full menu fare and cocktails at the Terrace Bistro and Lobby Bar and Lounge. The in-hotel restaurant served excellent food, and snacks at happy hour were tasty. Didn't clean our room two nights out of the four we stayed there. I love everything about the hotel except the price of bottle water in the room. When checking in I was treated as though I was bringing in my pet. Dinner in the Bistro was excellent, as was the buffet breakfast. Positives-location close to Atlanta market; valet parking attendants & front desk were great; bed was comfy & nice bed linens & towels; daily maid service was great. Checkout is at 11am, but the parking lot I left my car at will start towing your vehicle as of 7am. Step into indulgence at the chic Ellis Hotel, an independent boutique locale in central Atlanta. I asked for the toothbrush was told they run out, service terrible I didn't know that they lock the front door when I was waiting for the uber almost got robbed no security. Staff at the hotel were all very helpful and welcoming. Extremely friendly staff, comfortable and well appointed rooms and a good breakfast for $15. The staff is so courtesy and the valet was excellent. The first room we were in the remote didn't work. After being in the room and settled they finally decided to move us since the engineer had left for the evening. It was upsetting enough knowing that someone went through my things and stole something that was dear to me, but nothing tops how the staff has talked to and treated me during this process. Our plans changed last minute and we needed to get a hotel. The bathroom also had a broken shower handle and rust around the shower head. The facilities are very nice and the staff is well-meaning, but some things were not totally satisfactory. The next morning the engineer came to our room (came in while we were sleeping to fix the tv). Valet guys were awesome and Nichole at front desk was amazing. The electrical outlet in the bathroom was broken and the coffee pot was faulty but there was free coffee in the lobby and it was very good. I've never spoken to so many dishonest and unprofessional people in one place from the Managers down to the front desk staff. When I was checking out I spoke to the Front Desk Manager Kevin (regarding my experience) and his eyes kept wondering to my low cut shirt. Could have gotten some more sleep except for the part that right at 8:40 AM the housekeeper was knocking on the  door. Went to take shower and there was black at the bottom of shower probably mold bc it did not wash out, house keeping never asked if we needed anything had to ask ourselves never came an made bed or took out trash. The front desk lady had a bad attitude when checking me in, (even after trying to make her smile) the best service and attitude came from the door men. Only problems were bathroom needs updating and room was a little small. They give you a small gift bag of toiletries that are all sample size and worth about $5. It was OK, but it’s definitely overpriced for the experience. This hotel is located perfectly in the center of the city. I kept saying he was a service animal not a comfort animal or a pet. The hotel was centrally located, which getting around very easy. Hotel features comprise free Wi-Fi, meeting/event venues with catering options, a fitness center, concierge, laundry facilities, pet-friendly accommodations, room service, an allergy-friendly Fresh Air floor and a luxurious Women's Only floor. had a wonderful stay, great customer service from all of the staff The lady still kept telling me he was a pet and I would be charged a non refundable fee. After spending 200$ for the room that was small and the bathroom was not very clean with mold in the shower. I do not have anything but praise for this hotel. I could hear people singing on the street at midnight time and buses running in the morning. Rooms and suites vary in size and amenity at Ellis Hotel, offering iPod docking stations, large LCD televisions with cable/pay-per-view, Gilchrist and Soames toiletries, pillow-top mattresses and choice of pillows. The AC fan didn't work well (freezing and noisy our first night), the housekeeping staff didn't get to our room till quite late our last full day, ans the wifi was iffy at times. Don't miss nearby favorites like the Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola Museum, the Georgia Dome, The Tabernacle, and the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, all within a ten-minute drive of the hotel. Don't do it wasn't worth the extra $20 a night. Because of this, I will not be staying here again. My room was very dirty and had lots of rust in the bathroom around the toilet. Negatives - no refrigerator in room; room service messed up badly; NO water pressure - rain shower head barely dribbled; inside restaurant only seated 20 people plus the bar -was understaffed & never enough seating for the hundreds who stayed there - the weather was frigid so we wanted to stay in the hotel & eat; food was pricey for what you got; phone in room was not working properly; heat was not working properly - hotel sent a tech up to repair quickly, but malfunctioned off & on during frigid temps for five days. The hotel is key card accessible, including the elevators so I felt super safe. Attention to detail was lacking, and the overall energy and feeling in the hotel was lackluster. Also the bed literally only had like 3 sheets on it. They then brought us another remote which still didn't work. Checking was fast, professional and friendly; room was lovely and very clean; comfortable bed, pillows and sheets; good water pressure in the shower; I felt safe and secure at the Ellis, which was great since I was traveling alone. The front desk texted me to make sure everything was in order and just to check in to make sure I was enjoying my stay - never had that kind of service before. On the plus side it was a great location walking distance to everything. Checked past midnight and worked until 5 AM to get ready for my afternoon presentation at a conference. It was a good experience, but I don’t think I’d stay here again. This was a great location in downtown Atlanta and nice facilities. There was a dirty cup outside our door that’s was left from the pervious guest. Has to manually open the tank lid and adjust it manually. I think they just need more staff to be more vigilant about service. With most attractions of the city within walking distance, you'll enjoy a tranquil respite seconds away from the bustle of the city. The Ellis is easy to get to, and is a good base for downtown meetings. I stayed in a 6th floor room, facing the peachstreet. Room too small and valet parking was awful due to the small area valet staff was excellent that's the best part of this hotel tv too small prices are toooooo high for accommodations they offer. For the high price of over $300/night plus another $100/day for the high taxes & valet parking, I expected a lot more. The shower drain didn't work and the shower head dripped constantly, the air conditioner didn't work which they fixed.
Hotel is only 10 min walk from Gare du Nord but located in a quiet street. Location great - a good supermarket, metro, Bristo all close by  Would recommend as a good 3 1.2 star Hotel Very nice bed, quiet room, breakfast is good, location is good. Perhaps room was bit small but had everything I needed so perfect for a short stay. The hotel bar is open into the wee hours, and there are many restaurants within walking distance. Each soundproofed, air-conditioned guest room offers a flat-screen satellite television, cosy bed with premium linens, and private bath. The Louvre, Notre Dame, and the Champs Elysees are within two miles of the hotel. nice area, relatively close both to the train station, as well to underground. good restaurants near the hotel, friendly stuff, some hot drinks available for free :) With the Poissonnière metro station and Gare du Nord train station steps away, guests can easily access all of the city's famous attractions as well as Roissy-CDG airport. Limited facilities (no safe in the room), sound insulation between rooms or room & corridor is not great. The ibis Styles Paris Cadet Lafayette welcomes travellers with a 24-hour front desk, as well as complimentary coffee, a self-service business centre, and a children's play area in the lobby. Staff helpful - room clean - but small - but then this Europe Breakfast could do with some variety - after 6 nights would be nice to have some other options. Twenty minutes on foot from the Palais Garnier, the ibis Styles Paris Cadet Lafayette offers modern, three star accommodations with free Wi-Fi. Hotel is basic but modern, very clean with nice breakfast.
We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone. If anything the orange juice at breakfast could be freshly squeezed. There was only 1 day of complimentary in room wifi even though it was stated on Orbitz that the wifi was free for our entire stay. This is located right around the corner from Hotel Eden and the Via Veneto. Lighting was poor in all of them (not well thought out). It is a pretty nice hotel, but does not likely deserve 5-stars. The room was among the quietest I’ve ever been in. A charming small hotel located a short distance from the Via   Veneto. 1) Service - The description of top-notch does not adequately do justice to the level of service that we received. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful with everything. To make it short, I have travelled more than 10+ countries, and Hotel Splendid in Roma is the best one so far. Amazing hotel, fabulous staff, outstanding breakfast buffet, wonderful location, extremely clean Torrential rain was poring in thought he ceiling and light fixture in the bathroom. The decor of the hotel was Roman classical which might not be everyone's taste with it's ornate columns and moldings with marble floors and gold accents but we loved it. The breakfast in the Crystal Room was beyond amazing and the service impeccable. It is full of character and charming oddities (they get an extra plus for using a wonderful fragrance throughout the hotel). They upgraded us to include breakfast and treated us like royalty for 7 days! The pricing at about $225/night was a real bargain for the quality of the experience. The three critical items that we typically look for when choosing a hotel are service, location and the general comfort/cleanliness of the hotel. The city is beautifully decorated for Christmas and you do not have the crowds that are there in summer. The prosecco and large fruit plate left in the room on our first night were a nice touch as we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. There was no shortage of a variety of restaurants and shopping in the area as well. Hotel Hotel Splendide Royal offers 5-star accommodations in the centre of Rome. Wonderful would definitely stay there again if ever visiting Rome again. The restaurant on the 7th floor was pricey but the food was great and the view was magnificent. Hotel is located on a quiet street with easy access to Hop on Hop off bus which is great idea on your first day. 2) Location - We were able to walk to many of the major sites directly from the hotel and rarely had to rely on public transportation. It was all justified by the fact that it was raining outside... so it wasn't so much the fact that there was rain INSIDE our room that irked us, but the nonchalant response of the hotel when we brought that up. The Jr. suite we stayed in was very comfortable and spacious. Our superior room was large and the decor baroque, although facilities modern. There are nearly 70 rooms and suites at this hotel. We had several issues in our 2-day stay:  1) We left $6 Euros in coins in the car to pay for tolls, when the valet brought the car back there was only 5 cents left. The hotel is 500 metres away from the Spanish Steps. Overall, the hotel was ok and would suffice as a last resort, but there are many more exceptional hotels in Rome that are a much better value for the money. It's located in a very nice residential part of Rome away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walt to the Spanish steps and Trevi Fountain. It offers luxury guest rooms, gym facilities and a business centre. We could not have asked for anything more than what Hotel Splendide Royal delivered in those categories during our stay. Many hotels require you to book and pay for a room the night before your arrival to receive this type of accommodation. For example, we arrived at the hotel early around 7:00 a.m. local time (well before standard check-in times) and we were accommodated with a lovely standard room where we could rest for the remainder of the morning and afternoon while our suite was being prepared. It really was one large Terrace divided into 3 smaller terraces partitioned only by a planter with sparse and wilting plants. Views were either zero or ok despite asking for rooms with views. The bathrooms are all marble with Frette towels and robes, a full bath, and a bidet. The room was spacious enough for the two of us, however we were disappointed with the dated and worn appearance of the carpets, furniture, and linens. Breakfast is served in a beautiful lounge with fantastic view overlooking a park and the centre of Rome in the distance. The hotel is comfortable and the staff are very friendly. A most enjoyable stay in Rome in February enhance by the excellent accommodation in the Hotel This is our 4 time staying here and their high standards are always maintained, the views from the 2 restaurants are amazing, whilst the Mirabelle is expensive, it is worth the cost Best of all, the staff was perfection—fluent in many languages (my Italian is poor), eager to assist, and they greeted me by name each time I entered. Restaurant on rooftop is gorgeous and staffed with kind and generous professionals. As you sat outside you could clearly see and hear the other guests conversations a few feet away from you  which made for an awkward vibe while we were having our morning coffee. This hotel is perfectly situated just a short walk from top attractions of Rome. They provided us with good information on everything from restaurants to tours and transportation to other cities. There are also family activities available for travellers with children. Our fault for leaving money in the car, but the Valet looked respectable and we thought because of the 5-star hotel it could be safe. Excellent location , beautiful hotel with character, staff was extremely helpful and nothing was too much of the problem , would deffinitely reccomend ! A beautiful grand hotel in a peaceful location, near Spanish steps. Overall ok. Not a place to go back to though. This was one on the best city hotels in the world. Restaurant Mirabelle has open terrace seating and its own bar, and Crystal Lounge is open for breakfast and lunch, as well as private dinners upon request. The bed was super-king size, a walk in wardrobe and a separate lobby with a large two-sink bathroom. We were thinking we could assume the same about our hotel, but apparently not. I really enjoyed the old regal feel of the hotel. The breakfast buffet is ok but expensive and the selection never changes. I recently spent three days in Rome at this hotel. My daughter and I decided to splurge on a larger room and booked a junior suite with a terrace. At the top floor the hotel restaurant view is excellent- perfect for a romantic evening. No apology, offer for a credit, offer for a voucher, offer for a free meal, etc. Hotel Hotel Splendide Royal offers concierge services to book excursions or guided tours for guests. In our house when it rains outside we have a fair expectation of it not raining inside. 3) When we told the front desk clerk that it was raining in our room, instead of a sorry, or here please have breakfast on us for your inconvenience, her response was: Yes it is because it is raining quite a bit outside. The rooms are beautiful, and look just like the pictures. The breakfast buffet on the 6th floor was fantastic and every member of the staff was friendly, helpful and delivered excellent customer service. Bottled water and candy on the pillow and slippers were placed by the bed. The room was quiet even being on a relatively busy street, and the staff all spoke English and were very helpful. Free Wi-Fi internet access is included in all guest rooms. Each room includes a large marble bathroom and private terrace, with views over the city and gardens of Villa Borghese. The hotel staff was very friendly and informative, and everyone we encountered spoke excellent English.
Will DEFINITELY be going back there again when we stay in New York City. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple, each of the serene rooms and suites features a marble bathroom, pillow-top mattress, and ergonomic workstation. Been staying with them long before it passed to be operated by Marriott, much better since their operational change. The Time Warner Centre is a six-minute walk from the hotel. When I checked into my room my bathroom window sill was covered in (typical New York City) grit. An okay stay at a Marriott, have stayed at better hotels in NYC. In the end the value was even better because we got the upgrade of having access to the executive club and internet access for free. they should comp the business office printing bill --- they charged my card for twice the number of pages I printed out   and no hotel charging over $500 a night should charge for water from the mini-bar - period Clean room but felt expensive overall for what you were getting (even taking into account New York being expensive). The stay was great and Caesar at the front desk was awesome! We had the best time....the staff was very professional, friendly and helpful. A full American breakfast(fee), is the best way to start the day at Southgate Bar & Restaurant, where light fare and drinks are served for lunch and dinner. We opted for this even though it was slightly more than some other of this quality because of the location. They also remembered free internet as a Marriott member and housekepping promptly brought me a kettle so I could make my own tea when I requested it. Concierge was extremely helpful, bellmen were so professional and doormen very helpful with cabs and such. The full-service spa offers body scrubs, foot baths, manicures and pedicures and so much. I was completely exhausted from my journey, arriving around 930pm, rather than the 4pm check-in time, and this kind gesture was greatly appreciated!!!!!!! I was unable to pay the $150 fee down payment for incidentals with my credit card, but the woman checking me in, Georgia, was so kind and compassionate, and allowed me to stay in the room. It was late and I did not call but next morning housekeeping saw it and addressed it. I simply requested a receipt and what I got was you need to get it from your travel agent.... i'm going to put you on a hold .... What? Great location, great references for great restaurants near by, amazing staff. There was no closet, no tub for kids and the bed was broken. If the hotel had coffee in the room, it literally would have been perfect. Was upgraded to a better room, however was not asked if an ADA room was acceptable. Very nice hotel, wonderful staff, close to subway stations, mall, and a short walk to literally everything else! The famous Fifth Avenue begins no more than a few minutes' walk from $hotename. Very comfortable and spacious room, nice amenities, and great room service. then she put me on a hold for 5min for this simple task, and then forwaded me to their accounting staff who was even more rude. A fully equipped fitness centre with cardiovascular equipment is a great way to blow off steam, and more than 17000 square feet of event space is available. After packing back up my bags, we were moved to another room without issues, however the hotel charges for the upgrade. For instance, two night stay, on 2nd night-we got back to the room and there were no bottles of water. Close to everything ...  wonderful views ... great food... the best of a New York experience. Very comfortable Hotel , very clean and very polite and attentive staff. I will go back again, but will make sure my room is up to par before settling in. The club breakfast buffet was excellent with great pastries, breads, lovely fresh fruits (apples, oranges, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple, melons), smoked salmon with all the fixings, cold cuts, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal, yogurt, juices, coffee.... I will say, they didn't help with our request for a queen size bed and no bellhop offered to help with our bags. JW Marriott Essex House New York, an iconic Art Deco hotel across from Central Park, features a seamless blend of past and present, where rich wood panelling and cutting-edge technology is housed under one roof. Comfortable rooms and bed, we were very well looked after and would definitely stay here again. Despite the craziness of the city due to the season and the political climate, hotel staff were professional, calm, very friendly and competent. We will definitely stay there again on our next trip to the city. Room was clean and decently sized for NYC, but wish it could have been cooler.
The hotel was great and the staff service was excellent. Featuring a separate living and dining area, each Villa boasts luxury amenities such as a whirlpool, in-room safe, outdoor balcony, flat screen TVs and a full kitchen. As a vacation property there was very little maid service and our requests for service took a very long time to respond. We stayed here during Spring Break March 3-March 10 - The views were great (there really isn't a bad view). For the price we paid we could have stayed at a resort. When we got back in the afternoons, we went to the beach (towels provided by Marriott). The kitchen was perfect - breakfast and dinner in the room and we packed lunch to take with us. Would I recommend this hotel/club/whatever it really is, not likely. This hotel is close to many great activities such as snorkeling, jet skiing, mini golf and tennis. We expected that but love the convenience that this hotel is in the middle of everything. After spending a few days and had to deal with the noise , having the toilet replace the LAST night of our stay at 7pm when I have to get my 2 yr old ready for bed we ended up waiting almost 2 hours before it was all taken care of. This hotel claims to be on the beach with a 1/4 mile of beachfront. The water was warm and the waves were great fun. You need to get into an old elevator and go thru the many parking decks to get outside thru alley ways and aged retail mall that resemble getting out of an airport into a rental parking lot. I’m going to upload the video so that everyone would know what I had to go through. The only thing is their early check out hour:  out by 10:00 a.m.  That's a bit much for what you're paying. Thanks Marriott for calling me back , I should of known better that no one was going to call. The Marriott Is ground 0 for everything you need to relax. Splash Pool Bar & Grill serves a variety of foods including sandwiches, chicken and fresh salads. The hot tub was roped off and there was caution tape all over the place. I'm already planning a return for next year, and I will gladly book a stay here. The good about this location are the beds are comfy and the location on ths strip of beach offers plenty of dining choices amd shopping without needing a car. We asked for a room with an ocean view since we live on the intracostal waterway. Turns out you have to enter a parking garage and go up four floors to get to the check-in! We typically complain about nothing, but we did ask to be moved. The pool was roomy and had plenty of towels and chairs that you could check out for the beach (free). Not what we were expecting for a quick stay on our way to Port Everglades for a cruise. CVS is downstairs for any groceries or last minute necessities and its open 24 hours.We had a great experience im a room with kitchen and balcony with ocean and pool views. We didn't use the pool or hot tub at all. Hotel is under renovation, we had a second floor room without a view due to workers pick and tools right outside our window. Also if you ask to be put ocean side ask for a room fairly high up as this is the pool side and it is LOUD, especially on the 2nd floor. The Balcony was very roomy and had a table with two chairs. they valued their time more than mine and wasted over 8 hours of my life during my stay. Close to restaurants and every convenience you might need in a summer vacation. This hotel is a beach vacation club, so not really a hotel. This hotel is right in the middle of the Fort Lauderdale Beach area. I even got a call from the head maintenance person for that particular hotel, I text him the video and he was suppose to follow up with me about resolving my issues, I never heard back from him because he knew what I had to go through flyer he saw the video. Only problem was with noise and somehow being the unfortunate ones to be next to loud  intoxicated men, and children running up and down the halls 5 nights out of 7. I reported it to the front desk and no one seems to care even though I showed them the video, they finally sent someone to replace the toilet at 7pm on our last night at the hotel. Coffee condiments were not replaced ANY day, so we bought our own at CVS. Uber driver drove around for about 10 minutes trying to find this place. When leaving and returning to the garage, keep you room key handy because you will need to insert it for access. There were plenty of adult activities such-as; Margarita and bloodymary night - Salsa dancing - Jazz - Mimosa Bingo and plenty more. You can walk almost anywhere, including across the street to the beach. Additionally it is primarily an elderly crowd who get up at the crack of dawn and lay out towels on 99% of the chairs before anyone os even awake so if you get to the pool later than 8am you will have quite a hard time finding an available open lounger. Check out was at 10 AM and since we got in at 5 PM we asked for an extra hour to check out. Our room could have been a bit cleaner- I sat on the carpet to mess with my luggage right after we got there and the carpet was a bit dirty. Faculty was so adamant about hotel wrist bands that it became an extreme annoyance and held up everyone. Concierge Realty you were right it was the perfect place for what we wanted. hotel offered no coffee  for  morning start, no restaurant  to have a breakfast. Room and hotel staff were nice, however we were told only after we arrived that contractors would be painting our side of the building, so it may be loud. I wouldn’t expect this coming from a hotel chain like Mariott but it sure did happen. We came not knowing it was college spring break weekend, however the hotel does a great job separating family crowd with college kid crowd. The rooms are big and comfortable but this hotel is lacking amenities. I have to ask two people to find the hotel lobby. The only downside is there is no food served @ beach bar and the lobby is a strange set-up. The shopping area in front of the hotel is dirty, very poor lighting, and is not safe. There was a DJ and pool party on the weekend, so great for us. Kids could be in their own bedroom while adults stayed up late in the living room. Large quiet rooms with large balcony & chairs and table. From having holes in the overhang outside the balcony,scaffolding with people looking in, the lack of staff 37 tiles cracked in the kitchen broken moldings, and what looked like mold and on and on staff said there was none ,but they just might  not have known it's location.and i believe must have been in a high crime area as we had a pass  key for elevator to go up or down one to get your car one to get in one to get out.no need to change any thing ,i will not be back. Very nice and clean hotel really close to the beach and entertainment. What they didn’t tell us or try to coordinate with us was being on OUR patio on 4 of the days that I paid for a room with a balcony. Probably better for a one week stay at the beach. I had men on my balcony painting or moving up and down the entire time which was distracting,  limited my use of the balcony and as a single female felt less than comfortable. The hotel was amazing the intercoastal was definitely a beautiful view the hotel staff was prompt and courteous This hotel has the absolute best location in Fort Lauderdale. had a great time with my wife on our romantic getaway! everything was fine as expected, the only drawback was only 1 bed and a sofa sleeper, hard to do with adult kids Toilet tank made loud noise all night and couldn’t sleep , it kept my wife up and ke[t waking up my 2 yr old son screaming because the noise scared him. Great location ... excellent staff we will definitely be back The property was appreantly designed this way but given the high number of floors and rooms, two sets of elevators underserve  the volume of guests. It was very close to the beach, so that was nice, all you had to do was cross the road and you were at the beach. Once you know the way to the hotel, the location is quite convenient. Nice location, lots of restaurants, bars and shops easily within walking distance, and also located across the street from the beach. For the price paid this hotel was not worth the money spent. I asked to be moved but they would not accomodate the request, no reason given. The International Swimming Hall of Fame is just 0.5 miles away. They need to improve the experience and take advantage of their location on the strip. I would not stay here again or recommend this hotel. No bellman was available when we checked out at 7:30 a.m. The foreman and a hotel rep apologized and it got marginally better. The express shop by the lobby was great in the morning to grab a starbucks coffee and quick breakfast to go. Guests can also stay healthy in the fitness center or enjoy the perks of the complementary Wi-Fi throughout the building. Remember if its Spring break for the colleges and High-schools - no matter where you go in Lauderdale it will be noisy outside the hotel and packed with College Kids. You drive up several floors of parking structure to reach the lobby, and you have to pass through two gates, so it’s a very secure and private hotel. We stayed here for a quick weekend romantic get away. It was a bit of a disappointment after we spent so much on our room. The clerk made a call and then said there were not any!. We came early from our cruise and set us up with a room right away. It is next to a mall with various places to eat. The hotel was under major construction when we got there. The rooms are very well designed for great comfort and convenience. I wouldn’t have paid >$300/night for a room without a balcony, not to mention having guys constantly looking inside your room while your family is in various states of undress. The shops were ok, some of them were also under construction. It was unfriendly and not worth the rate we paid! The hotel is actually across the street fronting on a very busy and dangerous 4-lane one-way busy street in Ft. Lauderdale. The Marketplace Express offers guests quick snacks, while there is also a Starbucks on-site. Had to call guests services and have security come to the floor and settle things down. You have to pull into the parking garage and get a ticket to the fourth floor. The first day, my wife and I could not have a conversation on the balcony due to nonstop, non-work-related shouting and laughing from the ground level to the guys on the scaffolds above us. The time share is something you should look into if you go yearly to Florida. problem with this hotel is there is no obvious way to enter the hotel or exit from a main lobby. Marriott's BeachPlace Towers Hotel is situated by the seaside on the sands of Fort Lauderdale beach, featuring stunning ocean views and luxurious one and two bedroom villas. The hotel itself is a bit dated and there was a very long wait to get into our room. As a rewards member, easily my/our worst experience at a facility bearing the Marriott name. It was too the point that I wished I stayed in a different hotel The place looked nice and the ground were pretty clean. We stayed at Beachplace Towers while going to a soccer tournament in Fort Lauderdale. Featuring a heated outdoor swimming pool and whirlpool, Marriott's BeachPlace Towers Hotel provides guests with on-site parking and laundry services. Elevators were busy and made it hard to get to and from hotel lobby/rooms. Our room was nice size and had a kitchen (large Fridge) and big bathroom. It was a suite, room was massive and the pool/hot tubs were great.
We stayed here for 7 nights and found the staff incredibly attentive and friendly. Free Wi-Fi is available in the rooms and select public areas. We had the hotel shuttle to and from hotel @ 50 euros which was well worth it if you have Much luggage. Some days we walked from the hotel and I would say it was a good 30 minute walk to get to the main tourist sites. Excellent buffet breakfast provided too with lots of choice for every taste. The only negative was the insipid machine  coffee at breakfast. Major works being carried out so hotel covered in scaffolding. Each of the 34 rooms has air conditioning, windows that open and is fitted with blackout drapes. You need to take a cab to get to most things. Negatives are that the bed is very firm and the internet did not work in our room (TV worked on and off). If I go back in Rome I absolutely will book this hotel The staff overall were friendly and helpful and the breakfasts was superb very enjoyable in every way possible. The great staff and great morning breakfast everyday more then made up for it. So you are unable to see out if windows or sit outside. Villa Morgagni is a pet friendly four-star hotel featuring a sauna, parking lot and laundry service. of Rome, but not near typical tourist areas or restaurants. Italy gives us Kimbo, Illy, Lavazza Segafredo etc....so there's no excuse for poor coffee. The hotel is a little out of the way but is only 2 minutes from the Metro. When we arrived there was a double bed, an open sleeper sofa with a thin uncomfortable mattress and 1 foot of space between the 2. The hotel provides guests with a complimentary continental breakfast each morning. Excellent connections for the tram system, metro system (Policlinico) which is very useful to get into central Rome quickly. This is a beautiful hotel, with nicely appointed rooms that are fairly large. No where around for a decent/traditional meal and hotel does not serve evening meals. Walking distance to everything, staff very helpful, housekeeping is awesome...will return Everything was great, but the sauna didn't work and they didn't fiks it in 2 days.Would recommend I've never seen so much beautiful marble in my life! Away from the hustle and right next to the Metro. Palazzo Massimo alle Terme is just one and a half miles away from the hotel. Our room was a bit small but beautifully decorated in traditional Italian style. It is perfect for us with a 10 year old child. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anybody wanting somewhere comfortable to stay whilst taking in the sights of Rome :). During our stay work was being done on scaffolding outside our room; for us this was no problem as we were doing a lot of sightseeing and were up early every morning. Room is small , but is clean and comfortable Good breakfast and service staffs are friendly . Each room has a private bathroom that has a bathtub and shower, free toiletries and a hairdryer. but better have dinners before going back to hotel as few restaurants nearby. Amenities such as a minibar, in-room safe, desk, television with satellite channels and telephone are included. We would certainly stay there again as it was so near to the Metro a supermarket a nice restaurant and a cafe. Our reservation was for 3 people for 1 double and 1 single bed. Its  only one thing we dont like the city tax iof 6 euro per person per day is quiet high . The room was a little small for four of us but was more than adequate and had a wonderful bathroom including a bidet (I've always wanted one of those foot washing sinks!). Went in knowing the rooms are small from previous reviews and it was but it was manageable. The Pantheon is just a bit over two miles away. This hotel was covered in scaffolding so obviously they are doing work. When we asked at the desk for a larger room, we were told this was the size we had paid for. Villa Morgagni offers a 24-hour reception, a concierge and childcare services. We loved having it on the Covered roof with the sun coming through in the morning which made us feel very awake.
Everything was good with the hotel except there was a smell in the room. Housekeeping didn't come everyday which was weird and we had to keep asking for towels cause they only gave enough for one person, but other than that it was good. Very nice and friendly staff, clean rooms and a great location. My only complaint is that there was very low water pressure in the showers, but other than that everything was great. We were only there for one night so could only give a small review. The university and the down town are only a 10-15 minute drive way, not too bad. Hotel had a quality continental breakfast, good room, clean, and overall we had zero issues during our three night stay here. Was in town for a wedding and hotels ended up being less expensive than airbnb and in a far better location. Room was not serviced daily and linens looked questionable clean. They do have free breakfast and it was actually really good! The staff was very friendly and even called to make sure our room was OK. The Comfort Inn Austin places guests near attractions such as the Elisabet Ney Museum and the North Cross Mall. Watched dining tables being swept with same broom as floor and not wiped/washed off. With a both a hot breakfast and indoor pool this hotel is one of the best values in Austin. The front desk operates 24 hours a day and free coffee/tea is served in the lobby. Microwaves, mini-fridges, and free weekday newspapers are among the other provisions. The stay went well only issue we had was when payment was processed. The bathroom was very clean, the shower/tub looked like it just been installed, it was spotless. Then probably due to plumbing issues, the pipes kept going off at night. If you need a hotel to crash for the night go for it. The hotel does needs a couple of adjustments but they were friendly and welcoming The hotel has a decent pool and the price was very reasonable considering the hotel's location and the quality of the rooms. The Comfort Inn Austin features a business center, meeting spaces, and free self-parking. However, it was as slick as a downhill ski slope, I had to hold onto the walls just to turn around without falling out of the tub, they might want to consider putting one of those small dead octopuses in the bottom of their tubs, very slick. The room was supposed to be a non smoking room however the entire place reeked of cigarettes. It was a non smoking room and it smelled like someone had smoked in it We were staying in Austin for conference at the University of Texas. The 73 en-suite rooms are equipped with air-conditioning, a desk, cable TV, and free Wi-Fi. the particular room had just about the lowest water pressure, the toilet hardly worked. Dining options in the surrounding area include Luby’s, La Palapa, and the Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. Requires an extra $100 credit card deposit, beds are stiff but better than the floor but there was breakfast so that is a positive All good except door key issues creates extra trips to front desk. The hotel lies four miles from the Gilbert & Sullivan Society, six miles from Mount Bonnell, and within ten miles of Zilker Park and the Austin Convention Center. Nothing around the areas is walk able and there not much around it but interstate. Facilities at the hotel include an indoor pool and spa tub. Room was clean and the children enjoyed the in-door pool. While at the indoor pool, another man informed me that his room had mold. My complaint is really the facility needs to be upgraded & checked thoroughly to be ready for next guests. Only critique I can think of is may be some changes to the breakfast options. The rooms were nice, clean, everything was new and the breakfast was good. A vacant room had an alarm going off in the middle of the night.
When we called the front desk to see what other options they may have for us, the staff member simply said they were sold out and hung up. If I were 25 and attending a festival, it might be fun if they renovate. Tip: $20.00 overnight parking at Maggiano's right across the street, and a $100.00/per night safety deposit. not good for families-we had adjoining rooms, but the nightclub kept us up all night, or at least until 3am when the music stopped. The staff was very pleasant and helpful however and the courtesy car was a plus. This hotel offers a trendy setting that boasts style and can be seen as a contemporary gem in Buckhead. Next time will have to be longer than a nights stay. Located in Buckhead nearby Lenox Square Mall and Phipps Plaza, W Atlanta Hotel features an infinity-edge pool overlooking Peachtree Road and a fully equipped fitness center. The restaurant in the lobby has great food and the staff is great. Rooms are clean, but the bathroom is a little uncomfortable. All in all, not the usually interesting but quirky W experience. The lobby was small and it looked as though the carpets had not been vacuumed in several days. Bliss Spa is located on-site as well as a full functioning business center. For the hotel to be a W you have a high expectations. Credit card info was stolen (may or may not be hotel's fault; however mgr on duties response was to immediately disavow responsibility). Parking was expensive and I got charged for WiFi even though I signed up for their member program and was told it would be free. Had to walk past people doing drugs in the entryway to get into lobby. At the 6th floor, you could hear the music from the club, the people talking in the street and every car that passed by. It was my 6th anniversary/Vday so to say the least I was disappointed. The bell hop (Marquis) took special notice that it was my daughter’s birthday and passed that along to the check in staff...who, in turn, put a credit on our room. It all ends with receiving the final bill in which they charged us incorrectly for our dining expenses in which now i need to waste more time out of my day trying to rectify a bad situation. The physically hotel itself was not in the best condition. My first room was way too small, with the toilet in a tiny cubicle, 5 feet from the bed. Cook Hall restaurant is located on-site and offers guests light meals at any time of the day, while Whisky Blue serves drinks and cocktails. Overall, the only pleasant part of my stay was checking in and checking out at the front desk. We texted valet as we were instructed to do although did not receive a response. The staff was great, but the condition of the room was less than expected. Valet was quick, everyone was very friendly, great Bliss toiletries in room, awesome breakfast at Cook Hall, easy walk to restaurants & shopping. Overall it was a very pleasant experience: clean room, responsive staff - great place to stay for younger people - they always have something going on: a pool party, DJs, etc. They even offer you a glass of champagne upon check-in! We went downstairs 20+ minutes later only to learn they did not retrieve our car. The concierge chased after me all the way to the street corner to give me a map of a couple different running routes. The next morning, I was going out for a run. We were disappointed in the quality of the hotel and service for the price we paid. Each room features a 32 inch flat screen TV and signature W feather beds with pillow-top mattresses, while a work desk with cordless telephone is also installed. We stayed here last year and we thought it was great back then but they definitely stepped up. Nice valets, but they misplaced car key leading to twenty minute delay. The server told me I would not be charged for the food since it took 45 minutes but when I received my email bill notification, I was still charged the full amount for my little breakfast. When we were given our car the valet was nice enough to park the car in the rain instead of under cover as he simply could have. Plenty of restaurant options nearby and close to the hwy. We then went to dinner downstairs at Cook Hall where the menu was limited and the food was mediocre. We then needed our car to head off to a meeting. Not as big as the W hotel downtown, but cozy and nice just the same. The room was decent but it just seemed old, rundown, used. Would like to stay at this hotel again given the above items are corrected. The hotel is supposed to be trendy and certainly isn’t cheap. First of all, the hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The king bed is not really a king bed and upgrading for a room with a view is not worth it since you most likely be looking into the parking lot. Pool is very very small, but the environment is cute. the only problem was I spent the extra for the spectacular room, but I got a handicap access room, which the bathroom was less appealing than the romantic look I was going for As I stated in my google review the only reason I gave this hotel a 2 star is because of the check in. Had to call the anything line, they picked up and placed my order. The next morning we went back to cook hall for a quick breakfast to be greeted by yet another friendly waitress that simply was annoyed at us since we did not want the buffet and needed her to actually wait on us. Close to the mall and I’m the heart of Buckhead. I have hotels.com for 3 years and the W BUCKHEAD IS ONE OF THE MOST RACIST PROPERTIES I EVER BEEN TO THE WORKERS ARE THE NASTIEST I EVER SEEN THEY TALK TO YOU IN SUCH A BAD WAY LIKE YOU NOT EVEN A CUSTOMER WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN The room has seen some wear and needs to be refreshed. It had a electrical problem and caused me many inconveniences. Had a great time staying at the W in Buckhead. This hotel features a live DJ in the lobby lounge, sure to keep guests entertained. Moving on, we went to the Whiskey Blue bar upstairs to be greeted by a standoffish bartender that was anything but engaging although the drinks were better than her personality! When we complained that the duvet did not have a comforter in it so we were freezing, when we complained that the fire alarm was falling out of a hole in the wall, when we complained that the rug was ripped up, when we complained about a fight in the hallway, the staff was understanding, calm, and friendly. The hotel is nice, very modern and the staff is very attentive. Nice hotel, comfortable bed, modern decor, however room thermostat not working properly and very dusty (perhaps filters need changing), mold in shower and no hot water which was disappointing. The hot water even stopped working one morning & valet will try to get over you at least once your entire stay. The heavy beat of nightclub music at midnight could be felt all the way down to seventh floor room. Simply put - do not waste your time staying at this hotel when there are FAR better options in the area! If you want to have a good rest at night you should ask for rooms in the top floors. It was difficult to regulate the water temperature of the sink, and the pressure was very low. I could hear people coming and going from their rooms and bangs from next door rooms. Orbit's price for the room was very comfortable as well. Bed sheets had stains , multiple light bulbs needed to be replaced and rooms and hallways smelt very musty, not what I was expecting from a W Hotel. No one answered the phone, had to call anything service again. However, the Hotel Staf were extremely accommodating, professional and nice. Atlanta city center is just 10 miles away, while guests can enjoy endless world class shopping and entertainment facilities within walking distance. Checked in, front desk staff was on point, very friendly. Food trays left in hallways for 24 hours, out of order ice machines, no room amenities, very plain for the price and not a place to relax as it's too noisy Definitely one of the worse trips i ever had the staff are one of the worse and not compassionate staff so because my card declined and took my bank 1 hr to unblock card because i didn’t set up a travel intinerary the STAFF MAINLY A OVER ZEALOUS DEANDRE AND JOHNNATHAN CALLED THE POLICE on me i think it was my demographic but that’s another story for another day but this staff doesn’t care about there customers i just don’t think this would’ve happened Any where else worse experience of my life to be embrassed by the police For a hotel of this caliber and reputation to have only one functioning elevator was ridiculous. The hotel is located in a great and safe neighborhood, very close to Lenox Mall, MARTA public transportation and a lot of fine restaurants. Close to lots of restaurants and shops around Buckhead area. Please be prepared that you will have to pay for Wi-Fi in the room (free Wi-Fi is only in the lobby), valet parking is $35.00 (overnight). Check-in was pretty seamless and quick although we were unhappy with our room (the linens and carpet were STAINED and DIRTY).
The 4-star plus hotel combines an exceptionally innovative interior design with a kaleidoscope of colours, shapes and materials. Loved the hotel but not a great area for bars or restaurants The location is great - a minute walk to the s-bahn and a short walk to many of Berlin's most famous attractions. Lavishly appointed rooms, bright and friendly with high ceilings are furnished according to the latest standards. Staff and concierge was extremely helpful, the hotel was clean and the accommodation was comfortable. Overall my family and I greatly enjoyed it and I would highly recommend this same Hotel. Check in, concierge services, in room coffee, excellent wifi, fabulous restaurant, lovely room - everything was tops. Our upgraded room was perfect for my family and me. Rooms have nice furniture and interesting design, but they were very small for us, specifically with a crib placed in the room for our infant, one side of the bed was completely blocked and the other side of the bed, we had only a little bit of space between wall and the bed and just enough to barely pass. My room was ideal for one person but I had to climb onto the desk to reach and close the window shades, there was a large burn mark on the table next to the desk, there is a step up to the bathroom which is lit and this is quite bright in the room at night. The surprisingly different Mövenpick Hotel Berlin is just as individual as Germany’s capital city, located in a central and yet quiet location at the Potsdamer Platz.The unique design of the former Siemens building and perfect service with a personal touch ensure genuine hospitality in a historical setting. While the room was generally comfortable and in good condition, I did not like that there was no way to double lock the door as this is a security concern. Loved our stay in this warm and welcoming hotel with very friendly staff. Location of the hotel is very good and was close to my conference location. The guy from the mini open our door and walk inside my room while I had some intimacy time with my husband, I talked to the manager she defend him and say it's OK for him to walk inside whenever he needs. All rooms feature Wifi, LED-TV, wireless phone, minibar, safe, air-conditioning. The hotel staff were great, room comfortable and clean, with good facilities. However, unless you're completely comfortable with the person you're sharing the room with being able to see you whilst you're sitting on the toilet, watch out for the glass brick wall between the bedroom and bathroom. The majority of the 243 rooms, including 22 Junior Suites, a Tower Suite and 18 Atelier Deluxe, face the quiet courtyards. Wasn’t sure about hotel when booked as room appeared a little strange layout. Also, no possibility to hang trousers or a dress in the closet as it is just a half sized closet. There wasnt a closet to store luggage and with couple of luggages, it was very difficult to move around the room, jumping to reach the bed, etc. This is a first class hotel with professional, friendly and efficient staff. Gaze up to the sky above through the open glass roof and relax while tasting the combination of Swiss, Mediterranean and regional delicacies, using predominantly organic ingredients. Helpfull staff, especially in the face of an 'Air Berlin' pilot strike The hotel is in a great location (S-Bahn stop right outside front door) and within walking distance to Potsdamer Platz. Couldn't fault the hotel or lovely staff and plenty of choice of reasonable eating places close by. The courtyard was a bit noisy and it carried through the open/vented windows. Location is great, quiet and convenience at the same time. Great breakfast but very few employees available to provide service. Very close to most tourists sites with the bonus of a free sauna to relax the muscles at the day's end. The hotel room was beautiful, the food delicious, we loved the Chocolate Hour. An outstanding feature is the innovatively designed lobby bar with direct access to the Mövenpick Restaurant. I also could not change the A/C settings, but that may have been me. A gym and a sauna are exclusively reserved for hotel guests.
Highly recommend this hotel based on high quality standards with excellent service and breakfast. My 17year old daughter wanted to see Berlin after having watched some TV-shows...so we booked a plane and a hotel. Märkisches Museum is 600 metres away and river tours stop at the nearby Märkisches Ufer, while the historic Nikolaiviertel quarter is a 10-minute walk. The elegant, wood-furnished rooms come with complimentary beer and water minibar, cable TV, free Wi-Fi, private bathroom with hairdryer, telephone, desk and safe  Derag Livinghotel Henriette has a 24/7 reception desk, concierge service and guests receive free use of the hotel’s wellness centre, which includes a sauna, steam room and well-equipped gym. Great hotel, central location with an underground stop just outside. A great Edeka mini supermarket 2 minutes walk away, making the kitchenette in the room even more useful. I love having a kettle in the room for that first cup of coffee in the morning. An underground stop one minute away offers a direct link to Potsdamer Platz, ICC Exhibition Centre, Alexanderplatz and the Olympic Stadium. The only advice I have is an extra set of pillows. They even upgraded us to a family suit so my wife and I could have a room to ourselves. 15 minute stroll to Alexanderplatz, U2 undergroud station just outside ( museum something, cant remember ATM... Really helpful staff, would not hesitate in staying again or recommending these hotels. The location is a bit away from sites and dining; however the bus and train are just out the front door. We were given a room in the sister hotel opposite , it was amazing. They also failed to connect a call to my room even though I warned them in advance that someone would call. It had everything we could possibly need and more... beer, water, coffee, tea, trouser press, free spa, free internet. Big, clean rooms and 2 free bottles of Bier a day!! The only thing that would have made it better would have been A/C. This accommodation is also known as Derag Livinghotel, Derag Livinghotel Henriette, Derag Livinghotel Henriette Berlin, and Derag Livinghotel Henriette Hotel. There are a few corner shops and bakeries near by and an Irish bar is only a 10 min walk away. When I was there the Internet wasn’t working so I could not work. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room/bathroom were spacious. It was super easy to use this hotel as our landing pad. Staff were super friendly, the hotel room was great and the two beers and bottles of water every day free was a great little touch.Good location and all in all fantastic stay. The hotel does not have a bar but the sister hotel across the road does (very expensive) so only used it once!. The staff were so friendly and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. In an ideal location all the main sites are an easy walk away, or there is a U-Bahn stop directly opposite. The hotel was perfect, clean, quiet, value for money, great location right outside a tube station. The wifi worked well and had decent speeds which I really needed, the TV has 5 English speaking news channels if you need to be kept informed. The hotel staff were helpful and very pleasant and also speak perfect English. The 4-star Derag Livinghotel Henriette looks over the Spreekanal, just off Berlin’s Spree River, 15 minutes from Alexanderplatz and the Berlin Cathedral on Museum Island. This hotel is a great wee find in a big city and I would go back when next visiting the superb Berlin Berlin card good value saved on many attractions up to 30 . Excellent breakfast served by a very friendly lady who tolerated our tardiness. good hotel, nice staff, nice rooms, clean, close to main attractions, restaurants, everyhting within walking distance On warmer nights food and drink could also be taken on the pleasant outdoor terrace, overlooking the canal. The hotel has an Indian restaurant, Shezan, with a summer patio, while its sister hotel has a bar and more restaurants can be found on the waterfront. I was actually going for low costs as my daughter wanted to pay her share. The Hotel itself is comfortable clean and in a very good location for getting around the city. It is an ideal location for exploring the City's many attractions on foot. And public transport not free 3 days in a row inspectors on underground checking tickets. There was a pleasant, traditional German food and bar area within 5 minutes walk. All in all, excellent value for money and a pleasant, comfortable hotel where staff are really friendly and helpful. Got upgraded to Derag on other side of road and staff and service amazing. The rooms are very comfortable, the complimentary water and beer was a nice touch. The metro u2 line is right outside the hotel and and this takes you to most of all the cities attractions. There is no guest bar or lounge although food and drink could be taken in the adjoining Indian restaurant which was also the Henriette's ownn restaurant. We both were surprised when we realized how nice it was and you were basically walking distance from the inner city. Very clean, modern, great location, wifi didn't work well but that's okay, otherwise everything was great! The hotel desk service staff were amazing, helpful, and cheerful. The room we had was very comfortable and was quiet at night so sleeping was no problem. At first I didn't realize the hotel was at such a central location. The Hotel is a one minutes walk to the nearest underground (Mariches) and about 10 minutes from the overground station - Jannowitzbrücke.
Hotel staff was very friendly and hospitable the suite  was clean and spacious, well equipped and functional. Location easily accessible to Atlanta midtown without the $500.00 per night price and $30 per night valet parking. One of the best memories of our week there was the GIFT WRAP center!!!! He was so friendly and even bought us medicine for an allergic reaction we experienced from face lotion. Also the luggage carts were wonky and need to be replaced. We stayed here for Dragon*Con over Labor Day weekend, and it was a great experience. The hotel places guests near Lenox Square and Legoland Discovery Center. This was an easier way to secure the accommodation, and then collect money from everyone staying in the room. The hotel was cozy, family friendly and comfortable,  Staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Only real issue was noise - east facing rooms are adjacent to heavily traveled road and interstate. Carlos was amazing & is the reason we give a  higher rating! I liked everything about my stay except the issue with climate control in the 1 bedroom suites. Our room was on third floor facing the highway, way too noisy. I enjoyed the modern decor, all areas including my room were clean and well kept. People actually live there though and people smoke marijuana there and it stinks but all and all it was good stay. Since there was a group of six here, I was also able to book book now, pay later on Expedia, and then do a pre-authorized credit card charge with a form provided by the hotel. I booked their smallest suite, despite its size, the layout was very practical and efficient. These special acts of thoughtfulness made a Huge difference in making my overall environment conducive to healing. room really small, mattress in pull out sofa disgusting and had to be changed out immediately, breakfast was cheap and obviously about saving $$, plastic bag over smoke alarm from previous guest, not what I would expect from a Marriott property Plus, there are picnic areas and BBQ grills available for guest use. The price for what we got was excellent, and the entire experience had a very homey feel - from the personalized service to the fresh-baked cookies we were offered one evening while walking in. Wifi was not very good though, so bring your personal hot spot:-). The coffee was always HOT and delicious and breakfast was great! The room was always kept clean as were all the public areas. My only complaint was the mattress was too soft and I ended up with a sore back after my ten day stay. We were given six keycards with no problem... overall, an excellent amazing stay! Nearby dining spots include the Painted Pin and Wet Willie’s. The WiFi was fast though at one point I had issues with connectivity, but phone tech support was able to fix it right away. Took to long for the A/C to cool the bedroom area. The front desk officers should be a bit more flexible with guests. I liked parking in a deck instead of wide out in the open like you do at some places. Suites also offer private bathrooms and air-conditioning as well as full kitchens, flat-screen TVs, and free Internet access. So unless your door is open, you will be hot and uncomfortable. The TownePlace Suites Atlanta Buckhead lies within four miles of Atlanta Botanical Garden and Emory University, six miles from Georgia Aquarium, and is a 35-minute drive from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It is good because the cleaning is good and the room is spacious. Suite configuration  is particularly convenient when traveling with children multiple family members. Had a small gym, Jacuzzi, and access to a pool. We had a suite with two queen beds, a living area, and kitchen area. Suite was equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, small dishwasher, access to free laundry as well. Located off the I-85, the TownePlace Suites Atlanta Buckhead is a three-star extended-stay hotel where amenities available to guests include fitness and business centres and an area shuttle service. Accommodation options include studios and one and two-bedroom suites, each one featuring one or two queen beds. They have quite cleverly installed a super quiet wall fan with a rheostat control in the bedroom. The suite itself was more than adequate, with a mini-kitchen (furnished), work table and nice sitting area. He was kind to our autistic son & connected with him - just went out of his way with us & others to serve and help in any way possible. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute Uber ride from Peachtree Center, and it was extremely convenient, with rides usually costing between $8-$10. The staff were so helpful in providing things that enhanced my recovery from an operation . It was easy to do and gave me peace of mind before arriving. Hotel facilities include a 24-hour front desk, concierge services, coin laundry, and free parking. Also had plenty of charging ports for computers, Kindles, cell phones, etc. on low volume to drown out some of the noise to fall asleep. Was so suprised at how nice and roomy our hotel room was. The kitchenette was very useful for my long term stay. I had the room right by the highway and you could hear it all night. Extra sheets and pillows were delivered, and one morning the front desk attendant even gave us two free drinks we were about to purchase, citing their special policy that allows them to do one favor for a guest. Spent four nights and was quite pleased with the facilities. From the moment we arrived, everyone was super friendly and courteous, and fulfilled every special request we had. They also had a very nice breakfast in the morning. The room was very clean and I slept better than I have for a while on the the bed I had.
If you get there at night the hotel name is not obvious .... Look for the one that says Hotel!!!. Our room was located to the back of the building and not on a Main Street. Rate did include breakfast, which was basic but adequate if for no other reason than coffee was available. I was not concerned about amenities and just needed a safe secure place for an overnight short stay. The hotel lobby looks small, but there is another sitting area on floor 1. This hotel is literally right across the street from the main train station north side. Perfect location, super clean, beds too soft, mini fridge broken Compared to its next door neighbor, this hotel was a huge disappointment. Some of the hotel staff were really friendly--others not as friendly. My guess is that there was a broken bidet in our room and some smells were coming up through the plug area. Right in front of the main train station in Hamburg, so location is key. Enjoy a buffet breakfast and views of the Kunsthalle Art gallery from the hotel’s breakfast room. There are two traditional German restaurants within a few steps of the hotel’s entrance. Great location for everything and for a 3* hotel it lived up well to expectations. There is a escalator  to the U2 and U4 down the street, so if using either of those lines then one doesn't even need to walk across the street. Room size and layout was clean, but cramped; bedding and linens were institutional at best. All are non-smoking and come with flat-screen TV, sitting area, safe and large en suite bathrooms with shower. No one was rude and that might have to do with their command of the English language. Hamburg City Hall, the Schauspielhaus, Binnenalster Lake and the Old Town are all within a mile. No hotpot, iron, laundry services, or any convenience that a business traveler would need. Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice, staff were all fantastic, very helpful and friendly. Cramped shower w/awkward faucet made showering more like a yoga challenge. Guests can book discounted treatments at a spa located at a nearby partner hotel. The only complaint I had was that it did not smell very good in the bathroom. Staff showed a minimal amount of courtesy once my card was charged for the full amount of my stay. Great location, right outside the central train station, my room was spot on, a little dated, but no problems. Located in a 19th-century historic building opposite Hamburg's main train station, Novum Hotel Kronprinz Hamburg boasts individually-styled rooms with free high-speed internet, cable TV and a tasty buffet breakfast.
The shampoo was the same *The bathroom floor was covered in hair  *One of the bed's sheets were stained *Thin uncomfortable pillows *The battery cover on remote was missing *Window leaked and there was standing water and mold on the window sill *The bath faucet knob was full of mold *We asked for the bath to be cleaned. Set in a red brick building, GuestHouse Inn & Suites Nashville Music Valley is set in Music Valley Drive and less than two miles from the famous Grand Ole Opry. There is also an outlet mall next to the Opry for some shopping. The casual rooms include a microwave, cable TV and free Wi-Fi service. Room was fine, but the hallway on the third floor smelled like mold. (Have seen worse and better)Location was nice as we were close to everything we wanted to see during our short stay. This hotel isn't much of a beauty to look at, but a perfect place for a Nashville stay. This hotel was right across the road from the Grand Ole Opry and Opry Mills mall. Only one shuttle was available that seated only 5 passengers besides the driver. It is convenient to the Grand Ole Opry, though, and a shuttle stop to go to downtown Nashville. They did have hard boiled eggs...but I don’t eat those....probably for the majority of people out there the breakfast will work out well. When directions were needed they were provided with a smile. Near Opryland convention center and a few nice restaurants and bars. We slowly got checked in, and then the long list of what was wrong started:  *The hallway was dimly lit, all walls and doors had major paint scratches *The hallway ceilings were very low, the sprinklers barely above my husband's head *Sprinkler in the room had paint on it *The toiletries were used, the mouthwash was opened and half used. The beds weren't comfortable but for location to mall and Grande Ole Opryland it was good. Room okay, hotel close to the Opry and the cost okay for those of us on a budget. I would stick to a chain that has more standardized accommodations. With that said it was an ok place to stay for two nights. The walls are paper thin, the person next door kept his TV on all night and I could not get any sleep. wanted a nice hotel was very disappointed room had a bad smell everything was dusty not happy at all Hotel staff never offered an apology, and they even asked us to change our own sheets. And the pool has been in disrepair and unusable for months. every thing needed was close by or available at the INN. The most famous music landmarks such as the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, are about six miles away. Late on Saturday night we came in to the hotel with take out and forgot silverware. It just seemed like an old hotel without an equipment upgrade budget. I reiterated it one more time and they said call the front desk if there is a problem. Our room had vinyl flooring, but had not been swept/ cleaned. Everything just seemed dated like it hadn't been touched in twenty years. The maid came and mopped the center of the bathroom and still did not clean up any of the hair on the floor *The refrigerator was missing all of the shelves and the door shelves, so the drinks we bought had to be placed in the bottom of the refrigerator *The indoor pool was closed and looked like it had been for a very long time *Work out room had few horribly working equipment (junk) *There were a few signs up about renovations, but there was no sign of any work  We had to stay the night because all other hotels were booked for the night and we had no choice. The front desk personnel were very nice, polite and helpful (especially Justin). We were able to walk to the Grand Ole Opry and have a great time there. After two nights we left feeling as as if we had mild pneumonia. They're currently under going renovation, that is making the rooms even more pleasant. When the person would clear the phlegm out of their throat and huck a loogie it sounded like they were in my room...it was gross. Breakfast was skimpy, pastry/bread box was out of almost everything....had to go out to eat breakfast after eating breakfast in motel. After some of the hotels I have been in this is a vast improvement. We spoke to others staying there the next morning at the not great breakfast, and they all had the same experience. We had stayed at this hotel last year and it did not have this odor. We had a room on the third floor and the whole floor had an odor to it when you walked off the elevator. Older hotel,swimming pool area was in pretty bad shape ,smelt like mold in our room. Bathrooms had mildew on the walls between the tiles - just a very tired hotel. The hotel was clean and everything in the restroom seemed to work correctly. Also, even though our room was a non-smoking room, it smelled of cigarette smoke. Our 2nd floor ice machine was broken so had to go to 3rd floor to get some. Other services include guest coin-operated laundry services and a hot tub. The shower was horable, it was a small stream of water with little pressure. They picked based on ratings and all were furious with the obviously not true ratings posted. The front desk staff was kind enough to find silverware for us. There's an indoor swimming pool that opens starting in May. Love the view out the window, and the mural on the wall in our room. Upon arriving to the hotel we noticed that the pool was empty. Hotel was okay, people at the front desk friendly except for the big guy with a goatee, kind of superior type, not a good communicator. Wife went to the front counter to get new sheets and it took them for ever to find clean ones so obviously they don’t clean their sheets to often Room was dirty food in the floor beside the bed. The next night came and the TV was turned down but SINCE IT SOUNDS like it is in my room I still had the noise problem. We were a little concerned about our long standing booking after reading recent reviews, but we were very pleasantly surprised to find our room to be spacious, clean, quiet & nice to relax in. Guests can enjoy a complimentary continental breakfast in the morning. The breakfast was good..lots of carbs ....it all looked great....But I’m going low carbs...so most was off limits lol. There was a great restaurant just across the street . Going through a remodel but the smell in hallways was awful. We understood that renovation happen, but I feel the the proper thing to do is to make a note of it on this site or at least the hotel page. The location to the Grand Ole Opry is excellent and the entire staff very friendly. Everyone was nice and the room was great in joyed  our stay . We were using this as a stop to sleep on a longer road trip. The second room we were transferred to smelled like moth balls. I’m sure after a while it won’t be as noticeable. Stayed last year during renovation and were hoping would be done and better this year. Almost every inch on carpeting in the hotel was stained and filthy. One hotel employee was not pleasant at all when shuttling us back and forth. House keeping came by at 8am and woke us up multiple times. Amazing staff and the place was like home we'll be staying there again. I told the front desk about the noise passing through the walls  and asked them to have the person turn off their TV after 2 AM in the morning and they said they would tell the person to turn it down. If it is just my room (which I doubt) then they should tear the walls apart and put insulation in the walls. Shuttle bus service is nice but small, we need to wait for the 3rd round and late for the conference. There were many of us that needed to get to the convention center at the same time. The hotel offers guests a complimentary shuttle to the airport and in-room mini fridges. Could slightly smell it when checked in, but our stay on the 2nd floor was literally gagging. A couple of great bonus features were, daily breakfast and a prompt, courteous complimentary airport pickup & drop off as well as a shuttle service to nearby Opryland. We has booked for 5 nights, but only stayed 1. Staff was very friendly and the rooms were quiet enough. Would not have stayed if I could have gotten a refund. Not the nicest place in the area, but can't beat the location and the cost. The carpet needed to be cleaned and I found popcorn by my bed when we arrived. Nice hotel just wish they would've told us before we checked in the pools weren't able to be used. Good deal for a hotel this close to Opryland Convention Center; especially since it has good wi-fi, decent continental breakfast, and a free shuttle to and from the convention center. The Grayline has a hop on hop off tour and each morning provides a shuttle to downtown (if you buy a tour) and back again in the afternoon. We could here a maid arguing with someone on her sale phone and it was a very loud argument with lots of colorful language. I said you don't understand the walls are paper thin (sound wise) and that wont help and they said they would tell them to turn it down. Carpets in hallway on fourth floor at least, seriously needed vacumning. We try to stay at this hotel every time we're in Nashville. There was a very odd smell when you entered the lobby, as if an unpleasant odor was being masked by some type of canned air freshener. When we got into our room we noticed the floor had not been swept and had to get the maid to come in and sweep and wash the floor. Pool area was dumpy, needs some paint on the woodwork and new carpet. desk clerk helpful ,ordering shuttle and overall.garbage bin out front of hotel was over filled and falling on ground everyday we were there. GuestHouse Inn & Suites Nashville Music Valley is two miles form Opry Mills shopping centre and five miles from Andrew Jackson's Hermitage. The staff was very nice and helpful but there's only so much they can do. Seemed to be short on staff which is why the room floors and bath could have been cleaner. Good special staff very cooperative and the good thing is , it has free ride to Airport and Gaylord Opryland conversation Center We got a new room and as we were getting settled in a cockroach ran across the floor. The actual room was so musty and humid that the carpet was always damp, the air was thick , and it was necessary to run the AC (which rattled noisily) on high the entire time just to make the atmosphere breathable. Hotel definitely is in need of updates, which it appears that they're planning to do. Great location right off Briley Parkway and 5 minutes from the Opry Theater. It was not anything fancy but it was great for what we needed. Sons room did not have clean sheets and he had to get clean ones from desk and change them himself. 5 minute drive from the Grand Ole Opry, Cooters place, and Gaylord Opry hotel. Guests can also enjoy the fitness room and meeting facilities. Once in our room we found used soap bottles and wrappers in the shower. The restaurant has great music and good food , the hotel recommend the restaurant They are redoing the hotel and it seems like a long work in progress. Everytime we would move they would make a banging noise or squeeking noise. Our room was non-smoking but it had been smoked in and tried to cover it up with strong cinnamon smell. I would only recommend this hotel after a good, thorough cleaning. The room we originally booked into smelled musty and there was water in the fridge, wet carpet surrounding the fridge. However, the rooms are somewhat shabby and not as clean appearing as I would prefer; some stains on carpet and upholstered furniture, for example. They refunded our money, and we went to another hotel. Love the guest staff they were great but the whole atmosphere at the hotel was poor. The room service did not place enough soap, shampoo, shower cap, lotion for 4 of us. My boyfriend and I stayed at the GuestHouse Inn and Suites. The person in the room next door was not the problem, it is the thin walls. The only complaint I would have is that the bathroom is so small!! There was trash on our floor when we got into the room. Once we opened our door and took the key out the door automatically locked and wouldn't shut so we had to lock it but re-inserting the key and lock it that way. Though the room was spacious & Rudy, everything was very wirn, outdated & had an idir. Place only 'alright' due to horrendous smell of used kitty litter (strong ammonia odor) on first 2 floors. The couch in our room was dirty and the floor was super dirty as well. Pictures look nice so I snagged it up, the mattress looked like there was a murder scene on it! I have to say for the price we paid I was content. Nice clean rooms but paper thin walls, heard our neighbors talking conversation till 1 am. Loved the music mural on the wall in our room though, that was cool. The staff was really friendly and the room was clean. There were a few times we could here people in the next rooms...but no different than other hotels. We didn't have a do not disturb sign so we couldn't hang it on the door. Gave us a key to someone's room and all they could say was oopsie. Make sure to get a newly renovated room if possible. Right next to the hotel is a strip small with a Grayline bus terminal. With that it was extremely noticeable that there was no odor and that the carpets were in much cleaner condition. Nope...main reason for choosing this hotel was for the kids to use the pool and at the time of booking (through expedia) it wasnt noted on the site that pool was closed...beds were ok pillows were thinner than a newspaper...whole hotel has an odd odor (maybe from remodeling) air conditioner made weird noise the entire night....the newly painted room looked horrible.....overall if you need a budget friendly place to stay its meh....but don't expect much.... We did notice an odd smell each time we walked in. But they did make it a good experience for us. The hotel was conveniently located to the convention center that we needed to attend. Decent place for the price, but the beds were not comfortable and I'm the rooms (especially bathroom) could be a bit cleaner. The bathroom tiles were moldy, and the toilet seat was broken. Our son has dr visits annually at Vanderbilt children’s hospital. All pillows and blankets were still dirty had hairs and smelt like sweat! I put a towel in the door crack space and put tissue in my ears, this did not help. I was really leery of keeping this booking after reading other reviews. Our  Room off the lobby was a little noisy but not bad.
I booked this hotel with the intent of using the pool. We checked out early the next morning and stayed in another motel for the duration of our trip. Room was super hot, I don't know why the AC out of nowhere during night it turns off.. the clientel running around the casino caught me off guard. 1st they were giving me a hard time checking in so I didn’t get the room I paid for  2nd every night I was there we never been asked to show our key card! This hotel was on the strip and close to the other hotels. The Buffet was expensive as are most now in Las Vegas. Had to walk to the Paris hotel to sit by a pool in January/February. I am more upset with Travelocity for promoting a $25 pool credit at a hotel where the pool was not even open!!! We had a good over all experience (as usual) except for Mr Marshall ! Just a shower with no curtain or door and floor very slippery as water sprays out. The view was great, the beds were very comfortable, the room was spotless and there were refillable shampoo, conditioner and body wash pumps in the shower (yay for the environment). Luckily, Harrahs was nice enough to turn it into a food and beverage credit. When I turned off the internet and used data I could see the map. However we paid the $30 dollars a night so not to contribute to loses of jobs. Too bad we had to pay for the extra night given that we really didn't get to use it. they charged extra frees if you want to have your room clean everyday and with new towels.. It wasn't really bad but not up to my standards. Smell bad.Misleading information.Wifi just for 2 people  You have to pay $14.95 per day if you use more than 2 devices Not recommendation.Not  happy at all Water pressure was terrible, the shower and the bath ran at the same time. Was told I COULD use it for food or drinks. I think the hotel works on a first come basis instead of honoring reservations. Elevators were the quickest of any hotel I ever was in. It was a bit on the dark side, and seemed a bit out dated. Shopping malls close by (fashion show mall), Caesars palace and another back towards MGM. Minus the very fruity air freshener that was circulating throughout the entire building, I would highly recommend Harrah’s. When I used the internet (at $23/day on the resort package) it messed up my phone and I got NO service. The hotel location is perfect right in the center of the strip the carnival bar is awesome not recommended for families only adults had    Lots of fun Loved the ease of getting to our room and getting food. no excuse for  allowing inappropriate clothed, yelling, drink spilling, obnoxious people to make it annoying to others. Concierge was asked to make reservation for 40th bday party with cake for nice steak house at freemont experience and failed miserably. Location is the only thing Harrahs has going for it. I upgraded the room to a 2 bedroom suite and the suite was nice. The hotel was right in the middle of the strip which was very convenient for us since we were able to walk everywhere. I decided to check in with the machine and I ended up with a shitty dirty room with no storage and the bed comforter is filthy dirty. the last day we were harassed by a security guard to show our hotel pass when I already gave him My suite # we were in and still wouldn’t let us get in the Elevator Beside that enjoyed my time in Vegas Not a bad hotel, but I believe it is overpriced. It was just oh well as Taylor shut down and no longer spoke to us. This can’t help but put a damper on an otherwise good trip. Casino is not as big/fancy as some of the others - but rooms are great. Check in is ridiously slow as well as the internet service in our room. Once I arrived I was pushed off to a single bed room and treated rudely by Taylor at the front desk. Meals were high and the wait at the machines for drinks were slow. Harrah's Las Vegas is an affordable, welcoming resort where guests can break away from their daily routine in a playful atmosphere. Spa closed too early to use in the evening and buffet was pricey and no frills with no melted butter for seafood and no spinach salad. Everything was great except we did not get our scheduled wakeup call. The concierge was extremely helpful when the lobby kiosk said our room was not ready 4 hours after check in started. The cleaners of the rooms for so kind and helpful This is a great program that I use whenever I travel. Opted out of the daily house keeping for $10/day credit. The shower didn’t have a shower curtain but maybe that’s the new thing. I will remember this in the future when considering to use Travelocity again. The newly remodeled part of the hotel is very nice! The Piano Bar delivers non-stop fun with dueling pianos, live entertainment from Big Elvis and karaoke. Resort fee was outrageous and wasn’t included in booking until we arrived. So by the time you pay the resort fee and the parking fee you need to add another $40 to your room charge per night. couple lights were out and one of the toilets was hard to flush Worst hotel in Vegas.. We arrived at 9pm and the room wasn't clean up/ready.. even though check in is at 4pm. The casino was the smokiest of all the others on the strip. I don't think I will stay at this hotel again. The pillows feel like bricks and you can hear everything from the other rooms I asked for a receipt and he said I didn't get one until I checked out. Handy location mid strip and very easy self parking option. It was just bad to wait in so many long lines. The free breakfast a $9 credit for Starbucks is pretty much useless as it doesn't even buy you a large coffee and muffin or bread loaf. However, someone still came into my room, went through my things and stole a case and some smaller items. I had to wait an extra hour to get my room ready. The room was clean and the staff was very helpful. Also Harrah's concierge is an outside vendor and all they did was tell me they'd send me a $25 gift card to resruraunt.com which I never got. Harrah's now has automatic machines that you can check in with. It doesn't have the wow factor like other hotels/resorts, but the room was updated, everything was easy to get to, great location on the strip! I was disappointed to find out that we owed a substantial fee for our room in addition to the charges we had already paid prior to our arrival. Can stay at a hotel for the same price on the strip with much better quality. They were very clean, and the cleaning people were very friendly. However the issue was resolved a few days after we had left not that anyone contacted me! Although it was on the cheaper side, we paid for an upgraded room in the new part of the hotel and still only got plastic cups. Overall clean room at a reasonable price but would have stayed a little further away for renovated rooms in hindsight. The wait at check in and check out was terrible. My AC would not cool the room down below 69 degrees. This year we were given two adjoining rooms in C tower. We were seated and then after a bit, we were told we would have to go get our own drinks. But a big plus was the Ben and Jerry Ice Cream store on the second floor. I would pay a little more and stay elsewhere if I was to find myself back in Vegas. Staff were very efficient and the hotel it's self is a great place to eat drink and be entertained . Flair bartenders wow guests in the outdoor Carnaval Court bar. We were supposed to have been able to check in at 3:00pm, but was not able to check in until midnight due to them giving our hotel room away, even though we had a prepaid reservation and a confirmation, the day prior, that the room would be ready. Even though they have self check-in / check-out Kiosk's they directed me at both occasions to the front desk where I waited for over 30 minutes both times. My first time visiting Las Vegas, I chose this hotel because of comfort, friendly staff and service. We opt to pay rather than take a $20 dollar reduction to the bill. When we arrived on Friday evening, the check in line had about 75 people in it. I looked forward to my stay but once i arrived it was downhill. These rooms were gorgeous, and very updated, although the views were facing the parking lot. Sorry to say I will not be staying there again. It was pretty clean but I found some dirt on the tables. There was no dresser to store our clothes in just a closet for hang up items so I had to keep my clothes in my suit case. I have received print out of any charges etc when requested. very clean  and a good location everything you need in one location Just wish the people that checked you in were a little more friendlier . Extreme convoluted check in procedure to get two rooms  Tired unfriendly staff  Minimum amenities in room. Small pool with both sides of prime sun space reserved for diamond members only which were ALL vacant but no one could use them. The other couple received vouchers for food and other stuff for staying there for the firat time and we did not. The rooms need work, and even my Uber driver said they need to tear it down Love the location and the style of the room but was so disappointed to find out that I did not have a choice on using the Gym and was still had to pay for it and they would not give in. Our booking was for march 16th -19th but our flight didn't get in until late and didn't get to the hotel until early on the 17th. The staff will make sure that your stay is perfect. It was an amazing experience, I'll would totally recommend this hotel to friends and family. Internet in my room on the 9th floor was spotty on my phone but my tablet picked it up ok. My license would not work for me to self check so when I went to the counter she was going to charge me 30.00 instead of the 10.00 fee for checking in early. We like the location of Harrah's, but thought we could have done a bit better with the price of the rooms. Room was very comfortable for the short amount of time we spent in there. They didn't pick up the trash one day Food at the food court is awful, their taco salad got me sick and their customer service is just terrible, they don't care about the customers at all. First of all, I booked 2 queen beds which I paid for and was charged extra for as it is more than just a king. Next visit of course it would be at the Harrah's. It was great but my suggestion is they need more check in people long lines for check in and check out (which we almost missed our flight) only 1-2 people for a long line was a bit frustrating My fiance and I stayed a night at Harrahs in Las Vegas and absolutely loved it. Clean hotel, pool was good as was the health club. We were not even directed on where to locate our room. The casino has to be the noisiest of all the casino's. Very disappointed we had to pay extra to have the room cleaned. A few of us meet in Vegas every year for a small reunion. To make up for this, they upgraded us to another room and took one day of resort fees away from our overall bill, but this did not make up fully for the extremely late check in time. Room was nice very large for 2 ppl nice tub, no shower door was odd. The room was old and out dated and I was stunned. What is a $35 a day resort fee anyway which what I was charged on top of the hotel cost. After our arrival, we put our bags in our room and then went to have dinner at the buffet on the casino floor. Very convenient location, nice staffers and very attentive house keepers. She sent us to the Freemont hotel with a reservation for a steakhouse in freemont California! They upgraded us to their new renovated wing and it was beautiful. We had never stayed at Harrah's - only eaten the buffet before. The center-Strip hotel offers more than 2,500 hotel rooms and suites. did not enjoy seeing young kids in strollers as well as early teens, not being supervised by PARENTS???? There are no maps of the strip, good thing I have my phone. Granted, the cost difference is not huge but we are talking principle. We were treated as though we were paying for a $400/night hotel. Marshall said I didn't have a choice and he had my credit card and already applied the charge. Very nice room renovation but needs to reconsider where electrical outlets are placed in the room We were not difficult or hostile but had no offer of apology or understanding for the inconvenience. They pointed in the direction to get drinks which was about 40 yards away. I don't know what they have a resort fee of 40$ daily if you're already paying for nightly rental. There were lots of video poker games to choose from. We booked because Orbitz had a great deal for a one night booking and were so impressed. I get that not all casinos have pools open year round but it would have been nice to know that at check in. There was only a small bar of soap in the bathroom to use. Stayed in a Valley Room and thought they were very nice. They should have said you HAVE to use it for food or drinks. I would have booked a different hotel, had this information been given while searching. So the low price for the room is not so low after all. easy to get around in the area, rt in the middle of the strip. I liked my room and the hotel staff that I dealt with were good. This hotel was the cheapest of the hotels on the strip, but I guess you get what you pay for, so can't complain too much. i have stayed here b4 and it seems to be going in the wrong direction. We learned that the front door had fallen on another customer and they had trouble finding a replacement door. Coffee pot not provided and extra mirror for women to put make up on. We were surprised when we checked in, to be given a credit for Starbucks coffee, good for the three days we were at the hote. I was double charged for the  Menopause musical once by the box office and then on my Harrahs final invoice. Rooms might be cheap but they charge you for everything else you can possibly think of. I dont feel they should charge to get your room cleaned and if your staying at the hotel you should get more discounts for food Once we wandered around and asked a guard at the first tower we reached for directions we found it. Have stayed at Harrah's previous and ne hesitation in staying again. Not as showy as others but very good value for money Was very disappointed that there was no refrigerator in room. Comfortable beds, smells very clean and lots of good food right at the hotel. Would recommend to a friend and also come back again myself . Very good hotel on the strip near to all interest places in Las Vegas strip There are six shows on property including Tenors of Rock, The Righteous Brothers: Bill Medley & Bucky Heard and longtime Vegas magician Mac King. My brother who got a room as well, paid 25 more, but received an extremely good hotel room. The resort fee of $39 a day for free local calls, use of the fitness center and free wifi is a sham!!! My girlfriend became ill during dinner and tried to make her way out of the buffet and to a restroom, but was grabbed by a man while in route. So we were not provided the accomodations I paid for, I am treated rudely by the desk staff and left to aimlessly try to find my room and I am relegated to the worst of the hotel. After receiving my credit card to pay resort fee he informs me he is also going to charge a 150.00 fee for possible room service during my stay. Easy to get in and out of by foot or by car. I like to stay at a different hotel every time I go to see what they are like. Harrah's Las Vegas features 87,000 square feet of casino space with a redesigned race and sports book. On the plus side the staff were lovely and helpful! Restaurants encompass everything from country star Toby Keith's casual I Love This Bar & Grill to Ruth's Chris Steak House, a romantic, upscale venue with breathtaking views of the Strip. Needless to say we had to scrounge for food for 6 at the last minute and tony Romas was not birthday dinner quality but the food was cheap and the service sucked! We stayed at Harrah's last year and was a bit disappointed with the rooms. I signed up for the no service for the duration of my stay. Next trip to Vegas, we will find a different hotel. So they gave me $40.00 off my bill and I had NO maid service the whole 7 days there. Stood in the mardi grass room and it was very outdated, hallways smells like weed, really cold hallway, small pool, not every restaurant was open. They also had auto check in machines which made check in and out effortless and quick (no lines) - Next time we stay in Vegas in June we will be back! Great location, right in the sweet spot of the strip. No free standing fan available and if you want a mini fridge you need to pay 15.00 per night. Yet, instead, Travelocity lures you with a pool credit for a pool that you can’t use. This makes it appear to be less expensive compared to other hotels when searching, but it is not. Great service, friendliness, quick response to room door not locking. I have stayed many times at Total Rewards hotels and never had  any difficulties with the hotel or clerks until now. We went as a group of two couples with separate reservations. The newly renovated rooms in the Valley tower are very nice.
The only issue we had was that during our 2 night stay, our room door key rarely worked which was a bit of a hassle, which was a problem shared by one of our neighbors as well other than that we enjoyed our stay, the best feature is being right on the beach. Every room has a beach facing balcony which is a great feature. Room was clean, staff was nice, and location was great. Very fun place to vacation just wish the weather would have cooperated. For some reason though they had issues with the toilet handles breaking or it just not being the easiest to flush. Breakfast is not diabetic friendly but our room had a full sized fridge/freezer, stove, toaster and microwave with cookware available. A quick walk past the pool and you’re on the beautiful beach. It is right on the beach and has a heated pool and a hot tub. The pool is a decent size for a little fun with the family. Layout of the rooms is excellent and rooms are large and comfortable. We decided to just tough it out the last day as we didn’t want to repack our belongings back up just to unpack somewhere else. Housekeeping never cleaned our room until the day before we left! Even asked which floor I would prefer, since there was several rooms available. The area was good but the room was not fully clean, we found a pair of underwear by the bed. The hotel was great overall, the suite was spacious and the kitchenette had all the pans and dishes needed to make meals. The spare blanket in the  dresser need washed and probably kept in plastic to prevent it from being smelly. The room was nice, the staff very friendly and personal, and the amenities are perfect! great place to stay close to shopping and close to pier park where we spent 90% of our time in the car show The pool is heated and the hot tub was just right. The staff was very friendly and the room was a good value. The complementary Breakfast and coffee was terrible Beach and Cabana man we're excellent! It was ok. Room was a bit dated and the grounds could do with a modern upgrade. Was exactly what I was looking for in my mini vacation The view is  gorgeous if you stay 4th and above. Do yourself a favor and stay a few blocks off the strip where it's more quiet. All of the reviews for this place said it was older but great so I booked it thinking that it was a steal. The carpet felt gross, the paint was coming off the ceiling in the bathroom, and the AC worked just enough to leave the entire room feeling muggy but livable. All in all very happy with the our choice of choosing Beachcomber by the sea. The only issue we had was that our ac unit cover fell off the unit and the filter was pretty filthy. The suite is well layed out in terms of usable space. Unacceptable: this is not mentioned anywhere upon booking, nor on the hotel's website. Maids did not clean room on one day after request in Twice. The complimentry  breakfast was below par, dont expect a buffet. Overall for a short stay it would be ok, but for a week or so, I would prefer something more modern. Will definitely be my choice whenever I go to PCB! They could provide a small broom and dustpan so that we could sweep up sand that gets tracked in. This hotel was perfect for me during my stay for the Seabreeze Jazz Festival. My husband actually had a bite mark on his leg when he woke up. Although we aren't going to do any cooking while we are there, it is so nice to have a full refrigerator to keep our leftovers and a microwave to warm them up. The street noise was unbearable the first night so we had to sleep with the AC fan on all night which froze us because the bed only had a sheet and a thin blanket on it. Full kitchen with cookware, standard bathroom, spacious layout for up to 6 guests. When i entered the lobby had a funky smell and if my payment was not already made,i would have tried to book somewhere else. Upper room was quiet despite being directly on a busy street. Got here early and got a room with no problem. We got there and I was immediately uneasy when we pulled up to the front. Even the few repairs that had been done were only half way finished. I think a pack of Band-Aids would be good to have available. Apartments include a separate living area from the bedroom, fully equipped kitchens, private bathrooms with shower/tub combination and hair dryer, air conditioning, flat-screen TVs in all rooms, air conditioning, a pullout sofa and a balcony. The chairs on the balony were two old chairs and they did not even have a table. Like the room is perfect for families love the view and the heated pool Mr. Esmond, the bartender at the onsite Tiki bar is amazing and made our stay even more enjoyable! The bathroom had dirt and grime in the corners of the room and around the door stop. The pool, hot tub and tiki bar were clean and beautiful. Toilet seat and bathroom door were broken Traffic noise from Beach Front Drive. We have stayed at The Beachcomber many times but not in the past 2 years. A very short drive to the Russels Pier and Pier Park for shopping and restaurants. What a pleasant surprise - it had been updated and is much nicer! The chairs and table on the balcony  need to be replaced.The bed was very comfortable which is a big plus. You could tell that they definitely only gave it a quick once over. The room was nice - a little dated but clean. The room was spacious and clean, every room has a beachfront view and it is also in walking distance to all the  nice restaurants and shopping. All of the rooms have a beachfront view, our room was nice and clean when we arrived, the kitchen arrive was a nice addition. My only complaint is that the WiFi only works near the lobby. The pool area was nice with comfortable chairs with cushions and umbrellas. And be sure to visit Winn Dixie across the street for and other things you forgot and they’ll even blow up beach inflatables! It took me an hour and a half to check in. The room had a nice double full bed, into kitchenette and then to the large living area with sofa bed, this was the beach front end of the room. When I called though, they came immediately to fix it. My daughter fell by the pool on concrete and of course started bleeding. Cleaning staff could use some improvement with timeliness, but overall it was a great stay! I just ended up going to buy my own box at a nearby CVS. I stayed there about 20 years ago so this was my second and just like the first time very impressed. Beautiful I must say I loved the view and the staff was awesome Hotel is okay and it’s very close to the beach a lot to do around the area The white sand beach and many water sports activities are right outside. Not filthy but need a good deep cleaning like the walls doors  cabinets and headboards. They don't have nearly enough spaces onsite for even half the rooms. When you pay for a vacation you want something nicer then where you live but this needed so many repairs. The only disappointment was there are not washer/dryers in the rooms. Very happy with location and very warm pool and hot tub, nice beach,  needs a little update on the room fixtures and beds, furniture etc,  but would love to stay again very good value. People in next room smoked Mary Jane everyday and made our kids sick. Was greeted by Andrea and was able to check-in early! The staff were awesome and all the rooms have an awesome beach front view from your private balcony. The type of suite was a pleasant surprise, as I didn’t know I would have an oven, stove and refrigerator in the room. Our only complaint is that the pool isn’t heated as it stated on website and our keycard NEVER worked correctly. Also, the ceiling outside the bathroom was wet, along with the carpet alongside the bathroom wall. They explained that they were short on help and it was Easter Sunday after all. Two tvs and wifi, which wasn't the greatest, but only used it in the evenings anyway. excellent time , accommodations were great , its not a 5 star hotel , but for the price , I was very satisfied . All in all, a perfect place for us to enjoy paradise! I had a King Suite and it was really comfortable and private. The bed was comfy, clean linens and perfect little kitchen with untesils and pot and pan to cook breakfast. Beachcomber By the Sea provides 24-hour front desk service, laundry facilities, beach access with loungers and umbrellas, beachview heated outdoor pool and whirlpool and a computer lounge. There are many restaurants, cafes and bars within a five minute walk. Location is better than any other we considered- only a short mile  away from the congested crowds of the main strip but close (1/2 block) to everything you need like Winn Dixie, CVS, fast food and sit down restaurants. Everything was great have a good experience there would recommend There was a drip in the ceiling in our bathroom and we were told that there was no one in the room above us. We were told that we had the option to get a new room, but that that location was booked and we would have to drive more than a mile up the road to a sister location. The Barefoot Hideaway Grill is located next to the hotel and is one of the last beachfront restaurants, offering seafood, burgers, sandwiches and drinks. The location was great and was within walking distance to restaurants.The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean but the carpet needed to be cleaned. All in all, it is a good value for the price. I just expected a room to be ready since I had one reserved. The hotel is located right on the beach which a plus. The hotel is located only a short drive from the Pier and all of the shops/restaurants by the Pier, which was nice. We ended up getting 3 blankets from the front desk and we laid them on top of the bed and slept on them to avoid being bitten again. We got up to the room and upon walking in I thought ok maybe it's not so bad but then I started looking around and you could clearly tell that the place needed some serious renovations. The check in and out was very easy due to great staff who were knowledgeable and friendly. Room was larger than expected; kitchenette was a surprise bonus. I would recommend to a friend and would use them again. Our room had a kitchenette and there was plenty of space. The front desk staff was amazing 10 out of 10. I have stayed at a few By the Sea resorts and the wifi has been an issue at atleast two of them. I'm about 95% positive the bed had bedbugs because I felt like I was being bitten by something all night. Gulf World Marine Park is less than two miles away. Beachcomber By the Sea is a beachfront resort offering vacation apartments near Frank Brown Park. The connection was so poor that I could not use the internet at all from my room. Unit was clean and well maintained but could use an update. The bedroom area is adequate, the bathroom area is adequate, and the din/living room is adequate. Other than that, it was an okay place to stay. My only other complaint is they don't seem to have any first aid kit. The grounds are gorgeous and every suite has an ocean front balcony. But right on the beach and the beds were comfy. The rooms layout, free quick breakfast, and pool area are perfect for his small children. Bedrooms are too small with Beds that were too soft and lumpy. They even have a poolside type of bar and grill. I asked the front desk for a band-aid and you would've thought I was asking for the impossible. We had made reservations for 4th of July as well but I cancelled because of the condition of the hotel. Lots of maintenance issues with cheap old fixtures and appliances .... even silverware was bad. You'll end up paying a lot less money and get a cleaner room in the end.
The room was clean & had a nice layout with separate sitting/ kitchenette area, balcony looked out toward city skyline. There is a railroad track which interrupted sleep, but was able to sleep otherwise. Was very unhappy that I paid extra for this “perk.” I did speak with the front desk about my disappointment and they let us eat breakfast (which I thought was included) for free. the room was very comfortable, it was 5 of us traveling husband and I and 3 teenage boys. The elevator smells, the carpet is shabby, the paint on the walls are cracked and peeling and there were ants in our room. Called front desk again and they noted someone did go but couldn't fix it. My wife told the manager Julie about the moldy robes, broken shower fixtures, no shower caps (my wife hair was really wet once we left), no more sponges and the bugs still on the balcony door but she seemed not to take it as serious if it was another guest of a certain race. Everyone was very pleasant and willing to make our stay a wonderful experience. A stopover before a cruise-what else can I add ? In my opinion they could all be part of the Ritz. The carpet could use a good cleaning and the water pressure in the shower could certainly use an upgrade. The lobby was the only appealing part of the hotel, but once you hit the elevator button to go to your room, that's where all the appeal comes to an abrupt stop. I stayed on the sixth floor and it had a garbage smell. We were apparently spoiled by Drury Hotels bc this was not at all what we were expecting. Yes, the hotel shows some wear but received a good deal for the price. It is a very nice place and the staff are very nice and helpful rooms have to be updated, new carpeting larger coffee makers. It is a 12.5 mile journey to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. This is an old Embassy Suites that should have been re-conditioned but was just turned over to  Sheraton. The hotel is nice but a long way from the tourist spots. Asked to moved but said they had no other rooms. This is a suites hotel, and the rooms are large and divided, the bed and pillows are exceptionally comfortable, and the staff is always there to please. A lot of noise around: train, highway,  the air conditioning system. everyone was very cordial except for one check clerk, she was rude and seemed to be bothered that we were asking questions. Despite the hotel being near empty they put the guests that they had closest to the train tracks. Sade, Yosmin, and Arthur we amazing (especially Arthur, he needs 10 thumbs up for his superb customer service!!). Arthur apologized for our terrible experience and his sincere concern was greatly appreciated. It was late when I arrived and there was only 1 desk person and there were numerous people in line waiting to check in. the room was right off of a train that went through at least 2 times during the night and we were not told about this, e.g. Hotel was clean and room was large - good value. They also provide guests with all the water and soft drinks they want. Outdated but from the looks of it that seemed to be the norm for Fort Lauderdale. Someone came to check bathroom when we were gone but it still didn't work. We were comfortable and happy with the stay, we decided to stay an extra day. Room is separated from the living room area which is great for those with children especially since there is a tv in both rooms. very nice hotel, rooms are also nice, very clean condition, staff very friendly specially Julie at the front desk, she was awesome!!! Hotel was quiet, relaxing & staff was very helpful & courteous. we booked this hotel because it had a door separating the bedroom from living room, but the door made noise every time the person sleeping in the living room needed to use the bathroom. My husband is ready to go back & spend a week in this pretty hotel. We were there for two nights and supposed to have breakfast each day but Sunday seems they forgot. Someone came in to check the tv but it started working on its own. The only positive thing was they let us leave with no charges. The staff was polite and helpful  also very  professional. This hotel should be imploded and build a new one. My family of four stayed here for the Christmas 2016 weekend. However, the bar/food is always closing or closed when we want to try it. Given time, it may improve, but they should advise guests that the hotel is under construction. Then they had an event going on and so much lobby noise. Then requested to be away from elevators and noisy area as we were there for a competition and would be up at 4 Am. The trash in my room was never removed during my 3 day stay and maybe that is why flies were abundant throughout the interior of the hotel. I had a plesant stay at this hotel, the staff was great, the Restaurant breakfast Buffet was very good. The comfort of the rooms with the separate living area is great. They had bottles of water, but cans of soda limited to sprite and coke...not satisfying for me bc I prefer Diet Coke. I love that management is constantly walking around and available. I assume the staff is well paid and taken care of because each employee from management to cleaning personnels, had a smile and would greet you. The front desk clerk was very nice and i was observing the other that was helping another couple. There is an en-suite bathroom with hairdryer; plus, the accommodation includes a microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker and two telephones. The attendant..Sherry?..was moving as quickly as possible and was very efficient in her processing and was soo nice when I finally got checked in that I forgot all about being invonvenienced for the under staffing! everything was perfect, the reservation, the room, the cordiality from the people of the hotel, the hotel location, near to a lot places Located off a major road, next to train tracks and a private business airport. The shuttle driver would give us a ride if we needed to pick something up from the Walmart etc. We booked the Club Level, and took advantage of it by eating the food they provided both am and pm. This is our go to place whenever staying in this area! Blanket had huge stain on it so ordered a new one and I was going to give her the other but she said throw it in the corner. Great staff except for the bar maid unfriendly and rude. Torn carpet could hear everything outside when the loud room air conditioner wasn't on , holes in walls that were patched but not painted and paper the front door pep hole because it had been punched out. Very comfortable bedding 2 lg screen TV's a plus,small kitchenette w/microwave and refrig great! The hot water faucet was broken and the tub draining super slow the first night. Great staff   Too bad the hotel itself is old and dummpy. Then we were informed that breakfast is only included Monday- Friday for club level. Some minor upgrades need to be made but nothing major. Hotel was very nice comfy, clean and the staff were very nice with customers any thing you need they were ready to help you. We loved our stay, the staff was very nice and accommodating. By them knowing it was out anniversary the service could've and should've been much better. Had to order pillows and blankets for the bed as it was not done up. One suggestion i have is for improvements in the bed linens. when i called downstairs they said nothing they could do that the event would be over soon (my only wish was that I got that extra day the same price) OWELL. Talked to front desk about possible refund/compensation and all they gave was 3 free breakfast buffet at their restaurant the next day. I had to buy my own coffee maker.because the one provided splashed the water all over, it was too small for the filter they provided. They put us in the first room next to elevator, on the second floor, over the bar. With our busy life we just needed to get away. The gym area and equipment were excellent, really nice workout resources there. Located next door to a Regal cinema & several Resturaunts! Extremely pricy for a 3 star hotel that felt like a 2 star hotel. I greatly appreciated the fridge and microwave; since i travel with hungry boys, i make sure I bring extra drink and snacks. They switched our rooms & the new rooms were dirty. Great breakfast, supreme location and mostly quiet during evening hours. Waterfall inside with turtles and fish, and a fake alligator! I had an issue for about 3days where my room key would stop working but one young receptionist took the time and choose her words very wisely to let me know I was using the key card wrong and that the cards are very sensitive. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served at the Terrace 555 Restaurant & Bar which overlooks the atrium and waterfall. Pool towel replenishment was understaffed, phone at the pool is just for ordering drinks. Additional features include computers in the lobby, 13,000 square feet of meeting space and the Sheraton Club Lounge and Club level rooms. Sade made sure we got a nice surprise once we finished touring the hotel property which was a nice gesture. The staff are friendly and the hotel rooms are very spacious Do NOT was money on “club level.” The snacks when we arrived were packs of peanut butter and jelly Ritz crackers (my son is allergic to peanuts so no snack for him). In the next day, room cleaning was finished at 5pm. Longhorn Steak House and Alfiere Mediterranean Bistro are among the other restaurants in the neighborhood. However, the hotel was pricey, I booked it including breakfast and for the price I paid, I was expecting hot food  to order type of breakfast including omelette. I did find it odd that there wasn’t a trash can in the bathroom. The only thing I would say is to update the furniture, carpets in the room. There is a concierge service, free access to the fitness center, free parking and complimentary Starbucks teas and coffees, plus free weekday newspapers. Staff had everything that we asked for.. Room was clean and comfortable and a/c worked perfectly because I love too be cold. Also the breakfast staff was more attentive to the other guests which was only 4 of them but we felt that they served them more because of their race also. Bathroom soap dish fell off, bathroom tub was not very clean. Only complain was that the breakfast buffet consisted of veggie egg omelets...that were cold. The Port Everglades Cruise Port is one of the nearby features. I didn't have the problem since.I had my children with me and let the receptionist know, she placed on the second floor where at night I could hear the peaceful waterfalls. Suites at Sheraton Suites Fort Lauderdale At Cypress Creek have a separate living area with pull-out sofa, two HDTVs and free high-speed Internet. The hotel is situated close to a small shopping center which has a movie theatre as well. Next day 1 tv stated no signal again, called desk again but tv started working again but engineer also showed up. Arrived and couldn’t even check it at the respective check in time. Walking into this hotel, we felt like we had arrived in a fancy resort! Check in at 3pm, but went to room at 4:15, because room is not ready. Lobby looked good very fancy, check in slowed by the front desk person chatting with a friend. This hotel has the potential to be really nice, but its a mess right now. Sheraton Suites Fort Lauderdale At Cypress Creek is a three-star, ‘all-suite’ hotel. In the evening they had cut veggies, cold sweet potato fries, and crackers with cheese. Heads up, it’s continental style breakfast and cost is $15 per person.
It wasn’t good experience of staying because many things weren’t working I would not recommend this hotel to anyone as there are many other choices. Has restaurant located within but food was poor and wait staff that didn’t care about service In-room kitchens feature coffee making facilities as well as free bottled water and all rooms are equipped with a work desk and lamp. Other recreational facilities include basketball courts, tennis courts and a sand volley ball court. Very convenient as they have a free shuttle that takes you to the airport. It was comfortable and centrally located to the business I had in Houston He fixed it and all was well until the middle of the night when I woke up freezing again. Maintence said to call 24/7 if any other problems, but who wants to get out of bed at 4:00 am, and get dressed for maintence man to come to your room? Disappointed with lack of bathroom counter and no in room refrigerator Did stay at this hotel once before that’s way I booked it but, the service this time was not as good and staff wasn’t as friendly. I left at 2:30 am due to roaches crawling in my bed!! The manager tried to accommodate us & even gave us free deserts! Although it was late at night, she did not have a uniform on, but was wearing unprofessional clothes. Both the van driver from the airport and the front desk clerk were clearly not in the mood to be there, and neither are a credit to the hotel. The AC was working way too well and my room was cold and it took most of the night to warm it up so I could get to sleep. Good Eats Bar is the on-site restaurant and bar offering a relaxed dining environment without leaving the hotel. It is much more like a Motel 6, and should be sold and re-named. When we got to the room, I saw black mold around two of the outlets. They don't know about gold premium status , no complimentary breakfast as usually in holiday in express worldwide Holiday Inn Houston-Intercontinental Arpt is a pet-friendly hotel located just five kilometres from the Houston Intercontinental Airport and offers guests a complimentary shuttle service to this location as well as other nearby places of interest. When I questioned the desk clerk, they said their phones were down but the shuttle was out running around. The clerk was pre-occupied and not very helpful in telling me how to get my room. And the rooms were filled but I heard no noise. I did get there very late on Saturday morning at 0100 am. I stay at Holiday Inn enough to become Platinum Elite, so when stuck in Houston due to weather delays, I looked for one. Though it is close to the airport I only heard 2 airplanes. Funny thing was, the desk phone rang while we were talking which was received by an embarrassed look by the clerk. Holiday Inn Houston-Intercontinental Arpt offers an indoor and outdoor pool, a 24-hour business centre and gym. Hotel is old and needs upgrade however front desk people are very professional Other options include room service or off-site dining at nearby restaurants including Gumbo Jeaux's. This hotel is not far from world-class shopping at Deerbrook Mall and is also convenient to Jesse H. Jones Park and Nature Reserve. Quick and friendly check-in, lovely clean room and especially clean and spacious bathroom easily accessible by handicapped travellers. Probably ready for updating but would definitely stay here again. One of the elevators was broken but wait wasn't long for the working one. Need to improve upon shuttle service to airport Need to change phone number at franchise end ie old on Google Good service, hotel is in bad shape, needs a renovation rush. I selected this hotel because it was close to the car rental center easy in or out. My room (and a friends room too) both smelled musty and the carpet even felt a little wet in my room. The shuttle never showed up at terminal C, even though I tried to call the hotel for over an hour. The elevators were so dirty and looked like they haven't been cleaned in days! The shuttle drive was very rude & even passed us up! The smell throughout the whole hotel would be required professionals to try to get rid of it. Walking down the hall, there were several rooms labeled with blue painters tape as being unusable. This is not one to stay at, as it is not even close to the standards of the chain. I let her know we waited over an hour for the shuttle and it never came. Called for maintence because the thermostat wasn't working and the room was freezing. It was just out the way & i expected better rooms I stayed at this hotel because it has an onsite restaurant and airport shuttle whuch is convenient when you stay for just one night. In fact, her first set of instructions took me to a parking lot, so I had to re-trace my steps and ask her again. Very nice to stay close to airport if taking off early the next morning. And decided to work out and could not because the AC was not working and dirty. As we were checking out the next morning, I asked where the coffee was. The whole hotel was under construction, and the whole hotel was best describes as a mess. We did find some litter in room but given meal vouchers to compensate which were most acceptable. There was no hot water when I tried to take a shower in the morning. Staff was nice, but this is a gross hotel by the airport. There is a lack if convenient electrical outlets to use in the rooms, and the elevators look like they've seen better days. Hotel was primarily used as an overnight stay during connecting flights so did not fully utilize the facilities. The hotel was spread out over a large area, so it was a long way to my room.
that said in the past we always enjoyed the sushi restaurant but on this stay the sushi menu was greatly reduce and the dining room not as comfortable. The Islands Restaurant has yummy food, I had the flatbread pizza. Wish bar area was in a better location, rather than main entryway . I was at the hotel for a 2 day conference. However we are giving them a low rating because when we left a note for 2 extra towels, the maid completely ignored the request. Walked back to the desk again and this time a maintenance man was sent to fix the problem. This is an older hotel, but in a convenient location and the price was decent during our stay. The hotel has 11 meeting rooms with DVD player and digital projector. They were kind enough to give me extras when I asked for some more. It was a great time staying at this hotel, staff was friendly and the lounge and dining facilities were excellent. Went back to my room and guess what, the cards still didn't work. We used their complimentary shuttle service to nearby areas and that was very helpful. The location is very convenient as well, the farthest we drove to do anything was about 10 minutes. The ceiling around the air conditioning vent was very dirty. The  maintenance man tried to fix the AC, he had to access a crawl space above the ceiling. There was a stench from the garbage or trash at the entrance which was unpleasant. Below average for the price...  $180+$13 parking per night. This was our second visit to the hotel and for the second time they forgot to clean our room. I waited in line for awhile both to check in and out i was the only one waiting. We had to ask for room service to clean the room it was not done automatically. It's too bad there was no time to enjoy the restaurants and other amenities. However I think the hotel will be even better if they upgrade the flooring, the carpet dark and it appears to be dirty. Called the desk and another maintenance man was sent to our room. The toilet kept making a loud noise throughout the whole night. When we finally got back in the room we noticed that it was pretty warm. The Crowne Plaza San Diego – Mission Valley is a three star hotel located in the city of San Diego, California. In our room, there’s was trash from the previous guest in the closest and the bathtub was dirty. Loved the sleep kit with body/room spray, which made the room and pillows smell like a spa. Minor flooding issue in our room due to a plumbing problem. The bar lounge was a perfect ending to the dAy. Hotel would not (or could not) address the problem when we reported it around 11pm. There is a business center with computer and printer for guests to use. The staff's  phone manner was a challenge, but in-person, they are very friendly and helpful. I don't expect places and people to be perfect, but I don't expect to have to ask three times to get an issue resolved, especially a cleanliness issue. There were never any towels at the pool or whirlpool by the evening time. easy check in, clean room and very good sushi bar in lobby. We set the food outside with the dirty dishes and had to ask three times over several hours for it to be removed. I guess it's ok for business travelers with company credit cards, buts it's not for families vacationing on a budget. Guests can go for a workout at the onsite health and fitness center or go for a swim at the outdoor swimming pool. We would not have stayed except it was getting late and we were travelling with an animal and it would have taken too long to find another pet friendly hotel that night. Breakfast is NOT included, we had to pay for the continental breakfast and the food was ok, I’ve had better. Hotel gave us a 50 percent refund but we still feel that we overpaid for such an awful experience. Even though rooms are 'non-smoking our room did have a tiny bit of a musty smoke smell. Cocktail bar ( great Bartenders), Good restaurant ( service a little slow), good size pool, shuttle to airport. Upon arrival, this hotel brought me back to the 1970s. There's nothing impressive or exceptional about the room including the bathroom, the elevator, the halls and the pool looKS and feel dirty. The hotel offer 417 guest rooms and 12 suites divided over 8 floors. It was a quick overnight stay because of a meeting scheduled for the next day. Hotel needs some updating, wallpaper in our room was peeling and much of the property looks like it needs some repair (elevators and exterior especially). The room was clean but extremely hot, unable to regulate the air conditioner, no cool air coming in so I opened the terrace door, no refrigerator, no coffee maker,is that an added amenity with incidental fee? Overall, will not return or recommend this hotel to anyone. Room are spacious, the pool is huge and nice hotel staff are nice and helpful. The heat did not work in the 2nd room, so they us a portable heater. A $40.00 withdrawal to my credit card as s deodot, $13.00 for parking not mentioned in the ad. We requested a room change and it was easily taken care of. The hotel was not too busy when we went, so easy access to the pool etc. No way to tell when a show starts or what is on later.... $13.00 dollars a day to park on the property...? I didn't like that they charge for parking.. but I guess that is most hotels.. hard to find a parking space.. very limited Breakfast was excellent, but tables were not cleaned off in a timely manner . After our first hotel messing up our reservation dates, the crowne had an opening and checked us in around 10pm. By this time we were pretty upset and asked if we could have another room. Every room has a microwave, a fridge, and a balcony (80% sure on that one). However, its exterior is now rusted, courtyard unpruned, parking lot dark, and rooms dingy. They charge for parking and there’s usually NO Parkin available. old hotel, the first thing I got were extra charges that were not in the initial quote, poor breakfast but extremely expensive ... the second day I got a charge to my credit card for ten dollars that they did not know how to explain ... . The people in the next room woke us up they we're arguing at 12:30am. I had to wait a while at the front desk because other people were having the same problem as me. The room was unnatractive and the headboard was loose and banged every time I moved. centrally located to the San Diego area......facility is old, but shows signs of remodeling...comfortable stay The hotel is near the highway and only a short drive away from downtown San Diego and the International Airport of San Diego. I was expecting a business class hotel; it was actually a luxurious resort. Woke up to a moldy smell and the carpet outside the bathroom and all around the back wall of bathroom in and out were drenched. All the guest rooms have cable/satellite television with in room movies, coffee making facilities, high speed internet access, work desk, telephone with voicemail, individually controlled air conditioning, iron, ironing board, in room safe and windows that can be opened. I walked a long way to the front desk and the cards were supposedly fixed. There is highway traffic noise on the South side facing room we had, (nothing that earlplugs can't solve if you're a light sleeper. There is rooms service from 6.06 am to 1.10 pm. The quality of motel 6 (no offense to motel 6) the name of Crown Plaza is very misleading. Upon our arrival, there was someone else's dirty dishes left outside of the door to our room. But next time I'd request a room on the North side. This is a great hotel for fun and business trips. Did not care for people smoking marijuana in the hotel other than that I would stay again Overall the hotel is good, the rooms are clean and it have easy access to I-8 and nearby attractions. It took us over 30 min to wait for someone to leave. Overall a very nice hotel, will be going back again. First I was put in a very unsafe area right off the freeway they change me to a different room but I woke up with bedbug bites on my arm not a good experience This hotel was undoubtedly very cute and charming years ago.
There are 24 hour fitness facilities on-site plus a rooftop terrace for guests to enjoy. The bathtub needs grip strips--too slippery for older people to stand in the tub and shower. The private bathroom contains a shower and bath tub combo plus free toiletries.

The room was smoke filled and smelled like someone had smoked a carton in there right before we checked in. I have pictures of how discussing the room was, it was never ever clean. The room said non smoking but smelled like cigarettes and had an ash tray in it. Room only included one wash cloth for the three of us.The room was supposed to be nonsmoking but smelled like nothing but smoke. Beds were hard, pillows and sheets were not even changed. One of the worst Motel 6s I have been in. But the electricity went out twice in my 3 days. Houston Rockets basketball followers can cheer on their heroes 20 miles away at the Toyota Center. The bed was pretty good I found myself sleeping pretty well. Room smelled of smoke even though it states non smoking room. Eateries located within half-a-mile include American diners and English-style pubs serving food plus Italian, Thai and Indian restaurants. the room smell bad, the bed was not made, they refused to give me another room and at night I very noisy Situated ten minutes’ drive from both Memorial City Mall and George Bush Park for outdoor recreation, Motel 6 HoustonTx - West is about 15 minutes from Funplex Amusement Park. From bad customer services, unclean rooms, people doing drugs around the hotel. But other than that, it was I enjoyed my stay. Over time of being in the hotel I started noticing roaches crawling around in the room! There is garbage throughout the hallways as the facilities are never cleaned. I dialed Zero to setup a wake-up call, but no one answered. Lol Also never once did I reserve a handicap room, why because I am not handicapped. After waiting 25 minutes just to speak to the receptionist I was advised to go back to the lobby to get another room , and then when I arrived I had to wait another 30 minutes because there was no one at the front desk no sign no nothing . and not 1 staff member had the decency to let hotel guest what the problem was, was not informed then of the DNRAR (do not rent a room) guest list, not to mind you had 2 change rooms several times because of the nastiness of the Housekeepers, and its not like i have OCD or sum, jus saying that rely back on management, stayed again on 4/9/18, went to pay(try), and thats when I was told I was on the DNRAR list, if thats so why it did not pull up the night before, these people are full of it, they don't stand up to there name, and oh yea they do not LEAVE THE LIGHT ON FOR YOU!! It was the most disgusting place, please do not stay there, clogged bathroom hair in the tub, the floor was so dirty l had to throw my socks away. It could’ve been better if it didn’t smell smoking in an elevator or stairs. Good stay and quiet but not happy about not having free wifi. The woman behind the counter seemed to be lost while trying to handle the guest's transactions. It’s a pretty ghetto type of hotel, but that’s why it’s so cheep. we requested a smoking room and recieved a nonsmoking withburns in the bedding. The hotel management gave me a refund due to how bad the rooms were. Booked the room for my 9 year old daughter's birthday and she did not enjoy it at all. The bathroom definitely needed an update, or at least a good cleaning, but nothing about the stay was too terrible. There were towels that were ripped to make into smaller towels. Mold was in the bathroom and obvious burn marks were in the bathtub. And carried my luggage up 3 flights of stairs bc I’ll never use it again, plus smelled like urine. We supposedly were in a nonsmoking room, but it still smelled strongly of smoke. The hotel manager, housekeepers, maintenance man, (Patricia) , is so unprofessional, put me and my husband on a do not rent a room list all because we called corporate and complained about the lights had been out for over 7 hrs. It's not a safe place for you and anything park in there lot. I can't believe they let a place like that exist, or that expedia sells their rooms. microwave in lobby did not work, and ice taste like mold. Did not stay and would not give a refund although no one could stay in a room with mold would have gotten sick. The motel was wonderful but no coffee pot to make a cup of coffee or microwave to heat some things up in I asked why he said no one outside after ten, thought I was grown I'm sorry. Very disappointed that they wouldn't even call and let me know that my reservation could not be honored  Having to find another place when I was so exhausted and falling asleep from a long drive was very inconvenient  The only reason I booked there was location and I needed to safely get off the road so as to not fall asleep driving  Service 0 and everything else 0 because I received 0, not even consideration Called front desk he stated come to office might have one. The only reason this wasn’t a 1 was bc the took itself was decent. Was told by front desk staff they would not be able to accommodate me. All guests are allowed to smoke in all rooms and hallways. No one should b allowed to rent a room like that HEALTH HAZARD! We were informed by staff that they clean & empty garbage only 1 time per week. the beds had cigarette burns in a non smoking room. Does have plenty of places to go for dining and shopping nearby. Not a fan of the charge-for-wifi or the fact that there was only one ice machine, near the lobby, especially since we were in the back on the third floor. And there were no mini fridge or microwaves in room or that I saw around facility. I went to the hotel and the 2 rooms that were offered were not stayable. I was surprised that continental breakfast was not served as most motels I have stayed for the same price offer a light breakfast. Also they give 2 bath towels, 2 face towels, & 2 washcloths for that week. First motel  I have ever stayed at that the toilet paper was half used. It was hard to get to from HOU and kind of sketchy from the outside- not to mention I found multiple screws and even a straight razor blade in the parking lot. Room was very clean, and the staff was very helpful. Motel 6 HoustonTx - West provides simple low-cost accommodation at modern premises beside Interstate 10 in the Energy Corridor suburb about 20 minutes’ drive west of downtown Houston, Texas. Well that’s a lie because I was told I would have to purchase the WiFi but also that I was unable to purchase it because it was down Worst hotel ever, roaches crawling on me in my sleep. The bed was lumpy with ridges running from head to toe. Very dirty and smelled of cigarettes even in non-smoking room. My children did not want to even take a bath. I arrived at the hotel and there were 2 other guest in front of me. Amenities comprise a launderette, lift, seasonal outdoor swimming pool, 24-hour reception, vending machines and paid Wi-Fi throughout. WOW, then I stepped out of room door and was told by a cop who was called to property. I could not cancel and ended up having to find other accommodations. Yes just one he had no more at all 3 people one trial size. Also it is advertised that they have free WiFi . I attempted to check in and was promptly told that they hadn't had electricity since 5pm the day before. So we stood in line for a while just to get a room. I want to say food was stuck to pillowcase but I'm not even sure what it was. Then when the phone rings, instead of answering and asking the person on the phone if they can please hold for a brief one to two minutes, she stops handling the guest that she was working on and starts helping the guest on the phone first. 2017, the hotel is still using a wire internet, and $5/day for Wi-Fi password. Signs all over property lock your cars not responsible for break ins. We cleaned everything with clorox wipes, people were being arrested on the side when we got there. Just imagine the people residing there if it’s about $45/night. The bathroom is a mess with very low water pressure. The room was clean but in need of new flooring and a new mattress. Room was dirty, towels stained, shook roaches outside of my pillow. Service was horrible the first room I got was really dirty and the tv didn’t work . Bright, remodelled rooms featuring air-conditioning and en suite bathrooms with granite countertops boast 32-inch flat-screen cable TVs with free expanded channels, wood-effect flooring, free local calls and desks. Shower head has weak water pressure and lukewarm water, not hot.Bed uncomfortable. Sink faucet would splash out even at very low pressure. That I had to be in room with door closed. Hard to find, little to no restaurants around, and charged for the Wifi--seriously! Paid extra for wi-fi and it had a horrible connection. Ended up buying bleach to try and clean make comfortable for them. I like coming to stay at this hotel but early this morning the people next to me argued all morning I could hear the entire argument! The room is clean, but update for toilet and bathtub are seriously needed. Me and my girlfriend celebrated a day in houston and used motel6. The bed is ok but prefe a little more comfortable bed.
I was disappointed when we checked in that we weren't told about any of the amenities the hotel offered. Guests select from an elegant assortment—placing ideals of renewal and rejuvenation at the forefront their conceptual design—of rooms. This trip was to provide us a rest after Thanksgiving and Christmas events and family visits but it provided a nightmare. Guests might fancy taking a dip in the heated indoor pool—perfect for those rainy days when beach-attendance is ill-advised. Don't fall prey to the hype of other resort hotels. Carpet was dirty and had toilet running (need plumbing work) This time I did not enjoy my stay, my bed was made wrong (see pic).. To make matters worse the maid accused me of leaving my maltese alone in the room and reported me to the front desk. However, I am suppose to get 10k point instead for the SPG awards program. Westin Town Center even provides residents with shoe shining services. First of all, if she had tried to come in the room she would have noted someone had to be in there as the security latch can only be locked from the inside and also if there were any questions about my absence, they could have called the phone in the room. Breakfast in the cafe produced poorly cooked scones - overcooked and hard on the outside and undercooked inside. I was just looking for a room for 1 night, too bad I didn't have cause to stay longer. It was a decent day what I expected - the fire alarm going off at 1:30 in the morning! Only thing I got placed on the floor with the dog owners. I had to listen to barking and banging in the morning. The room was poorly maintained and the lobby was freezing. Everyone was nice and helpful the location is perfect and the hotel it self is very clean im telling everyone this is the hotel to stay at. Towels were not as “heavenly” as the bed and had to call down repeatedly for replacement towels. We had ask for at least a refund for the first night misery but they could not do it because we had booked and paid thru Travelocity. Prior to this we had been visited by 2 cleaning staff members one saying it was not his room but would come back at 1:00PM and another say they would com back at 4:00PM. The first day after one night stay we had to ask 3 different times for our room to be cleaned. Carpets had a footy odor and the Air Conditioning unit (on the roof outside) was LOUD. Great staff to assist within the hotel and the local outside activities. The staff was prompt with dealing with our noisy neighbors, I think they were throwing the ball against the adjoining door, but it was handled as soon as I called the front desk, TV remote wasn't working, maintenance came and gave us a new remote. Designer beds and bath tubs are inclusive to each en-suite lodging, as well. I have stayed in many Westin Hotels and this by far was in the worst condition for only being in existence for 10 years. It finally got cleaned at 8:00PM where we had to wait in the lobby of the hotel. Its her way of warning  me that someone is near or there is unexplained presence nearby. The ladies at the front desk were super friendly and very helpful! Great location.. attending a performance at the Sandler Center which was located across the street. We are seniors and this is too much work to relax. Feet had to touch the mattress protector because who ever made it did not stretch the sheets all the way from top to bottom.. Woke up in the middle of the night uncomfortable and had to move to the other bed (luckily it was made right). When booking with Westin Town Center, 35-miles of coastline permit fun-filled days at the beach. We have stayed at this hotel many times since it opened and found that it has not kept up to the standards of the chain. Executive chefs utilize only the freshest of organic ingredients to prepare the meals served in this coastal hotel’s Interlude Restaurant. It appears that the front desk and the room cleaning staff are not working together as a team. This hotel offered the most disappointing experience for me and the wife. They stated that we had to tell them when exactly we were out to the room. Although they do have a nice bar, the restaurant was extremely disappointing. It goes without saying that I would not recommend this hotel. I got a great deal on the room and was not at all expecting a 4+ star experience. We overheard the other staff person explaining these to another family checking in and had to ask several times to get any information. Well...if you have people going in and out of doors, slamming them, at all hours of the night and early morning, of course she's going to bark. I was disappointed because the tub would not drain during the shower. One of the doors of the cupboard containing the fridge was barely hanging by one hinge. I would stay here evertime i come to va beach this is the perfect hotel. Flat-screen television, direct-dial telephones, and complimentary toiletries secure that oft-longed for homely welcome. This pet-friendly luxury hotel features both valet and covered-self parking. I called the first night for it to be fixed and it never was It was a short overnight trip to attend a funeral/memorial service....convenient and close to shopping and restaurants. On the plus side, the employees at the hotel were very nice and accommodating. We needed to change our dates staying but the hotel had a no change/ cancellation no refund policy. Staff was extremely accommodating won our first room was unsatisfactory. The Restaurant was closed and is now used only for banquets---thus the only restaurant is in the bar area. We have given a manager and the front desk times we would be out of the room to clean but that did not happen. When using sink, hot and cold water was very hot, and continued to get hotter with use. Seemed offended that I had booked their hotel thru a third party. The only thing I didn't like was paying over $306 for one night for a room that had hair on the bathroom ceiling and shower wall. Maintenance issues in our room had not been dealt with, like faucetry in bathroom etc. Location a little weird, and parking deck is meh..... but once you are inside it is very relaxing. Bustling with shopping outlets, dining establishments, and historic sites—among other city-center attractions—, the residence of Westin Town Center places guests within convenient reach of it all. The bathroom was superficially clean but lots of accumulated dirt around the faucets and in corners.
Each is equipped with a satellite TV, personal safe, and a private bathroom with toiletries and hairdryer. The Museu Calouste Gulbenkian is only a 15-minute walk from this establishment. All rooms are fully air-conditioned and have overlooking views of the city. St. George's Castle and Gare do Oriente are within a 20-minute drive from the property. Breakfast meals can be enjoyed either in the Horizonte dining room or in the bedroom. Situated right across the Parque Underground Metro station in the vibrant heart of Lisbon, Residencial Horizonte offers recently renovated rooms and wireless Internet access all throughout. Residencial Horizonte features a 24-hour front desk that offers concierge and transportation services. Laundry facilities and a common lounge area are also available on-site. The on-site bar serves a variety of refreshing beverages, light snacks, and fresh coffee.
The bathroom floor tiles and wall tiles were stained, plumbing had no issues, but bathroom door could not close tight. Hotel seemed clean, yes it could use a facelift and there were a couple stains on carpets and on one of our lampshades. there was a roach on the elevator the room was filthy the floors were not vacuum to my whole stay the shower was dirty everything was bad about this hotel the hot tub was not hot lukewarm with broken Jets the pool was in bad condition paint chipping I really don't know how this hotel is running why they haven't been flagged just f****** disgusting I did have noisy neighbors but that could happen at any hotel. The room was extremely humid, as in you walk on floor and your socks get wet...you probably don't want to walk on floors barefoot they are so dirty. We did not try because the food is not appealing to us. The hotel is in an abandoned area with nothing of significance by it so the road is ideal for racing-if thats your sort of thing, apparently the police and hotel staff don't care. Would of liked to be nearer food places within walking distance 2.5 out of 5 Definately areas of improvement to be made. The hotel did not have our reservation from Expedia when we arrived. Aside from the smell of the hallways, it was worth the stay.... It was a little noisy but not a deal breaker. Still trying to figure out why I still have a $20 pending transaction.... And I checked out on 8/3 ... it's now 8/9 Love the fact close to the beach just 10 minutes away. When I asked a question she said it was whatever I booked online like I didn’t deserve service since I booked online . The light in the balcony is on all night long, you cannot turn it on or off, so light is coming in your room all night long. My room no curton had to change dress in room only need to use bathroom. There are no curtains in the room, the only thing they have are the sheer curtains, which block absolutely nothing. Due to the run down conditions, I would not stay in this hotel again. We were just passing through for the eclipse and so did not address the above issues with hotel staff. Not clean,  Room Carpet bathroom floor was very sticky and hall way was smoke smell. But as soon as you turn the corner towards the elevators and guest rooms you could smell nothing but the damp, old, and extremely MUSKY carpets. When we got there there was only 1 person serving everyone! I personally won't be back, but the staff was super nice. It was a reasonable price to begin with, but Expedia upped the price when I logged in. The hotel room was on the second floor above the outdoor pool. This lodging was experienced in the off-season with not many residents. waited 20mins and left to eat at the restaurant next door. Hotel was good for the price just wish we had the view on lake side rather than the parking lot. I had to do my Web based work in the lobby. That did it for me, that and when I pulled up the mattress to check for bedbugs there was trash and hair and dirt under the mattress linen.. no thanks. The beds were comfy and the room was clean and cool....and without the odor of the hall! I would expect the motorcycle noise if it was bike week-this was just a ridiculous number of rude idiots racing out in front of the hotel all night long-and yes I mean ALL NIGHT. Staff was excellent, Will on night shift was very courteous and helpful when we needed to change rooms. There is no one watching the pool area so kids do whatever they want, running around- turning the jets on/off, etc, eating in the pool 3. I will not stay here again until it is upgraded. The toilet handle was falling out of the toilet, so we had to take the cover off the toilet to pull the float up to flush-which the bowl inside was so black it looked like sewer water. All 148 rooms feature air-conditioning, cable TV with HBO, free Wi-Fi, coffee makers, hair dryers, irons and ironing boards, small refrigerators and work desks. LUCKILY, the actual guest rooms were like night and day from the halls of the hotel. Tried to get internet to work by letting me call their internet provider instead of doing it for me. If your looking to stay close to everything then this isn't the place, ask for a room overlooking the harbor, and there was hair everywhere. It was a horrible experience and can only say stay away! The Clarion Hotel is within walking distance of the Coastal Grand Mall and less than a 10-minute drive from WonderWorks, Ripley’s Aquarium, the Boardwalk, the Sky Wheel and the Family Kingdom Amusement Park. Upon check-in, I asked the girl who checked me in if i needed a deposit or key to safe and she said no, the safes are in the room, no key needed. This breakfast buffet was a joke and the people working in there don't really answer questions. The hotel offers an indoor-outdoor pool, a hot tub, a gym, a game room and guest laundry. Hotel is in an abandoned mall area with not much nearby. The hotel itself was extremely noisy-with people fighting in the halls/rooms and motorcycles. We called the front desk and they gave us the phone number of the company that handle their wifi system. The room we had in the far end could not connect to the internet. I go to my room and inspect room before unpacking, to my surprise, no safe.... Quite comfortable, good amenities, but WiFi was basically not there. Needs a microwave... but all in all it was great! I am not a picky person but this has been the most uncomfortable stay to say the least- 1. it is not very clean, there are stains all over carpet, bathrooms are icky, hallways smell like humidity, moisture and mildew 2. the pools are gross, the Jacuzzi is disgusting. Staff was nice, view was good, breakfast was not continental but was good and not too expensive. The only thing is the electrical outlets should be updated as some of the plugs do not hold your plug it falls back out and one outlet you could pull out of the wall. So loud in the parking lot and street sounded like there were motorcycle races going on all night-not bike week so just rude people racing and raving engines all night, why the police and hotel staff accept the is beyond me, hotel staff said this is normal...if you need to sleep don't stay here The breakfast buffet is $8.50 per person and does not really offer buffet options. Hotel nice locate , but hotel need remodeling old furniture in room and rust on doors and in bathroom. I have been to the one in florida and THAT is a buffet. The sink didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush properly. The hallways smelled HORRIBLE and it was very warm, humid, and sticky feeling. Coffee in the morning is not available until 7 AM. Before I booked, I checked online to see if the rooms had safes, I did not see it on the website so I decided to call. The room itself was in ok condition except for minor repairs needed in the bathroom. We asked the staff at checkout about the noise and racing, the response was Its always like this So if you value your sleep don't stay here. Renovation ongoing, but room was clean, nice towels and bedding. The room was clean and comfortable enough especially for the rate. Only a short drive from the Atlantic Ocean, the Clarion Hotel offers quiet surroundings and easy access to all of Myrtle Beach’s attractions. greagreat place to stay price wa decent the restuarant prices were low the restauran staff was nice I see renovations going on in lobby, hopefully they well start removing and replacing carpet. We were also charged $4 more than what we were quoted at booking. Save yourself the trouble, drive the one mile down the road to Bob Evans and have yourself a much better breakfast than what this hotel offers. The hotel room carpet was dirty and wet, smelled like a gallon of orange glow was dumped to hide the musty smell. The girl checking us in could have cared less whether we were there or not. We probably would not stay here again unless there were no other choice. Whoever picked up the phone said they did have in room safes. If you travel for work it is a necessity to have Internet in your room. It is located in an out-of-the-way, isolated, dark zone that undermines feelings of safety, security. Guests can enjoy a complimentary breakfast, and 101 West Restaurant & Lounge features daily happy hour and serves drinks and dinner with a lovely view of the waterway. We called them and they said nothing they can do due to hardware problem. The room had an odor, dirty carpet, door was lefted open one day. The room smelled like someone dumped a gallon of orange glow in it to hide the musty smell-so strong it burned our throat. Okay, so let me start by saying- you get what you pay for. Upon entering the hotel it smelled and looked very clean. There was a smell in the room that didn't really ever go away. Carpet felt very sticky and left our sock felty black. The sink stopper was broken and the toilet fill float got stuck a few times not refilling the tank. The hotel was obviously undergoing some renovation of the restaurant and lobby. The river view which I paid extra was nice but the balcony is tiny. Was quiet,  had a mini fridge but would have been nice to have microwave. Not a good hotel to stay in if you are traveling for work. The hotel has a pool, which we didn't use,  but left water everywhere especially the elevator. After a long drive we wanted to have room service and were told to go to the restaurant as nobody answered the phone there! No internet in rooms; needed to go to common area. The three Executive Suites further boast upscale furnishings, a sleeper sofa, a microwave, a wet bar and a separate sitting area.
I was perfectly situated and in walking distance to Times Square, Rockfellow Center, and 5 Avenue. I realized you could get a mini fridge brought to the room near the beginning of this 8-day trip and this was a GODSEND especially during the bad weather. Room cleaned daily to high standard.24 hour room service if needed. We enjoyed sitting outside in the mornings with coffee and in the evenings to relax. Got free wifi to compensate though (but why would you charge $15 per day for wifi in a top hotel??). Perfect location near to grand central terminal, rocker Della and radio city music hall. It's rather plain with no free wifi or coffee bar in room, but Starbucks is across the street. We walked to Broadway, Times Square, and to Central Park. The day we arrived, we couldn't get an early check in, but were offered use of the steam room and showers in the spa to freshen up, which was fantastic even after a relatively short travel time. There were no coffee or tea making facilities in the room, which was disappointing, especially as room service was pretty expensive, I think 33usd for a continental breakfast for example, although I am sure it would have been lovely. Last thing--whatever the satellite TV service is at the hotel sucks; most channels didn't work most of the time due to weather, even light rain. We walked from the hotel to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, and Broadway. We had a slight issue at breakfast but many thanks to dining manager Eddie whom went above & beyond in correcting it. We had a family emergency during our stay and had to leave early. The rooms were spacious, the bed was comfortable, the location was terrific, and we had a gorgeous view of the breathtaking St. Patrick's Cathedral. They found me within hours and brought it back to me. Checked in and  was given a key that did not work,  I had to come back down to get the key activated. Great hotel great staff great location close to shopping and time square We stayed here to be near a wedding venue and it is now our favorite NY hotel. In retrospect, I should have asked if they had different pillows. Getting checked luggage out of storage took way too much time and the process seemed disorganized. We had had drinks at the Palace when it was owned by the Helsley family. Elegant spacious room with great views but surprising gaps in amenities such as coffee maker. We were thrilled to have a view overlooking St Patrick’s Cathedral. My only complaint about the hotel is that the beds were not too comfortable and the pillows were not firm. They all wNted to help-with our luggage, hailing a taxi or just giving us direction around the city! This Midtown Manhattan hotel features 909 spacious rooms and suites – including 176 newly renovated exclusive Towers accommodations – which provide the perfect setting for relaxation and inspired stays in New York City. The hotel’s famed Villard Mansion built in 1882 is recognized as a New York City landmark and gracefully blends with a contemporary 55-story tower. Location great for business,spacious and well appointed rooms and attentive service. I left my credit card in the hotel at a table. This is absolutely my favorite place to stay in the city! The location of the Lotte couldn't have been any better. And thank goodness I picked it, since NY was hit with not one but TWO Nor'Easters during the week I was there. We got charged for items from the mini bar, as we moved them around to put something of our own in to cool down, but this charge was reversed. This hotel has the biggest rooms I have experienced in this price range. Biggest problem was no grab bars in bathroom, making it very difficult for aging knees to get in and out of otherwise excellent tub. Breakfasts in the dining room were delicious and the service was excellent. A couple of glitches...water shutoff for a bit on Sat & incorrect mini bar charges which had to be removed. The rooms are so spacious & well-appointed, & the location is extremely convenient, whether you are shopping, going to the theater, or wanting to eat at fabulous restaurants! 2. given a room facing a blank wall, wouldn't book there again if that was only room available Check-in was smooth, room was clean and large, staff was friendly and helpful. The New York Palace Hotel is a 7 block walk or cab from Grand Central Terminal. On the 37th floor, we had a beautiful view of both St. Paul's Cathedral and the Rockefeller Building. Getting Internet to work was a disaster-took 40 mins on phone with a tech to log in-and they rip you off $15 when you already paid top dollar for room.Surprisingly gym did not have sanitary wipes to clean off machines. Check-in and Check-out were both poor experiences with long lines and staff that gave incorrect information. Lotte New York Palace’s collection of versatile meeting and event spaces is ideal for weddings, corporate events and social occasions. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet this hotel was given how large it is and its location in the center of the city. I mean come ON, more than $50 for a small bowl of clear-broth chicken soup and a single glass of white wine??!? We were on the 17th floor, with no particular view, but the lift zoomed up there in no time. We had a room on the 34th floor with view over St Patricks cathedral. The hotel was very close to Radio City Music Hall where we attended an event. Our room was clean and comfortable and much needed after walking all day! I think the location and the managers and staff are the best features. Fairly recently refurbished and remains one of the highest quality and best located hotels in mid town manhattan. That being said, I would stay again b/c it was very nice and super convenient. Fantastic view from our room overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller building. Was disappointed that to get ice it required you to call room service. Also, only one pillow was left on each each bed (because that was the number of people on the reservation). A room with 2 queens would be nice but I was not able to find this at the price I was targeting. Otherwise loved the hotel and will definitely stay there again. The room was clean and spacious with a great view overlooking St Patrick’s Cathedral. Unique dining venues, such as Pomme Palais, offer everything from imaginative breakfast dishes to signature pastries and sandwiches. The Madison Avenue Courtyard provides a dramatic entryway to the hotel’s grand lobby. It was quiet, luxurious, modern and had an amazing view. Very helpful staff especially Rebecca Villasenor - Guest service agent. This was a quick site-seeing to celebrate our daughters 10th Birthday. The staff was attentive and helpful, certainly what we’d expect from a luxury hotel. Although we had prepaid, and we were beyond the required notification period to cancel, the management was accommodating and  allowed us a refund for the unused portion of out stay. There were other similar examples but you get the idea. This is the BEST hotel in nyc...it is in a great location and so BEAUTIFUL.. Lotte Palace was extremely accommodating and warm throughout our two night trip. We had two double beds which is normal for NYC hotels and the room was far more spacious than the other hotels we've stayed at in New York. In for VD weekend which was what we were looking for It was also and easy walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park. I had a corner room on the 37th floor with spectacular cityscape views from a  gorgeous, immaculate, spacious, opulent room. Amenities were in grand style and staff could not have been more helpful. I like to have little snacks and a light breakfast in my room and not have to pay the ridiculous room service prices for it. The hotel is picturesque complete with a grand staircase and St. Patrick's Cathedral, located across the street, is visible from its courtyard. Only negative comment would be around pricing of additional items - food, minibar, internet was outrageously high but probably consistent with many other hotels in this class. All staff very helpful - from Front Desk/ Reception to Concierge, Housekeeping and Doormen. If I could bottle the “service” and sell it, I’d be rich. Very close to Rockefeller Plaza and not too far of a walk to Central Park or Theaters depending on how much you like to walk. Every attention to detail was noticeable, and there was not even one hitch during our three-day stay. Close to shopping and sights with subway station at end of street. Without hesitation whatsoever, I will return to Lotte NY Palace time and again; the search for perfection is over. Took my daughter to NYC to celebrate her 13th birthday. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay. Being a overnight stay, we did not have time to check out all of the lounges and  restaurants. Thank you so much from this Texan who was impressed by the New York state of mind. The staff was very friendly and offered great travel instructions for visiting the city. Thought it to be too expensive....but just as reasonable as others we have stayed at for business and pleasure. two problems, one I was billed for services I didn't use, this was corrected but check bill! The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. We did have issues getting the maid service to stock the rooms appropriately for 4 people and had to call each night, which was frustrating. Of course they are not the only hotel that does this room service price-raping, but it's just horrid, in my view, particularly when there's not an in-hotel casual dining option. I had to call couple of times to resolve one issue. Very elegant hotel,  huge corner room with west facing view of St Patrick's cathedral. Dining in the historic mansion part of the hotel is a must -- but be prepared to laugh at the prices. The Lotte New York Palace – a legendary New York City luxury hotel – underwent a thorough transformation from a historic Madison Avenue gem to Midtown’s premier modern hotel. Revolutionary, innovative and inspiring – welcome to a brand new Lotte New York Palace. I wanted to order breakfast but decided against it after the entire experience and felt it wouldn't have been good. Thereafter it was bought by a Saudi group, and now is owed by Lotte. With a nod to its illustrious past, Lotte New York Palace has taken an ambitious leap into the future. As a native Nee Yorker , this was a wonderful experience. What really set this hotel apart is the customer service. I usually prefer more modern hotels to this one, but I picked the Lotte for this stay because it was likely to be cold and it's across the street from our NY office, and the price per night wasn't exorbitant (this time). In addition it was my daughter’s birthday and management said that they were going to send up a cake or cookies and no one did. Beds great, large rooms and staff so helpful they even supplied box and tape to mail home for my overflow luggage. The room was huge- much bigger than we are typically used to. The only negatives were the long line to check in on a busy holiday weekend, and one of the bellhops was rude. The staff proved courteous and friendly always, and the atmosphere had an absolutely positive buzz of energy throughout the day and evening. Lincy most generously checked us in early and upgraded our room and presented my son with a stunning box of chocolates from the hotel's on-site Pomme Palais. Travel Industry Manager, Stephanie and Daniel, Sales Coordinator, are why we keep  coming back. When I wanted to stay an extra night they raised the rate $200 so I went elsewhere. I give them a two because at 10:30 am the water shut off in the bathroom, earlier at 8.30 I could hear the  maid service thud and bump their carts down the hallway. Stayed here last June and that is why we went back! Extremely helpful concierge,  Pomme served a.m. coffee needs adequately,  front desk couldn't be nicer or more professional. There is a large lounge and a lovely bakery on site. The hotel staff was accommodating, professional and informative and our room was clean, comfortable and spacious and we had a view of the beautiful cathedral from our window. When I work late and want just a light bite it shouldn't cost $50-75--it's unconscionable. Was told wi-fi there would be no charge for wi-fi and was billed for it (charges were removed when I brought to their attention). Nothing was too much trouble for staff.Stunning forecourt and reception rooms. What put the stay at the Lotte was the staff. I was impressed by all of them and I wish I could remember all of their names but there were so many helpful people eager to help in any way. Courtyard was nice to have to sit and visit on the summer evenings. Their professionalism,  follow through, and hospitality is what make the extraordinary difference. Great things about the hotel: service from housekeeping and room service was fantastic the whole time, the size of the room was quite generous by NYC standards, and everything seemed to be in pretty good condition. In fact we got a large bedroom, with seating, and windows on 2 sides, and beautiful furnishings and mirrors and lamps. When we looked around some of the facilities (function rooms) in the old part of the hotel, they were truly luxurious. The location and the views from this hotel are outstanding. The only problem Was no television service but the hotel allowed us to view movies for the children at no charge. We got such a good price for our 5 night stay through Wotif that I joked to my friends that I thought we might be staying in the broom cupboard. The rest of the staff was great, though, esp the doormen! We truly appreciated their understanding and solidified our fantastic impression of this hotel. We arrived prior to stated check-in time and though there were no rooms in the class we reserved they offered other alternatives so we could check in immediately. Hotel needs to sort out plumbing and TV issues which should be easy to fix. Not the room we requested (Queen rather than 2 doubles), which would have been very inconvenient if we'd needed the other bed, but our party size changed so were OK! Very comfortable,  wonderfully located, would’ve loved to have the availability for lunch or dinner. The Lotte NY Palace far exceeded any expectations for my son's surprise 13th birthday weekend in NYC. With the price of your stay, it is disappointing that it seems they try to get every additional dollar out of you al la carte. The bathroom was large, clean and updated and the room had a large closet with plenty of hangers, extra pillows and blankets. My only niggle would be that a hospitality tray for tea / coffee would be good..First class all round. It was everything we could have asked for, the staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave my daughter a tiara and a stuffed bear. It was a lovely room with fantastic view over midtown (looking west). George, who was positioned outside, was funny and personable and so very quick to help with a taxi or whatever. It was a lovely place to stay at the end of our holiday, and a respite from the madness of New York within it's walls! Birthday celebration with my family  at NYC's Lotte hotel was exceptional. Overall though, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back! The hotel was our home base for our quick New York City adventure and is one block from Rockefeller Center, a 15 minute walk to Times Square (big city blocks) and the subway. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. High tech entry card is not swiped but waved near a entry pad. Love this hotel it's the 2nd time we've stayed here and will come back! Loved the hotel, room was really spacious and comfortable but was right next to the lift shaft which was quite noticeable at night. If I have any complaint, it would be that the pillows on the beds were very lacking. It was very family friendly, and the staff were very helpful. Sadly, more hallway noise than any from outside,  but that was just guest-factor.
We’re very pleased with the room Accessible to our families and very quiet l don’t know when fiesta Texas is open for the season any way it was very nice Breakfast was good, although it leaned more in the direction of carbs than my preference. Upon asking were I could get a good steak I was informed of many choice restaurants and directions to find them. Furthermore, the San Antonio Museum of Art is about a half hour away by car. What I didn’t like was the lack of details, in the pics they show a game room and golf. Had a great time and was nice to come back to a cleaned room and made beds. The hotel staff was friendly, the whole hotel and room smelled amazing. If you're following google maps to the hotel, be alert as you are approaching the exit or are on the 1604 access road:  the turn-in is not well marked, and comes up quickly. Although it was cold outside they were people at the pool and our window was right next to the pool. Would like for them to advertise that more clearly so people know before booking. Had to spray perfume on the pillow in order to try to make it through the night. The shower head was broken (coming out of the wall but working). Furthermore, guests can get advice from staff members about where else to enjoy meals. A 20-minute drive from SeaWorld, the property is just over nine miles from Ingram Park Mall. Booked this hotel while visiting for a baseball tournament in Boerne. There's a Walmart pretty close to the hotel, where I picked up a carton of Diet Coke with which to load the In-room fridge. A free hot breakfast comes with the cost of every room. We did call and stayed on hold for a wholeness with bank just to be told there’s was no hold and in fact the hotel had homemade through and money was taken out already. Also we only had 30 min to check in and freshen up before going to our games and not getting in till 11 that night. I just needed to stay for the night, so I wasn’t needing many amenities. We stayed at this hotel for a night and everything was great. When I arrived the staff was great and easy to check in. The only complaint I had room-wise was that the bathroom was a little snug, but that wasn't a huge deal. The real coffee available to make in my room was much better, so long as I used bottled water--the tap water tastes bad. The lady checking us in told me our card was declined and that I needed to call bank bc they probably put a hold on it since we traveled out of state. We had a great time on the property and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Biscuits, gravy, french toast, sausage, eggs, waffles, assorted muffins, scones, oatmeal, cereal, etc! This hotel is a smoke-free property with an outdoor pool. The rooms were very clean, the staff very helpful, security was decent, the beds themselves leave a lot to be desired. I don't like the taste of Pepsi products (apart from Aquafina water, which, as with all plain RO processed water, contains no minerals and thus tastes pretty flat when just drinking it, but is great for making coffee). Needless to say she checked their back system and sure enough the charge went through and it was a glitch on their end. Property is showing its age, but is pretty clean and comfortable. Overall it was a nice hotel but it could use a little work with being cleaned. Pool was a bit chilly for me but the kids loved it. It was excellent easy to check in, rooms where clean and smell fresh, excellent beds, the breakfast was more than we expected warm and keep area well clean... very satisfied recommended price was very affordable. My only real complaint was the coffee in the breakfast area:  it is semi-instant--dispensed from a machine that mixes coffee concentrate syrup with hot water. The staff was very friendly, however the room was outdated and very musty. Oh yeah, the mini golf is not free $10 per person. Room was nice in safe area i would stay here again No biggie mistakes happen but it did result in us not having any time before our game. All in all I felt safe it was clean and it was a family environment. Microwaves and refrigerators are provided, along with coffee makers and hair dryers. The guests above were so loud, but mainly because I could hear every single footstep. Staff was friendly and helpful and room was clean and comfortable. Stayed for 4 nights,everything was very nice,staff went out of their way to assist in whatever you asked. So then when my son wanted to play the game room the next day for only one hour before us checking out and I was told we had to pay I felt a little upset bc they could of at least gave him that considering the aggravation they caused while check n Be sure you have twice the room amount in your bank as they authorize the charges twice and it can take up to a week for the charge to drop off. Mind you I already paid for room before arriving so this was just for them to hold my card for a deposit in case any damages. The Quality Inn & Suites SeaWorld North (formerly Quality Inn & Suites Bandera Pointe) is a family-friendly hotel that offers budget rates and stupendous service. We had to switch rooms the night we got there because bugs but the other room the bathroom didn’t look like it was cleaned very well. While staying at the Quality Inn & Suites SeaWorld North, guests can watch cable programming on 27-inch TVs or connect to complimentary Wi-Fi. Our first room smelled but when we went right back to desk, they gave us a different room and it was just fine. They have a mini golf course, playground and game room... great for families!! However, we were kept waiting for 15 minutes while trying to check out because no one was at the front desk. It tastes like vending machine coffee (which, in effect, it is). The hotel also welcomes pets and has a fitness center, plus guest laundry facilities. When I told the lady we were in a rush she told me we could use the bathroom if we needed to freshen up. That reminds me of another personal preference complaint:  I got the bottled water from the soft drink vending machine, and, while that water was okay for making coffee, all of the soft drinks were Pepsi products. The facilities was good and all look very clean, except room 111, it smell like dirty feet. The one weekday I was there, the ubiquitous scrambled eggs were the only protein (albeit with shredded cheese and chunky salsa available). I don't know if it could have been fixed but the free WiFi was the only part that fell short. They also have a game room and mini golf for an additional charge. After I fell asleep I was then woken up at 1am when the guests above my room arrived. And if they happened to drop something, it would vibrate my room. I do believe the people  above us had lead in their feet. The room had an odor I can only describe as musty. Room was clean, paint was fresh but furniture a bit dated. It was an awesome staycation, great location, wonderful service and awesome staff Room was very clean, and bed was nice an comfy. _ I like that the location was not on the highway, it was just off of it. The air conditioner was very loud and make it difficult to sleep, but the room was too sticky without it on.
This hotel offers guests many amenities to make their stay enjoyable. Whether there for a business event or relaxation, The Comfort Suites West Dallas, offers something for everyone. Bed could have been a little softer but other than that the room was great. Again not sure if there were pet's previously or if there was lint, dust or some other allergen but it was bad. This hotel is super nice, located in a great place. We had a terrible experience the previous night at another hotel. This hotel is ideally located near the Dallas Convention Center and the Dallas World Aquarium. Room was very big, when we enter the AC was on to 65° with an outside temperature of 40°! Close to fast food spots, minutes away from down town Dallas, close to stores and Right by the interstate and my rate was great. However, the breakfast was limited, and the mattress was not too comfortable. I will be coming back and looking for Comfort Suites for any other trips I take in the future, thanks Ivana A fitness center, outdoor pool, and business center are among the many amenities. I was scheduled to spend my last night at another hotel elsewhere but after staying 3 nights i enjoyed it so much that i canceled my other hotel to stay there. The Comfort Suites West Dallas-Cockrell Hill is located near the Dallas Zoo. I have no problem with that if you would put it on the internet. Hotel condition is just good, location somewhat let you think about safety and not a big enough parking,very clean room it just have so many cosmetic details, beds are comfortable and the extra sofa bed a plus, breakfast very simple, the area around is good since there are a lot of restaurants in the area and stores also you have choices in case you need something, and what I am saying about the hotel location been behind a gas station whit a lot of cars in and out and peddlers around that is my concern about safety for you and your car, over all I give a 7 to this stay and the good thing for me is it was just for one night. Not sure what the issue was but within 10 mins of being in the room my husband and I had an allergy attack. Many restaurants are located close by the dining pleasure of guests. Although checkout at 11am is a little early for me. We managed to turn in the heater but the next day we could not do it. Visitors will enjoy the many things to do in Dallas, whether it is discovering new and exciting animals in the Dallas Zoo or enjoying a variety of ethnic cuisine in the city. We stayed 2 nights but they do not clean our room. Went to get in tub to find it closed asked front desk they said its seasonal. wow I really liked the breakfast I don't know what I was expecting but wow it was really good If you're not there by 5pm you're not going to find a spot. Room #322 window left open and ants were crawling in. That night the a/c activated by itself and was very noisy. Not everyone likes cheese on their eggs no gravy for the biscuits no sausage or bacon. We only booked this hotel because it had a hot. I was so surprised at the condition of this hotel. I needed a nice place to stay close to Methodist Dallas Medical Center for at least two weeks. The hotel was ok overall, convenient location 6 min away from downtown Dallas. The room I reserved is not the room I got. The hotel runs right up against the highway and you could hear traffic all night. The staff was nice, but it was midnight when we arrived and I just wanted sleep after my 9hr drive. Was good and arranged and staff are nice and cooperative. Good television channel choice selection & variety of electronics hookups. It was excellent the people were friendly and nice the room was spacious and clean. My room was 1.5 hours late and I missed first half of the celebration that I was attending. Overall, given the price, I am satisfied with the hotel. Wal-Mart across the street and lots of places to eat! Not after I book a room that I can't get my money back. Guests will enjoy the many amenities that this hotel has to offer. Elevator and balls were immaculate and felt like a brand new hotel. I prefer to stay here on every trip to Dallas. Would definitely stop there again if we passed on the way. Very quiet, air conditioner worked amazing and a quick check out by a nice front desk agent. Nice and quiet not a lot of kid traffic like some hotels Wonderful hotel, great staff, rooms were clean, BIG, comfortable beds, and clean. Slept very comfortable & the Kiddos enjoyed the place very much Little hwy noise but I was comfortable & could sleep. Each of the spacious suites accommodate free Wi-Fi, a television, comfortable beds, a refrigerator, and a microwave. Was greated by front desk guy as soon as I walked in.
The hotel feels a bit like home which is nice when you are traveling for business. I have stayed at the Zetter Townhouse as a business traveller and while on holiday with my husband. The London Stock Exchange and St. Paul’s Cathedral are less than a mile away. The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell is within one-half mile of Smithfield Market, the Museum of London, Old Bailey, and Sadler’s Wells Theatre. Rooms are quirkily decorated, as if you are staying in the home of an eccentric relative, but are comfortable and warm. Despite the small issue with the bath, it was still a great experience and would recommend The Zetter Townhouse to anyone. Reserve a table on the weekends if you want to spend time in the bar as it does get busy. The Zetter TH is cosy, warm and welcoming, full of character, more like staying in a fabulous country house hotel than in central London. Staff are friendly and efficient, keen to help out when you have questions and the cocktails were great! The townhouse contains a Games Room and a Dining Room for cocktail parties, private dinners, and other social gatherings. Set in a Georgian home in St. John’s Square, The Zetter Townhouse Clerkenwell offers boutique accommodations with a quirky British vibe. Guests are steps from the Mediaeval landmarks and modern attractions of Clerkenwell. Close to the City it is ideally placed for a work trip. We use the Zetter regularly to accommodate both our European and USA colleagues and overall it is very convenient and gives a high standard of service in all areas. Individually-decorated rooms feature a blend of bright contemporary décor and homely antique furnishings along with free Wi-Fi, flat-screen TVs, and private bathrooms with rain showers. A complimentary breakfast is served daily and room service is available 24 hours a day. Quite suitable and efficient, only had a brief overnight stay everything was quite suitable that is all I have to say The standard rooms are on the small side but this is a city hotel so not unusually so. Very hospitable and the room was wonderful, the place has charm, personality and wonderful service ... am definitely staying again. Visitors can enjoy drinks and meals in the Cocktail Lounge featuring warm styling details like a fireplace, classical art, and velvet furniture.
They had painters outside on the balcony so we couldn’t even see the ocean or open our curtains. My family and I did not have a good experience. Right after Hurricane Matthew passed over Derrick contacted me to let me know everything was fine and we could still come as planned. We enjoyed the room but, the rest of the hotel was trashy and dirty. The room was very clean when we entered and nothing was out of place. Office to check-in was hard to find as they had several signs all telling u to go somewhere different. Every time I reached out to him he would quickly respond. Sheets didn't fit on bed, but bed was super comfortable, 3/4 size fridge, actual stove. Stayed here for my anniversary....it was the perfect set up! Do not stay at sea mist hotelever  I will not ever go back to myrtle beach again  pub Daytona beach and thybee are much much better. Overall, I highly recommend this condo to anyone looking to “get away from it all” for a little while. Again, not on the room owner, and doesn’t effect my opinion of the condo, just try to be “parking-smart” when you plan your day. The Sea Must is a great family hotel close by the beach. The staff was professional and nice and went above and beyond for us. Other than that you had a great view of the ocean and the hot tub was great. We get there and the room is not what was promised had to go to 3 different buildings but the front desk people did help out and gave us ocean front like we ordered room looked clean but stove had rust all over it and so did other appliances pillow cases not changed I could tell people were loud all night and no one come to tell them please be quieter didn’t get any sleep I had paid to much for a terrible stay I will choose somewhere else next time were nice, as well as watching the brave ones enjoy the lazy river and pools:) The bed was comfortable, decent sized tv, came with a mini kitchen. The room was pretty cool but the mattress sucks, and there is no kitchen. We arrived on Friday evening and left on Sunday afternoon. Was a balcony, but even my strong husband had great difficulty getting the slider to open, door lock was broken off slider, had to lean out of railing to get view, marks all over the walls, furniture chipped and damaged, TV older than dirt! We really enjoyed it every night along with the views. First room also had the previous guests' sandal under the dresser, and their hair in the shower. The property had great views and everything that is needed for a great beach vacation stay. We got this deal because it seemed decent and wanted to give a chance to a different hotel/resort from other we have stayed. Very loud, no cold water, fridge was not cold, and asked for a trash can for 4 days before they brought one to the room.will not be staying here again. The 2nd room was better but still a lot of hair on the floors. You can drive or walk everywhere because everything was just that close. I killed two bugs that looked like cockroaches -  could have been beach bugs. If you’re in the area, I highly recommend biking Huntington Beach State Park (you can rent bikes at a great bike shop near the park: Cyclopedia), renting some jet skis and maybe going on a dolphin tour, getting a helicopter ride, swinging by Ripley’s Aquarium (if that’s your sort of thing) and walking the beach down to the pier after dark. The bed was very comfortable and even had mirrors above us ( never saw that) We will be sure to look you up next time we come down to the area I pulled all the sheets and blankets off the bed felt very uncomfortable. Yes, we read all the previous reviews but again we wanted to go with a 50/50, and since the summer season had ended we thought this would be a good way to try something new. It's nice that it a 2 minute walking distance from the beach. That small act speaks volumes.The views from the room were breathtaking. You’re better off staying down the street at the landmark. Overall the property is run down and needs an update. There was a problem with the cleaning when we got there but i sent an email and the cleaners came and took care of it. I booked for two nights and was very happy with the booking. I order 5 rooms and my last room wasn't giving to me until past 4:30pm All and all a great week and as with all hotels there can be problems but you decide on how you let them effect your time. A great place to stay....it's near all the attractions but the parking lot could be fixed. View of the ocean was great, but balcony needs painting and chairs neededa good cleaning. We would've had the lock box code if they had just answered any of our 6 phone calls and messages we sent throughout the day saying we wouldn't be there on time. The word is “mini,” and it should be present before the words “Oven” and “Refrigerator.” These are not full size appliances. The location is perfect and so close to the beach, the view is amazing. We do always enjoy ourselves here, but then I think that is because your trip is what you make of it. There were quite a few swimming pools and they were very nice and clean. I went back to their website, and those pics are probably 20+ years old. He is the most helpful of all the employees we have encountered here! it felt like we were in the middle of the ocean. We enjoyed waking up to the sunrise everyday in bed and having our morning coffee. There was a used, dirty towel under the bathroom sink with hair extensions and dye all over the towel. When in shower felt like floor under tub was going to give out, was like standing on a trampoline. They can also quench their thirst at either the cocktail bar or at the beach bar. Derrick was helpful and quick to respond to any questions we had. We stayed an extra night and had a great time. My friends and I had 2 rooms, one had new, nice comfy beds and the other had old worn out beds. The sheets felt as though they had not been washed, there was visible filth. TV had so much snow in pic couldn't watch TV (and it was a flat screen & I did check the cords were secure to cable outlet). This hotel was no doubt the nasty of all hotels I have ever stayed room was disgusting black mold , room smell like urine roaches in the room sheets appear not be clean and trim was comming away from walls and shower curtain nasty I also ask other guests bout there rooms and they too was having same problems The pools were all spread out and the water park was nasty. Very loud music and yelling going on one night so tried to call the front desk but of course no one there. I had read all the reviews for this resort and quite frankly hesitant about booking. We went out to eat, and when we came back, we saw these huge palmetto bugs on the grounds of the hotel. If you want to sleep in, the blackout curtains work really well also. Hotel at the Sea Mist was worse than a motel. I Booked this hotel because I wanted a room on the beach. If you don't get a spot in the very small parking garage, you have to park close to three blocks from the hotel. Though I was able to get in due to booking with Travelocity, other guests didn't have the same luck. Very sketchy people around the hotel and they had the ability to walk into the hotel on the beach front since there isn't any staff at that location. All the front parking was handicap so you couldn’t park anywhere to load or unload your car. We were told there was no refund, but that did not matter. They even have a free movie theater, gift shop and arcade on-site. We called Orbitz, who was wonderful in getting us moved to a better resort. The pictures are pretty deceiving of how small the room is as well. Great place to stay for a couple on a romantic getaway. Looked like some one had vomited in our bathroom and the cleaners just wiped it off the floor. - Last, but not least: If you are using the mobile app to view this property, there is a very important word that HomeAway/VRBO for some reason cuts out of the description. I messaged him a few times over the trip at varying times during the day, and he averaged a 15 minute response time. Only thing about the hot tub was that people were letting their little children swim in it and getting in with sand on them. I was not given a receipt because we booked through Expedia. The elevators took forever and there was never any parking available. Afterward, I saw a lot of really negative reviews and got nervous, but everything was perfectly fine! The keys didn't work properly had to have them changed 3 times. I noticed that when I put the toilet seat down, there was a hair on it, so the toilet had not been cleaned. I have never stayed in a hotel that had so much hair leftover from prior guests. I got to enjoy a midnight walk with my husband :) We went to our room, and found one on the wall. The photos make it look so much nicer than it is. There isn't enough parking right by the hotel but there was plenty across the street. I HAVE TRAVELED ALOT DUE TO WORK BUT NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH VIEWS FROM A RENTAL. We booked this hotel as we celebrated our wedding anniversary. The door was locked but a guy inside came out and gave us our keys. The material is coming off the wall in spots so it looks as if the walls have little holds in it. I have booked through Expedia many times snd was never denied a receipt. THE BALONY WAS EVEN TILED WHICH WAS A BIG PLUS. I'd live to do a review on my macaronikid website. In the room to plug your phone in near the bed we had to unplug the clock. The common areas are beyond belief filthy, and if we were not evacuating from the hurricane Irma, we would have walked right out. The room was nicely decorated and had nice tile floors. As far as the condition of the resort and room, not so much. First the property definitely in really bad shape, sorry but it needs a lot of work. I was afraid to take my shoes off in fear of catching something. from there wheelchair would not fit into elevator, had to actually lift wheelchair into room . You had to stand way in the corner and look out the sliding door sideways to see even a glance of the ocean. The next room was bug free but was nasty.The bed skirt was nasty looked un washed.Walls had stains .The doors had huge cracks to see outside.The ocean view was no view just hotel next door.I wouldnt give them a star.I had to stay they had my money ..I wouldnt advise any one to stay there.House keeping and staff do horrible job... Room was old , smelly, mold in the bathroom and the phone was dirty. The hotel has several buildings and the building that we stayed in had a front desk with no staff at the desk the entire time we stated there...the entrance to our building had automatic doors that opened and closed all day and night; therefore, anyone could walk in and out of the hotel at any time (weak security)...we decided to use the stairway to go down to the ground level and smelled and saw feces and trash riddled everwhere (disgusting). The hotel needs alot of updates, very old but great location We were on a family vacation and needed a place to for just the night. The pool key worked one day and the next day it would not let me into the pool building. When we checked in the hotel put us in a Basement room. I booked an all inclusive and the room we got was in one of the nasty buildings. Overall, yes there are nicer hotels in Myrtle, but you will pay a lot more to stay there. - Finding a parking spot after dark can be a tad difficult, depending on beach traffic that day. Our room was clean, elevator was clean, and the watermark was nice. I asked for an upgrade to the other nice building and pay the difference but was refused because I had booked an all inclusive. In addition to the bug, the floor was dirty, and when we checked one of the beds, we realized that we did not trust them to be clean either. Derrick answered all of our questions and the views from the room was to die for. We struggled to find a park on the street and when we could not we had to park across the street in the parking deck. It is very confusing as far as check in goes. They couldn't change our room until day 2, and even on that day it took hours of waiting to get checked into another room. I understand that this resort has other buildings and I requested to be moved to a newer, cleaner one. You normally do not see those because most hotels spray for them. All the 800 rooms feature cable TV service, microwaves, air conditioners, free toiletries, phones, fridges, in-room safes, and private bathrooms with shower/tub combinations. Everything was as described and will be our every year thing. Loved it very romantic and quite ..building could use some renovation but the room it self was amazing Selected this hotel because it accepted two dogs and it was on the beach. $3 a day for the watermark isn't terrible and you can come and go as you please. There's a number to call on the wall for any issues, but of course it was out of order. Once in the room laminated floors which were damage, smell very bad, rusted ceiling lights, kitchen dirt, and when we open the oven few roaches came out to greet us!. Cancelled the remainder of my stay with Sea Mist and rebooked with another resort. The door lock to the balcony didn't work it wiggled when opening and closing. The condition of the hotel was horrific, customer service was just as bad, but to be fair they were dealing with so many room and property complaints they may have just become numb to them all since there was nothing they could do. The hotel was decent for our 3 day stay, it was unfortunate that it rained most of the time. The elevator was immediately in front of the room so not a lot of carrying. There was a bandage in the indoor pool area that was there on the floor when we arrived, and was there when we left. We booked the unit due to the views and the jacuzzi. We had plenty of towels and the bathroom was nice and clean. The pool was cold when we first came but after talking to Jason he had someone turn up the temperature and it made our stay so much more enjoyable Jason also helped us when we first checked in and had problems with the TV. He knew that he could move us to another floor that was not having the problem. Asked for different room, CHRIS was wonderful in Customer service, he put us in a ground floor walk out to beach room. We filed a police report and a statement for the seamist resort but unfortunately they don't have any cameras in the parking deck and can't do anything. The balcony was rusty and groaned when I stepped on it. Also, the smell of marijuana was every where no one seems to care. We drove around the block several times before seeing another couple and they told where the office was. Both of the rooms had refrigerators, and one had a stove if you wanted to cook but we preferred to eat out since our stay was a short one. Got a total refund and went to stay at the Hilton. The beach was great: good sand, nice gradual slope into the ocean, and not too busy for the time of year we were there. Food near by is very good also, I'd recommend Loco Geko for sure! Typical front door but hubby had to man-handle-it to get it open and close. I think it’s incredibly important for a renter to feel in touch with, and important to, the owner. I will honestly say that the wood floor was a plus and the mattress was comfortable. Long story short, all of our items in our 2017 Camaro were stolen (even the parking pass). (And even if they were, we just went up to our room and took advantage of the Whirlpool hot tub there.) The bathroom faucet is loose and the room had not been swept. I don't think I'll rely on Expedia ratings again in the future. Because of the great customer service and great room we will be planing a return trip  Thanks so much Derrick for you professionalism during and after our stay. The rooms were great for doggies since they had no carpet. Just me and my husband a week away from the kiddos and out first time to Myrtle Beach. We would never stay at this hotel again and we lI've going to Myrtle Beach. A few things to keep in mind for your stay:   - The internet is okay, but not awesome. Just a little heads up, and more for warning not that it was a bad thing, very small frig, Microwave and toaster oven, so you likely need to plan on eating out. We arrived at 10 at night we had to go to three different places before we were able to enter the room. There is a nice building with nice clean rooms but that's not for clients who buy all inclusive. I would definitely not be bringing my children to stay at this place. The hotel has many different buildings to stay and lots of pool, including an indoor one/ hot tub. Moldy shower stall and curtains, paint falling off walls, hardest mattress I have ever slept on and my feet hung over the edge of the bed. We go to the beach every year and this has got to be the worst year yet. over $2,000 worth of valuables were taken from the trunk and the back seat (we had just left Tanger outlet mall). The room helped us relax and eased some of the tension....I want to say we will return but Myrtle Beach has definitely been scratched off of our list for vacation getaways anytime soon. I checked in and receptionist gave me wrong room so I had to go back to receptionist and say there's no room number that starts with 65503 it was 62503 the third time it worked the room was dirty sheets and never cleaned room. The employees of the resort could not answer any of your questions in order to help you. We stayed for a week mid-april, and had the time of our lives. The complex is so big and there was no sign that told you exactly where the office is. I would never recommend this hotel unless someone isn't concerned about sanitation and decent treatment by the workers. I would suggest personally requesting updated photos of the building/ room you'll be staying in if you do decide to take a chance on this place. Only had 2 small pillows on the king size bed tho and the extras in the closet were gross looking with no pillow cases. It was not an oceanview suite, and staff was literally non-existent the entire once registration was complete. I would also like to note that the staff did as much as they could, but the building was so bad I would rate it unsafe! It was too cold forthe the water park to be open but we plan to go back when its warmer because it looked so fun. I wish the staff cared a bit more, but it seems each time we go they care less and less. We even had an aboundance of towels which was more than enough for our stay. It’s part of the Sea Mist resort, which also offers a huge selection of indoor and outdoor pools as well as several jacuzzi. We didn't have to worry about other people having access to our room. It felt like springs going into my side all night pillows were completely flat. The hotel manager seemed nonplussed when several guests were complaining. This resort sits on 15 acres and features a rooftop terrace, a penthouse, 24-hour reception, free Wi-Fi, gym, seven outdoor pools, four Jacuzzis, a picnic area, and conference space. My wife and I had planned a few night getaway from the cold weather of Maine and booked this unit. It was a great place to stay I will be booking here every time I come to sc for now on my whole family loved although I wish coffee came with hotel at least they still had a store close by for convenience The first room they put us in wasn’t even the room I booked. Had to get pass code then key card for lobby doors then park 4 blocks away other than that we had a great time There was no coffee in the room and i know thats silly but why have a coffee maker and no coffee. The room was very spacious and the jacuzzi was the best feature and the thing that made up book. With all the chaos he found time to let me know all was good. Only good this was it was walking distance from the beach. Our room was a double Queen suite with kitchenette, bathroom, living room,  double Murphy bed, and balcony! The room was very nice and clean, Staff was nice overall we had a great experience! My only complaint is that the bathroom curtain needs to be replaced because of the scum build up. My husband and I had to go look for better accommodation elsewhere. The elevators smelled like smoke and weed everytime we rode them. So, when all spots were taken, I had to park across the street in the parking deck garage which is a hassle when you have two toddlers. Centrally located in Myrtle Beach, Sea Mist Oceanfront Resort Myrtle Beach is a resort offering children activity areas, water park, sauna, and is close to Family Kingdom Amusement Park. My husband booked this for me for our anniversary instead of going to Florida. I had To go back down to the Elliot Realty place to get a new pool key. Interesting places to visit in Myrtle Beach include Hudson’s Surfside Flea Market (450 metres), Cancun Lagoon Miniature Golf   (1.1 km), Bald Head Island (1.4 km), Whispering Pines Golf Course (1.1 km), and many more. Guests can take advantage of any of the five on-site restaurants serving different mouth watering dishes. We really enjoyed ourselves and loved the upgrades from renting from a private owner. The weather was rather cool for April so we stayed in and relaxed quite a bit. The bathroom door did not shut and the balcony door would not open without extreme force. I didn't even get the hotel I paid for I paid to stay in the sea mist they put!!!!! The only downside was that we could not stay longer. One plus in the room was the room has a keypad entry. The resort is within walking distance to resturaunts, mini golf and piers. My husband does carpenter work and he said he has never seen tile that style and loved it.. We will return I didn't get to check in until 6:30 pm, which was disappointing. And don't get me started on trying to check in. ME AND MY WIFE WERE CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF MARRIAGE AND THIS PLACE HIT THE SPOT. The tile and wood floor got wet as night fell from the moisture problem. We had a nice time in myrtle beach at least. I booked two nights at Sea Mist because it was affordable and right on the ocean. At one point his wife even drove down to give us something that would make our stay a little nicer. Us in a dog gone sand castle and they would not change it no matter what i tried to tell them or explain to them Arrived 8/17/17 late in the evening to find a dilapidated building (Dunes) that was surrounded by litter. The TV is very old, the tv screen had beads so the tv picture was not clear. However, the view was nice and the bathroom was clean. This is not the condo owner’s fault at all, it’s totally on the resort, just don’t expect to stream movies in HD. It is an older hotel but kept clean and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel staff was rude the room was not clean the hotel itself was not clean the amenities work clean. The room was great, offering an awesome view of the ocean, lovely decor and a cozy, yet somehow spacious, feel. Upon arriving, I noticed a layer of sand in and on my bed, even before sitting down. Also, you have access to all the pools in the Sea Mist resort system, I did not figure that out until the last day. The appliances are rusting from the moisture and very old. The front desk is clean and quiet so we thought the rest of the hotel would be the same. Then had to wait an hour for someone to come fix it. Also owner Derrick was great to deal with, very responsive to messages and sent us everything we needed to know for our stay. Hiked up to the 5th floor to find my room's floor was dirty and sand covered, a pillow on our bed was so nasty that I requested that it be thrown in the trash, the appliances were dirty and rusty and must be 30 years old! I will be staying at the Sea Mist again and will recommend this hotel to everyone! I hate to complain but this was my worse experience ever. The elevator  took forever to go up and down. We let sea mist know about this and said they would come fix it and they never did. I assume this is because they don't have the staff to make sure things are taken care of, and that is probably why the price is so low also. After the second day they moved us to a better building but honestly it wasn’t great either. We got to the place to get the keys and it was just closing. I booked an ocean view and got water park view. You can sit at the table and chairs and see the sun come up which was a huge plus. The hotel lacks ventilation, causing build up of mold and mildew. This happened on the first night of our stay and we decided to stay and make the best of it. there were holes in the wall amd the ceiling was caving in. Will never stay here and you shouldn't waste your money either. The hot tub drips all the time but, someone did come by to try and get it fixed for us. If you really have the urge to home cook something I also had to change rooms at 1am because the refrigerator was old and the gas exploted and gas was coming out the fridge and had to move my things at 1am to another room in another floor. Pleasant stay nice view from oceanfront,neighbors next to us had baby crying all night and morning not sound proof walls beside that a nice stay Durning our stay we did a lot of shopping, walking the beach and sightseeing, so to come back to the room and relax in the jacuzzi was awesome!! The staff followed by clean, fast check in and was friendly! The view from the rooms was wonderful and we could watch the waves even if it was too cold to sit on the beach. AS SOON AS WE OPENED UP THE DOOR WE WERE BLOWN AWAY BY THE SPECTACULAR VEWS COMING FROM THE ROOM. There was a few maintenence problems, like the jacuzzi never stops leaking and the light in the bathroom was more like a strobe light because It never stopped flickering. Balcony had cigarette burnt plastic furniture and dirty old turf carpeting, not to mention that the railing was wobbly and rusty! There were even stuffed animals made out of towels literally everywhere which was a surprise when opening the door. They were not helpful at all in solving your problems. THANKS DERRICK WE WILL TRY TO MAKE THIS A REGULAR VISIT But only two elevators and one was out of service and waited 10 minutes sometimes to get on the elevator. The only other outlet not behind furniture was near the coffee maker. Need to upgrade television balcony furniture and spray for bugs When we came into the room the towels were in shapes of love birds which was a nice touch.Derrick was amazing to work with. Need better wifi and do something about the floors staying soak and wet Thank you Derrick for providing such a beautiful place in the mist of all the ugliness. This meant that we could almost always find a pool that wasn’t packed with people. We got married in Feb and we decided to book a few days here for our honeymoon and I am so glad we did. The indoor pool was nice along with the hot tub. The kitchen sink was rusty and the comforters were very dirty too. There’s a Blu-ray player in the room and a Redbox 2 minutes away at the food lion (the one you can see from your room), so not really an issue. There eas a bad smell of garbage in the hallways. Instead of staying in our normal hotel, we decided to stay in a cheaper place to save money since it was only one night. It was noisy in our building, the hallways and when we walked out and about around our building. The stay was fine and the staff was good I like that they had a water park and you could go to any of the sister hotels to swim ,eat ,or even just to have a look but we had one issue the supposed ocean view wasn't ocean view unless you leaned over the balcony to see it we asked for ocean view and from the balcony we saw the hotel next door also we asked for high floor and got 2 floor we also paid extra for supposed view The first room we got the sheets were dirty as well as the room.
The Burns Fair & More Hotel in Cologne Trade Fair Centre is a hotspot in Cologne and certainly more than just a hotel. Our toilet was blocked on the first day, which we reported and we assume it was resolved whilst we were out as it was fine the next day. However, for me, the bed was way too hard and felt like I was sleeping on concrete - which has left me with a bad, painful back. When coupled with the outstanding service provided by our team, your stay will become a holiday for all the senses. All wass good except for some kids who were making loud noises until one am. Enjoyed the little welcoming gift on my pillow and had a good couple of nights sleep there. Great hotel that’s just a bit outside of the centre. Staff printed our return boarding passes for us which was most helpful. Hotel was just ok, but with all the other problems, it’s not worth it. The prominent location close to Cologne’s trade fair centre and the Lanxess Arena means it makes the ideal base for all activities in and around Cologne. Short walk to tram stop (about 5 minutes) and in a quiet location. Bathroom was very nice and wonderful shower that was always hot. No tea/coffee making facilities in rooms however free coffee is available in the reception in the morning. Also, the hotel is far out the centre and you need to get the tram to be able to get anywhere. There was no “ do not disturb” sign to hang on door. Nothing in immediate vicinity of the hotel - very residential. Much easier to get to centre of Cologne than anticipated. The Burns Fair & More is your (temporary) home away from home! Made another minor complaint which was not fully dealt with as I was told the manager was not there to authorise anything, so I am yet to email them. The hotel was great, clean and cosy and the staff were very friendly. Staff kept opening the door, even when I was in the room. With 93 rooms in a number of different categories, the Burns Fair & More has something to suit every taste. In a residential area however was close to a tram stop. It was also close to a Lidl so easy to buy supplies if necessary. With quick and convenient access to the trade fair centre, the Burns Fair & More is just the place to stay.
We put the ‘do not disturb’ sign on our door both days and both times someone went into our room and cleaned it, which I thought was strange. The hotel bar offers a wide range of drinks from beers to cocktails all served in relaxing surroundings. There are no slippers/robe or any coffee/tea in room or via room service. Quiet location, not a lot of tourists around which was kinda nice. Madrid Atocha Railway Station is a twelve-minute drive while Fundacion Lazaro Galdiano is a seven-minute walk. Definitely this was a 2 star Hostel not a 4 star Hotel. The Hollywood-themed rooms at this hotel feature amenities such as a private bathroom, flat-screen TV, hair dryer, in-room laptop safe, minibar, and desk. Overall, hotel is very good, staff is not overly friendly but professional and efficient. The theme of Hotel is really nice and unique, its really clean and tidy. There was 1 little bottle of shampoo, 1 little bottle of liquid soap and 1 soap. The breakfast that was included is no more than standard and the staff is more occupied talking to each other than attending the clients. They paintings/ artsy look and character of hotel very nice. The hotel restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and specialises in Mediterranean cuisine. This modern hotel features rooms that have been individually decorated by artists and offers free Wi-Fi access throughout. The room also didn’t seem like it had air conditioning? An advice for Expedia managers: Please confirm with someone of your trust the category of the Hotels. This is more a trick than a concept because is strictly decorative and no more. The entrance has three high steps and there’s nobody there to help you to lift the baggage. Dormirdcine is just a ten-minute taxi ride from Santiago Bernabéu Stadium with El Retiro Park just twelve minutes away. Amenities at this central hotel include a 24-hour front desk, luggage storage, laundry facilities, multilingual staff, tours/ticket assistance, and a meeting room. It got pretty hot in there when the sun was shining through and the thermostat only had one option on it: heat. Its location seems a bit off the beaten track if you're looking to visit the main tourist attractions. The hotel is charming, but unfortunately a lot of rooms have no view and facing a wall! Towels were very worn out, the bed linens smelled very bad, the reception never answered, there is no iron in the room. If it rains, it smells, because of pipes issue or any other issue, smellin my room, made me to change my room a few times. The rooms were clean,modern and comfortable and although its quite a distance from Madrid centre we enjoyed the walk. This hotel is overpriced for the services and standard that I experienced. Restaurant was closed due to Easter holiday, which was not a problem for me as there was other restaurants in the area. The hotel cleanliness is low, the bathroom did not have the layout of typical hotel. Dormirdcine is a unique four-star hotel in the heart of Madrid. The hotel decor is fun, rooms are very clean, restaurant a little pricey. Adequate sized room with a very comfortable bed and soft pillows. The room was to small, the bed is small also.
Great hostel, full of character! Friendly and helpful staff, great deal on dinner at the attached restaurant. Super convenient to visiting the Sol district and the palace and cathedral on foot or by train. Room spacious and bright, great facilities, our only objection that the double bed was actually two singles pushed together - not very conducive to snuggling up in bed! One tip - skip the 2€ breakfast deal unless you just want an easy meal; the breakfast was plentiful but pretty average compared with the amazing food to be found all over Madrid. We stayed a few days at this place and tried both, a private room and a 4-bed room. Location is central and the staff are just wonderful. The only negative is the noise from the street below...which was fixed with a pair of Earplugs :) Highly recommend it. Great value for money, this centrally located Hostel is one to look out for. Location, location and location. We were given a map with complete infor of the attractions as well as the route to go about. we covered everything in 2 days. With family of 5, we were given a private room consists of 3 bunk bed. private and just enough as we only needed a place to rest. 24 hours front desk with helpful and cheerful staffs. The hostel is clean and near the centre of the city. The rooms are small. Our room was directly over an open area over the bar. The a/c didn't work, so we had to have the windows open. The bar closed at 2AM, with the last patrons only leaving g by 2:30. Not much sleep that night. Room 007 Ventura Hostel was a pleasant experience. Clean rooms and close to all of the major attractions. This place is amazing. It simple, affordable but extremely clean, fun and welcoming. We shared a 4-people room with my husband and our kids ages 3 and 5, and it was great. The place is in a very central location, 5-10 minute walk to Prado museum, 5 minutes to Sole, and 10-15 to the Royal Palace - can't get better than that. There is a great restaurant on the premises.
The first morning we woke up, we saw cockroaches roaming all around. 7-8 of them were around the kitchen, 1 was next to our son`s bed and 1 was in the bathroom. We killed them all and spoke to reception about the issue. She told she would spray the room when we were away and we left the room to go to Movieworld. This was a huge mistake. We should have packed all our stuff and left the place straightaway. When we returned in the evening we saw 2 more cockroaches roaming around. It was 9 pm and the reception was closed. I went to the IGA to buy an insect killer to kill the cockroaches and we couldn`t sleep all night being surrounded by these disgusting bugs. Next morning we spoke to the reception lady showed her the dead bugs and asked for a refund for our remaining night as we couldn`t stay in a place like this one. She told us that owner would come around 9 am and we should have spoken to the owner. There was another guy at the reception who rejected our refund request. Normally you expect people to apologize and refund you straightaway in a situation like this but they just offered me to pest control. They should have done it before we stayed there. I have never seen a cockroach in any other hotels i stayed in my life and we had too many of them in this room. We called Expedia and they helped us to refund and they also told us the owners still declined to refund and expedia would be refunding us directly. We left the hotel and moved to another nearby hotel. Dishes from previous guests put back in cupboard dirty. We had cackroaches running across the floor, the couch was in disgraceful condition with a cover that didn’t fit thrown over it to hide the peeling vinyl. Previous guests food scraps under the bin liner and their leftover food in the cupboards and filthy curtains. We didn’t expect much for the price, but was way worse than we expected. Just a little bit of money spent on a tidy up would make a world of difference with this place and the cleaning staff checking the cupboards and crockery for cleanliness. However linen was very clean although the top of the main bed  and the pillows were constantly very damp like water was leaking on it from somewhere. Looking into other rooms we obviously got one of the worst as some were a little less grotty. But location was perfect and quiet, so 10/10 for that. Would stay again in a better room, but definitely never in the one we had. Low key hotel, most likely has nothing to do with Holiday Inn, no logo of Holiday Inn anywhere. Very very old outdated facility and rooms and furniture and appliances. Dirty sofa and floor. Pool was not functional for two days for maintenance issues. Front desk/Reception closes on Stat holidays nad open from 9 to 5 only! They ask you to dispose your garbage at the end of stay. Building, room, and garage door open with a key, literally a key to open the garage door to the underground parking! You feel that you are living the 60's in this hotel. Location....AMAZING...close to everything on foot and close to the main beach of Surfer's Paradise. close to main city and beach...but the hotel is not in good condition...table lamp was not working....pots burnt...fridge wasnt working....had to throw all my foods....no servicing and had to wash all linens and towels.....just convinent thats it.... Perfect if you want to be close to everything. Apartment was spacious and well equipped but run down. Nice pool and bbq area and very friendly and helpful staff. Rookie start as we arrived at the hotel on Sun 5pm which is outside their normal office hours   and there wasnt clear instruction on how to contact staff....lucky that there was a guy there who knew how to contact staff so we were able to get out key After hours check in was easy. Free carparking. Easy access, plenty of space, friendly staff, nice and clean, nice balcony, pool and spa was great! Fantastic kitchen and laundry facilities, very comfy beds. Shower head could probably do with replacing but everything else was perfect! We stayed here for 4 days with our 3 children and from start to finish was such amazing customer service always helping with anything we needed and went that extra mile to make us happy. The pool and spa was a hit for the kids they loved it. Really good location 2 streets from Cavill ave. our 2 bedroom apartment was clean, spacious and very kid friendly. Thanks for the stay will definitely be back. Great location needs some updating which is getting done our 2nd time staying there would stay a 3rd Loved the location of hotel. it was so close to beach , restaurants and shopping malls , we walked every evening. Kids enjoyed in swim pool. Thumbs Up !! ! Good value for money. Rooms are bit old and needs some work. Bed could be more comfortable. But overall good. Everything was nice, quite a simple set up but has a pool, spa and the beach is about 40metres away. The floor carpet is a bit dusty. Would suggest hotel Management to remove the carpet.the Space and facilities is good. Carpeting and sofa need to be cleaned or just remove permanently. Close to beach is good.Air conditioner  dont work real good.had bed bugs in our bed daughter got bitten aswell.got parking fine out front while checking in and told the lady on management that she should warn customers to park in drive way, straight away she became smart to me said not my problem and begain swearing at me and smashed the phone on table. Disgusting service. the pictures online do not adequately represent the room or facilities available. The unit itself had the facilities to accommodate us for a week but the crockery etc was limited and in some instances dirty. We arrived to a dead cockroach on the lounge carpet and a stale odour (rectified only by running of air con and opening of windows for 24hrs) . The first day that we entered the room smelled very awful and there were dirt on the dining table. The Stove was not working. we asked the staff to fix it, they said OK, but nothing happened. We left the accommodation one day earlier as we were not happy with the cleanliness of the room. Many items were faulty but couldn't get help because the staff locked up the reception after I checked in round 5pm. The aircon was faulty, problems with the TV etc My partner and I arrived at 5pm on a Saturday reception was closed. Room was filthy appeared unvacuumed, spilt milk and cereal on dining table and chairs, mouldy bathroom and hair everywhere. No hot water for showers! After speaking with staff the following morning and requesting a refund for our second nights stay we were offerred a cleaning service but no refund. It is extremely poor after paying $260 that we did not have hot water. Had to pay for a room at another hotel to ensure we could shower and enjoy our night! You also have to pay for accessories like toilet paper if you use more than one roll Can't imagine that there was only one piece of flat sheet and the resident needed to put the blanket on top of the flat sheet. There were 3 issues :  - cleanliness of the blanket - if the tenant has respiratory allergy , that would be a big issue - during night time, the outside temperature was below 10 degrees centigrade, there were only two pieces of thin blanket. One point worth giving a Like was that the shower was very good. The reception staff was nice. What a fantastic location, and wonderful unit! We had a fabulous time! There was some confusion in our booking, however Kai went out of his way to get things sorted and made arrangements for us at Beachcomber. Really appreciate Kai's enthusaiasm  and dedication to customer service. THANK YOU KAI for making our stay and Holiday in Gold Coast memorable. Tricketts  is well located and close to all facilities,including local shops and cafes. The reception staff were efficient and very helpful. Our unit was spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable. We estimate that Tricketts was built in the 1970's.and is showing its age. The upright stove needs to be replaced. Some maintenance needs to be done in the bathroom The toilet was leaking badly, the laundry tap dripped the shower was very old and a bit mouldy. We told the manager I'm sure he still hasn't done anything about it. Location is fantastic Friendly staff, the apartment had everything a family of 5 needed with 1 queen bed, bunks and a single bed. Close to shops and the beach. We will definitely be staying here again We had an awesome stay and the location was the best. The staff was wonderful and very helpful! The hotel is in the best location! :) close to everything! Rooms were a great size, only Downfall was the bed was not comfortable :( Room was comfortable and clean. Common areas could do with a tidy up. Location was fantastic! Overall very satisfied. Hotel was right smack in the middle of Surfers within a short walk to the beach. Free parking too. Its not a lavish hotel but rooms were adequately stocked, a great size and more than did the job. I feel the average/bad reviews are unjustified. We stay at 5 star hotels fairly regularly and this hotel is fine for a few nights. Would def stay again at the right price. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment, which was a good size for families. But the apartment itself was very disappointing. Upon entering the room it was very stale & smelled of cigarettes. The screen sliding door to our balcony was not even on its rails. Bathroom needs a desperate revamp, mouldy shower & a lot of water damage to bottom of doors & cupboards. 1 roll of toilet paper for 4 people for 3days. Very noisey at night, our room backed onto the Mantras pool area & there were loud swearing & screaming coming from there till late at night, could be helped a little with better windows as the ones in bedrooms may aswell be open as they block out nothing. All in all if you need cheap accomadation dont mind uncomfortable beds & noise then go for it otherwise i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone. We were fooled by the reviews it was a good experience because when we first arrived it was easy to park our car because of the great car park. when we walked into our room it was very nice and throughout our stay we have had a great experience the room was comfortable and another good experience was the kids had fun with other kids because of the great pool/spa facilities. and we had a great night experience because we were able to enjoy our room and at the hotel we feel really safe. The unit itself was spacious, clean and well equipped, close to everything you could possibly want at Surfers Paradise. Unfortunately we got about 2 minutes of hot water for 4 people - we had to boil the kettle just to wash the dishes up. Unfortunately the hotel was unable to offer any sort of solution except wait for it to get hot again - so the following morning we got a second lot of 2 minutes of hot water to shower. For the price we paid for the room I would except as a minimum that everyone could have a shower. It has a great location.close to everything in Gold Coast . The unit has a good size. The price was very good . The apartment was very clean. Metres was really comfortable. Unit has all wat we needed Neat and clean. Near Surfers Paradise and beach promenade. Staff helpful. Spacious unit great for a budget family stay as everything provided  Beds were hard so we both woke up stiff each day so ok if you like sleeping on floor like surfaces Also kids in pool so loud had to close door to hear  tv but stopped by 9pm and not too early in day Something wrong with clothes dryer but still positives outweighed negatives Room floor dirty, toilet leaking, broken sofa, broken cupboards, broken balcony door, room smells bad, no bathroom soap etc,  Lights in bathroom not working. Etc etc Good place. Close to beach and shopping. My children love the swimming pool. It's a bit old but it's ok. Old and dated but clean and comfortable good undercover parking nice pool big room and the location-perfect easy stroll to the beach and centre of surfers The location is great but it appears not all the rooms are up to the same standard. So I'd consider other options before this but if you do want to be only a few minutes walk from cavil ave and don't want to spend lots of money then this might be Okay for you. Cannot believe had to rubbish out of room and wash used dishes ?? ? Never stayed here before and would certainly return. Friendly staff,very close to the beach and clean hotel and recomended to everyone and we ll be back for sure Furniture and fixtures,e.g. lounge suit and curtains needs updating so that the place looks more cosy and modern It was very comfortable feeling. Like home even when away from home. Very close to the beach and main strip at surfers This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this hotel. Its close to everything so no need to drive once checked in. Rooms are big enough. Beds comfortable and fresh. We'll definitely stay here again. Paid for a hotel for 6 the last bed was a pull out couch as hard as boards. Not comfortable at all. The bunk looked liked it would collapse if someone slept on top of it. Mtge hot water system was so small I had to shower my kids all at different times of the day or it would be cold. Not a nice stay for us at all. This place has everything you need and the location is amazing we enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable . Been here before and we were very happy with our room. This time our room was not good at all. Torn carpet, kitchen drawers that wouldn't shut properly, cutlery and crockery that were plastic, chipped and not enough of it. Great place to stay, close to everything , handy to have a kitchen as the supermarket is 5 mins away. There is a free shuttle to harbour town   Market on the esplanade is a 2 min walk  Restaurants handy. Good central location. Easy walking distance to the beach and stores.
The service staff were warm and polite. The onsen facility and its surroundings were quite clean. However, was a little disappointed that dinner wasn't provided on the first night we arrived. We assumed that for the price we were paying (22,500 yen/night), it would be provided for in the package. When we tried to order dinner, we were told that it would cost an additional 6000 yen per person. To make matters worse, all the restaurants and dining places nearby were already closed (~6pm) and we had to settle for snacks from the nearby convenience stores. Cute little traditional motel in the heart of Hakone Lake! i liked the traditional Japanese breakfast, the outdoor hot spring is small but nice and clean. Good location, 1 min walk from bus station. however the facility itself is a bit outdated. My brother and I were only there for one night, they reception were super welcoming, they have both indoor and outdoor hot spring, it is very clean and tidy, the overall staying is very nice and warm.
Terrible. Rude staff. Mold on the toasts at their so-called continental breakfast. Rooms extremely small without coffee makers or any facility. One tea and coffee maker downstairs but each time you want a cup, you have to ask for it at the front desk. No lobby. The only plus:  wifi was working well and nieghborhood is great - tons of restaurants, convenient stores etc at 2mn walk -. It is a hotel to avoid at all costs even if you are on a budget. Located about 5 minutes from Bayswater tube station down a quiet street, the Hotel has a very pleasant Reception area and the check in was absolutely fine. There is a lift and our room was on the 3rd floor. Room 330 had a view over the neighboring gardens of private houses in the street behind. The room was fine - bed, wardrobe and bedside tables, with a hairdryer and blanket in the wardrobe. There were only 3 hangers! A few more of those would be handy. The bathroom was in a cupboard at the foot of the bed and the door only opened a foot before it met the bottom of the bed and couldn't open any further! The bathroom was completely molded in cream plastic and had a toilet, sink and shower cubicle - very compact and bijou but it did the job. There were complimentary shower gels and shampoos. The shower wasn't very powerful but that was probably just as well as I was worried it might flood the bathroom floor! The bed was very comfortable and there was a fan to keep us cool. We slept with the window open to keep the room as cool as possible in the July heat. Foxes kept me awake but not for long. Breakfast was in the basement and was toast and coffee/tea with fruit juices/yogurts and fruit available for self service. Quite minimal but completely sufficient to start the day. Overall we were pleased with our stay - the only downside was the tiny bathroom, but it wouldn't stop me from staying again. The staff were all pleasant and the room clean and comfortable. The hotel is within a short walk of Bayswater tube station and the circle line. There are a number of restaurants along this walk, ranging from chains to independent (I tried the Moroccan cafe, which was very good). Reception and the rooms are a little tired, but clean and tidy. Breakfast was served in the basement area. Not the most exciting continental breakfast (processed cheese slices, hard boiled eggs, toast, jam, marmalade, cheap watery yogurt, , UHT juices, apples and bananas and coffee/tea) but served promptly and efficiently by friendly kitchen staff. I was staying for one night as I was attending a concert. For this type of stay the hotel was serviceable. Great hotel in top location off the main drag. We stayed Saturday night and didn’t hear anything from the streets after 11.30. Room was small but very clean. Good WiFi.we were served by two different reception staff - both who were polite and friendly. The one let down for us was the breakfast arrangement and the breakfast host. It was boiling hot and In our view the room was too small to cater for the number of guests and the host was in dire need of some customer service training. A smile, a verbal acknowledgement, ensuring there was milk on the table, that the tables were kept cleared, and offering more coffee would have made a difference to the somewhat soulless experience it was. Nevertheless we got this hotel for a great price and overall it didn’t disappoint. Would definitely stay here again Very small rooms, no facilities in the rooms, other facilities which we take for granted , basics like tea and coffee facilities were unavailable in the rooms, these facilities were available in the lobby only. Very rude and unhelpful staff. Breakfast was most unimaginative Close to the Underground and a stones throw from Hyde Park. The room I had was very reasonable for one person at such a cheap price. It is hardly luxury and I wouldn't use it for my wedding anniversary but for one person on a business trip, it met all my expectations. Got a nice deal, it was clean, decent breakfast, and fantastic location The location is excellent but the room is too small and not clean. Went for a concert, ticket was to be delivered to hotel and signed by desk, they were excellent at helping me receive ticket via Mail Quiet area of Kensington close to restaurants etc. Clean and comfortable. Very happy with it. it is unbelievable that there is still a beautiful hotel on the outside and inside so old and old-fashioned, even without an individual bathroom, as we were living 100 years before . It does not look clean I would never Came back! This hotel was ideal for a short work trip to London. The position is great, close to transport but in a relatively quiet street. The single room was clean and had enough space, everything looked new and in good condition. The staff were friendly and overall there was a nice atmosphere. Overall, a good place to stay for the price and better value than a lot of competitors. We stayed in a quadruple room. Really clean. Staff nice and friendly. The only thing the breakfast is continental, not English breakfast. A bit disappointing as no pastries available. Just toasts. It would be nice to have some croissants. The hotel is in a great location ideal for what we needed.The check in was fast and efficient no problems at all, the receptinist was very friendly. Our room was on the first floor and we were very impressed with how modern and clean it was, it felt that it had recently been refurbished and was very comforatable. The hotel is excellent value for money and continental breakfast was included, the breakfast area was a little small but you cant have everything for the price we paid.Will definately consider staying at the hotel again when visiting London. Welcome, helpful, friendly first impression from reception and on departure. Room small but was a single. Filthy walls need painting and carpet replaced. The shower was new but no place to put soap or shampoo while showering. For what I paid the room was adequate but an insult to put a guest into considering the filthy walls and stained carpet. The bed could also do with replacing. As a solo traveller it seems a lot of hotels don't care where they put you! Noisy into the early hours with banging doors and general banging around but given the location I wasn't surprised and didn't bother me too much. There are always ear plugs! I would probably give this hotel a second chance and stay here again. Charged me £90 for a cancelled reservation that was done well before the prescribed time, almost 7 hours before the cutoff time. I have stayed in this hote for more than 2 weeks collectively and did not expect this. When I tried contacting again and again the Garden court hotel and hotels.com kept blaming each other. Who's loss is ultimately, mine!!! Sorry did not expect this. Great stay really comfortable and clean continental breakfast wasn't what we were expecting though! Hey, great price, quiet street, near multiple tube lines and restaurants. I think it met my expectations for a budget friendly safe hotel with breakfast included and a shower in the bedroom. If you want the ritz, pay for the ritz. I loved my room. I didn't spend much time there but the time I was in my room it was enjoyable. They seem  be going through a refurb. I got a warm welcome and everything was satisfactory. I'll come again. Very handy for business and short taxi ride from my Christmas do. Only down side room was too hot. Great location, walking distance to Kensington palace and Hyde Park. Good transport links nearby. Hotel room was clean and tidy. Only downfall I would say is the breakfast. Excepting a full English but instead was given hard boiled eggs, toast, or cereal. Can’t moan as it was great location for the price. This was a very good straightforward over night stay with a friendly welcome. Convenient and good value although due to having to leave by 08.00in order to make a business appointment, breakfast was a bit rushed. We had an excellent stay. Room had been recently refurbished and looked good with lovely view to the Square. Shower and toilet compact and very clean. Complimentary continental breakfast. Close to two tube stations. Easy reach of Kensington Palace, High Street Kensington and Notting Hill. We have stayed at a few other hotels in Kensington Gardens Square and this is by far the best value hotel. Great location,  very clean, excellent value, issues with Wi-Fi in room but the staff did try to assist. We would stay here again.
Small but very clean rooms, very quite,  Helpful staff, pleasant stay Very helpfull stuff.comfortable bed and pillow.very close to effel tower. Hotel is a short walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. Nothing fancy if you just want a place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. We had a good rapport with the staff. They were friendly and helpful. Check in and out very easy. They called a cab when I needed one. I walked to a nice Italian restaurant/bar down the block. Nice hotel on a quiet street very close to the Eiffel Tower. The hotel standard is generally good for small money. Close to the metro, grocery store and restaurants. Can’t stay at the smallest room very pathatic room & service. Bad experience ever Was amazing. Staff were great, room was clean. The building is an old build and cleanliness is Zero! The receptionist isnt helpful at all! Rooms are too small and everything sucks other than the location. it was very close to the Eiffel Tower, which we loved! I am guessing we are accustomed to hotels in America because this was literally the smallest hotel room I've ever been in. it also had no air conditioning, making it very hard to sleep. the shower was 2x1 feet and if I turned the wrong way, I could turn the water off! the hotel staff was relatively nice and spoke enough English to get me my room key. the elevator only held me and my suitcase. It is also inconvenient that the rooms are not ready until the middle of the afternoon (we had been traveling for 12 hours and wanted to change but couldn't). finally, all we heard all night were very loud bumps and doors slamming...the walls were very thin and it woke me up several times. Very convenient to stay in this hotel.Metro  is two minutes and you can walk to the interesting historic points Smile restaurants everywhere and food is cheap. You have to pay for breakfast, but it's worth it  I have good experience with staying in this hotel
Hotel was wonderful. Large parking lot. Close enough to San Francisco without actually being in San Francisco. Great shopping and food walking distance around hotel. If you have more than one room and are parking, double check your parking receipt before checking out. I checked in two rooms, and paid for parking; but when I checked out luckily the guy doing the checkout for me mentioned there was a parking charge for both rooms. I only parked one vehicle. Stayed in room 521, which is facing the Emeryville train station. I was up the whole night due to the loud noises. I don't recommend this hotel despite its high rating. I called 2 times for clean coffee cups since I didn't want to disturb for room cleaning When I said this is the second time I am requesting  It seems like she didn't care SHAKILA WAS GRAET Convenient location for my needs. Moderately priced with an excellent value. Rooms included a white noise machine which I enjoyed immensely. Setting included Rain, White Noise, Thunder, Waves, and Water. Comfortable bed! Nice hotel close to shopping center, restaurants, movie theater and freeways. Easy/plenty of parking, clean facilities, large rooms, great breakfast for hotel guests. Hotel pool was under construction, which was a bummer but understandable. The hotel staff were great, especially housekeeping. They went above and beyond for us. Good stay I would stay there again. It was a bit pricey. I received a room upgrade without requesting it. Probably the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The restaurant seemed plain, but the food was better than I would have expected, based on the decor of the room. All staff were helpful and pleasant. This worked great. Got off the train and walked to our room. Nothing but good things to say from staff to hotel room!! ! Great location. We literary got off the train and walked to our room.. From the pictures posted online the room seemed a lot different. It was too basic for the $178+ I paid for It was nice , despite the complaints about noise , for us it was peaceful and pleasant night Very nice for the price.... Very,Very pleased............................ Everything was nice except parking was pretty crowded. Really enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was good. Rooms were clean and nicely put together. Not thrilled with the train being so close but it didn't keep me up. were there to attend baseball game enjoyed the shopping nearby Room was clean and spacious. Very comfortable beds and pillows. The complementary breakfast wa also a plus. Would stay here again. I really liked the Hyatt House. It was my first time in Emeryville/San Francisco Bay Area, and I'm glad I came across this hotel. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff was always helpful. The breakfast was pretty good and they had quite a variety of food each morning which is always a plus. I would definitely recommend this hotel! LOVED our stay here. I would do it again in a hot minute. Booked online the morning of our stay, which really was a sort of a staycation. Emeryville is a great place to stay near SF. We live in the North Bay and it worked out for us to have an IKEA (just down the road) visit, stay over and then launch into SF from the hotel. Breakfast (NICE spread) was included and the staff was SO helpful and friendly. If had booked to stay longer we would definitely have used the well-stocked kitchen to cook meals. We only stayed one night so didn't need the kitchen. We had a King suite, which comfortably housed 2 teenage girls (sofa bed) and 2 adults. There is a pool and hot tub, which the teens used. I highly recommend this hotel. I went to Emeryville for some R & R. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable but wish the room was more spacious. The breakfast was just ok. This is a good hotel for a family of 4 to stay in. The hotel is located just outside San Francisco. We booked a one bedroom suite which suited our family quite comfortably. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The breakfast provided was quite nice and very filling. Just wished the pool was heated in spring. It’s was way too cold for my kids to enjoy. First time at Hyatt Emeryville — friendly and knowledgeable staff. We stayed for one night in Oakland. The noise level wasn’t too bad from the traffic and we got a pretty nice view all things considered. The service there was nice, everyone was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was nice but the lines get really big around 8:30. I would recommend someone stay here for sure. It was definitely a nice hotel and stay facility is neat and clean. good location. public transportation nearby. bay view was excellent from 10th floor This hotel seems to be geared towards customers who are planning on staying multiple days. I enjoyed the extra room in our double queen size area with the added kitchen and living area. The other reviews are right in that the train will definitely wake you up at 8 o’clock in the morning! We switched hotels from the Hilton garden to this one because the beds actually hurt our backs. The Hyatt has very comfortable beds. This was our first time staying here and the hotel rocked. The staff was friendly, the entire facility was immaculate, and the room was awesome. It was a bit small, but comfortable, nonetheless. The shower was perfect and even included a floor mat! The only change I would make is to reduce the room rate as the rate is a bit pricey. Parking was a breeze, even though it was an additional cost. However, the Travelocity member discount I used help to offset the rate a bit. Overall, I love this hotel and will definitely be back! Highly recommended! I loved the hotel, the room and the breakfast! We had a great stay and it worked well within our budget. I loved that the parking was free. my group had two rooms and the staff could not have been more wonderful. the rooms were very clean, well appointed, very roomy. the facilities were excellent and the breakfast each morning was wonderful! Parking was included and they had lots of it. this hotel is very close to shopping and restaurants too. we had absolutely NO complaints at all! Great place for our family of six to stay on vacation. Easy to get to downtown San Francisco with public transportation. Full breakfast buffet was great, kids enjoyed the heated pool, and it was convenient to have the kitchen in our room. Great hotel. Very clean. Good hot and cold breakfast. Decent laundry facility. Close to shopping and restaurants. Close to baseball and basketball stadiums. Nice to stay out of the big city but plan on it taking a while to cross the bay. Would definitely stay here again. Best part of the hotel was breakfast. It was very good everything was clean and organized. The hotel and room were very nice, and the clerks were friendly. However - our room was right next to the train station and trains go by honking and screeching loudly all night! They even put ear plugs in your room. I am a pretty sound sleeper but I had two terrible nights of sleep because of the trains, so I wouldn't stay here again. Too bad because I liked the room itself, which was spacious and clean. Clean, comfortable room. Plenty of space for families to spread out. Really good breakfast with omelette station. Staff was friendly and courteous. Excellent choice. Rooms are wonderful. Bay view was incredible. Very pleasent experience Small walk to shopping mall and few minutes drive to most of the attractions This Hyatt is CLEAN,CONVENIENT and has a great. Continental breakfast is very good. I HIGHLY recommend it. AAA++ Fantastic hotel - beautiful co fiction. We stayed there because we could get a one bedroom suite for the same price as a studio in San Francisco. Parking was very reasonable so with a car we were able to get back into San Fran whenever we wanted. Staff so great. The staff was super friendly and very catering to children. The room was nice and clean. Breakfast was by far one of the best complimentary breakfasts I have ever had. My daughter left her retainer in a napkin on the table and a couple of minutes after leaving we returned to ask if we could dig through the trash and find it. The wait & kitchen staff sorted through the trash for us and found it! Such a relief and staff going above and beyond. Thank you!! ! The facilities were nice, but the hotel management and maintenance of the building were horrible. When I arrived they put me in a room on the 8th floor, I carried a bunch of stuff up the room and when I got there one of the maids stopped me from entering and started talking to me like a was a small child and told me I could not go in. I had to carry all my stuff back down to the front desk and was told the room was not ready (check-in is at 3:00pm and it was after 4:00pm). I was then given a room on the 9th floor. Again, I carried all my stuff up. Upon entering my second room I found that it contained a kitchen (ALL the rooms contain kitchens according to the hotel staff) with an extremely noisy refrigerator. Again, I carried all my stuff downstairs to the front desk. I spoke with the hotel manager, a woman who appeared befuddled and non-functioning, and was given another room in the 12th floor. I found out later that the room had almost no water pressure, so doing things like brushing your teeth, washing your face, and showering became very laborious tasks. I later asked the same manager where the gym was and she stated is was just down a hall and to the left. After spending about 15 minutes looking for the gym (the manager could not give accurate directions), I found that it was actually outside of the hotel in a separate building. You have to walk out in the pool area, and the hotel turns off ALL the lights in the pool area at night, so finding the gym can be a hazardous. Nice hotel with everything that I need: free parking, free breakfast, nice kitchen, convenient location to freeway and shopping......I can not ask for more Exceptional hotel, very very comfortable, quiet, excellent view to the Bay Bridge, very clean, close to shopping areas and eateries, will visit again. Comfortable, welcoming hotel, short walk from train station. Stayed in a suite with partial view of bay. Two queen beds in bedroom, slightly sift mattress in Sudanese in living room. Roomy bathroom. Good free buffet breakfast included with room. My experience was very much enjoyable. The hotel room was very spacious and comfortable. The room was exactly what we were looking for. Big enough for 2 adults and 2 kids to run around. Really nice, super clean, convenient hotel. Great breakfast. Bay view room view not so great (maybe list as partial bay view for lower floors). No early morning coffee available except in room. Comfy bed with nice selection of pillows. Great stay. Breakfast was nice and location convienient. My stay at the Hyatt House was a very pleasant, enjoyable & relaxing experience. The only problem I encountered was the television in the living room did not work properly. It kept loosing the signal. Otherwise,  everything was excellent. Decent except thin walls and doors (think cheap closet/bedroom doors) made sleeping all but impossible. Noise from train was an issue well. Home away. Spacious room, full kitchen, loved stay there Excellent location and amenities with this location. Phenomenal experience from the breakfast buffet to the friendly staff! Best hotel I've stayed at in all my years. The breakfast buffet was great and comes with an omelette bar! Everything was very fresh and is not the bagel with cream cheese you usually get when breakfast is included. Rooms were posh and super clean! Loved having a fully equipped kitchen as well. Will def stay again if I'm ever in the area. Close to OAK airport Had a business trip and needed a place to resemble a home stay. I reserved a suite with a kitchen and it was a perfect place to work and unwind. Great location easy access to the Bay Bridge to commute to SF meetings, while allowing me to stay a pedestrian when I return from the office. We enjoy staying at Hyatt House places and this one in San Francisco was great Did not have roll in shower that i booked. No views,  no atms, Check in was fast and the staff was very welcoming. Room was big and very clean! Beds were comfortable. I will definitely be staying here again whenever I come back to the Oakland area. Good in and out for families. Great free parking.
Took 3 days for clearing lady to take away used glases. Halfempty minibar that never was refilled. Strange and not very friendly questions in the restaurant. Not very good dinners. We left early in the morning and got such a lousy breakfast package;old dry bread, green bananas. Hotel had a pooltable which wasnt for free. No weather forecast from the slopes only for the village. The weather forecast that u got in the evening was for the past days not coming days....then ut is not a forecast just a resumé Of the day. I expect A LOT more from a 4 star hotell. Great hotel, friendly people.Kirchberg is a great place for winter or summer.
Take some extra water bottals with you if you dont want to pay extra. They charge for parking to. Oterwise love the room and beautiful view I enjoyed my 3 day stay, staff is great, restaurant is great, room is clean and comfortable  My only problem was my room 504 was next 2 rooms being maintained and noise and knocking went till 10;00 pm and that was disappointing Hotel had friendly staff, clean facilities, a well equipped fitness center and a heated pool. the restaurant breakfast options were excellent and unexpectedly affordable. Excellent property if you need to be in the Surrey area. Only problem was the weight of the bedding - far too heavy Nice place to stay for a night. Clean, comfortable and quiet. Great experience and very clean, love the club level! It was nice to stay in a clean and well groom ed room.. The aroma was really nice aswell as the staff Surprised by the interior, very modern and up to date. Staff was very friendly and super helpful! The lady who checked us in was extremely rude. The hotel is very nice and clean. Great hotel close to our destination in Guildford. Would stay again in all our visits providing rooms are available. very comfortable mattress,efficient at the front desk Very clean and professional services really nice perfect place to say for vacation Outstanding hotel ... recommend 100% ... Excellent Staff were friendly. Room clean and comfortable. Restaurant food was good. Room service food mediocre at best. You have to pay to park at the hotel. Elevators very slow. All in all a good quality hotel. The room, space, ambiance and environment were great as usual. Not sure what changed but breakfast no longer seems to be included (was during last stay) and secured parking seems to be getting ever more expensive. Comfortable beds and free internet. Pool is outdoor and pool area was messy. Friendly, efficient hotel staff. Very clean, modern, beautiful room. Super comfortable bed and bedding. Had Saturday brunch and the food was delicious and servers so friendly, Also, located close to many shopping and dining amenities. Will definitely be returning. The bar is warm and friendly with great staff. The Valet parking is a great service Great place with everything you need at an excellent price Hotel is really nice pool and hot tub are outside on a nice deck area. Food at the restaurant is good but the service at the restaurant is lacking Staff was excellent especially Grechen Everyone in our party loved this hotel. very comfortable hotel in all aspects. Great hotel with excellent service and fabulously comfy beds. And the location is super handy. Continued years of construction wear on you as a guest. The noises are annoying at best. In addition, one of the main elevators was malfunctioning and buzzed outside our room all night long. Add in the hefty charge for parking, and I think next time we'll be staying at the hotel across the street. Covenient location for my needs Good price, good location, and friendly staff Nothing wrong with the hotel A bit plain, room is decorated in grey and no coffee in the room  Most of the lights work and the room is spacious TV works fine but the system is a bit of a pain like most hotels Amazing hotel with spacious rooms, excellent service and plenty of parking. The room was very clean and comfortable. Updated . Very friendly desk service staff Service was first class. Restaurant menu for celiacs - gluten free options - was abysmal. Had to leave the hotel to obtain food. Deluxe Room description says club level - club lounge access, continental breakfast, etc... but hotel says i have to pay extra to use it! What the..... Simply wrong descriptions to get more business. Staffs doesn’t even want to listen and double check what i booked for. Kept saying same things over and over. the description was wrong and gotta pay extra for that. Also a person(white canadian i guess) who checked right in front of me got free parking. Staff said i’m not eligible........ Discrimination?????????? Should i call my lawyer?? ? Price was for a luxury hotel and this falls short. Rooms need refurbishing, hair on bathroom floor Dinning area very nice The Sheraton is located close to the mall, beaches, and Softball City. Several of the teams participating in the 2016 Softball World Series stayed in this hotel. If you want a fridge, you will need to ask early. Every thing is great, except the Wi-Fi. The WiFi is pretty terrible unless you pay for the upgrade which is sad.
We stayed in a king-bed suite during the Farm Show this past weekend. Generally we enjoy staying at Country Inn and Suites because they have always been comfortable and really high quality. This particular hotel was not exactly what I was expecting, especially for the price we paid. The bed was very stiff and uncomfortable, there were unprofessional repair jobs in the bathroom (loose faucet, runs in the paint, grimy caulking, poor patching jobs), and on more than one occasion I found loose hairs in the linen and throughout the bathroom. Just not really the quality we have experienced in the past. That being said, all of the staff we encountered were very friendly, and the breakfast in the morning had a lot of good options to choose from. Also, the room was quiet and the area felt safe, with a lot of fast food and restaurants to choose from near by. While we were somewhat disappointed, I would still recommend this hotel solely based on the area and the safety, because we've had some scary experiences at other hotels in Louisville in the past. We stayed for 4 days, the room was nice and clean, the bathroom was nicely updated (except for the shower functions - that's the only thing that wasn't updated? ), and the beds were comfy. They gave us a complimentary crib for the baby which was nice and the included breakfast was great too. The baby loved the waffles. The biscuits and gravy was really good. My husband enjoyed the fitness room so he didn't lose routine. The only upset was I chose a hotel with a pool so I could take my babies swimming but there was another family in the pool every single day all hours of the day, I wouldn't have minded if they weren't so rowdy and making the pool wave like the ocean. My kids are younger and it scared them the first time so I didn't try again. They were pool hogs. It would have been nice if there was some monitoring of the pool use. Otherwise, without swimming our stay was great and the kids didn't seem to care about the pool after enjoying the activities of the zoo, malls, and museums, which were all a short distance from the hotel. Great location. Even with the highway right outside you can't hear a thing! This Country Inn is located right off the highway so it was easy to find. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated, and the beds were comfortable. The kids loved the heated indoor pool, and the breakfast offerings were ample. I seem to recall breaded chicken being served with biscuits, which I have never encountered at a hotel breakfast before. It looked great but I avoid gluten so can't vouch for the taste. The manager gave me two water bottles for the road as I was checking out. That was a nice final touch to a pleasant stay. Definitely recommended! The check in was quick. The room was clean and the breakfast was better than expected with fresh dishes to choose from. Good location near shopping and restaurants . Would recommend to traveling folks Hotel is very nice and clean. Staff was friendly at check in. Room was nice and neat. My wife always checks the entire room for any pests or issues and hasn't found anything wrong with any of the country inns we have stayed at. Hotel was out dated and bed was so uncomfortable, breakfast was bad. But with this price it was ok hotel not a 4.1/5 hotel. I do not recommend to my friends. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great place to stay for business or traveling through. My experience was nice. The room was arranged fantastically and felt like a home. Beautiful Room, Always had coffee( Fresh ), Great, staff, cleaning personel were pleasant and friendly Hotel was great for the price: updated decor, friendly staff, clean & free fresh cookies for guests :) nice, clean, older but very well kept motel, quiet for the most part Place was as advertised. Very clean and comfortable. We needed a handicap suite and it worked out well. Very satisfied! Broken sink? Hair behind it. Desk clerk was high on something. No pool towels , hot tub was way too hot. No cots or carts. If you are in the Louisville, KY area, and need a room that is clean, well equipped, the service is very friendly & helpful, and for a good price then you would do well to stay here. The room was very clean and spin entering hotel a fresh and clean area Hard bed hard could feel springs, other bed in room hard with giant sunken center area. Pubic hard on towels, crumbling paint and very cheap looking furnishings. Breakfast was horrible and cleaned up 30 min prior to time stated. Manager response in email after rating on their website very generic and impersonal. Lots of highway noise. Rooms were fine and pretty clean. The breakfast in the morning was nothing to be excited about. What food they did have, was all taken by one family. The pool area was much smaller than expected,  but my kids had fun swimming. Most of the staff was helpful when asked. The bed was comfortable, Although I had wished I brought my pillow from home. The hotel pillows were soft and squishy. I like the refrigerator microwave area. Plenty of room to spread out. The bathroom is nice, the shower is a little small, but no big issue. The only negative for me was the noise, the road noise was apparent all night. And the walls are thin and I could hear the man coughing in the next room. The staff is very friendly and willing to help. We did not eat breakfast, but there were several guests that seem to be enjoying the breakfast Since I was arriving late, I called the hotel from the road, and when we arrived check-in was very smooth- as they had everything waiting for us at the front desk. There was some confusion about breakfast hours, as we missed it our first morning, but the Waffle House up the street was very good. There were not any towel racks in the bathroom, so even though the hotel recommends re-using towels, there was no where to hang them, so we were forced to get clean ones every day. The breakfast was really good the first day (well, second since I missed the first) but it had very little protein available the next day-- and the raisins in the Raisin Bran were so hard it nearly brook my tooth-- I ended up eating at Waffle house most mornings. There is also a Cracker Barrel nearby, but at these prices, I feel the breakfast could be better. Over all was good, the Wi-Fi password did not work for us. The breakfast was not good. The room was clean and comfortable. We have stayed at this hotel before and when we were planning another trip to Louisville we didn't hesitate to book another stay that this venue It was a very nice family weekend. The room was large, pretty clean, and well organized but the bed was very uncomfortable. The pool had too much chlorine in it to where the entire first floor smells like it. Also, the WiFi was annoying since you have to log in every time you use your device. Clean room, firm comfy bed. Kids loved the pool. Hot tub was too hot. Breakfast lady couldn't keep up with the crowd and we had to wait for coffee, waffle batter, etc...Overall a good stay with friendly courteous staff Noisy heating unit when it kicked on. Otherwise, hotel was conveniently located and clean despite undergoing renovation. My girlfriend and I had not stayed with the chain for a while and were pleased with the updates. The location was convenient to most of our activities (and even 15-20 minutes to Waterfront Park/Big Four Bridge in off-peak traffic was reasonable). Our suite upgrade was only a few dollars more than a standard room and very much worth it, especially when I started snoring and subsequently got to experience the reasonably comfortable sofa bed in the front room. Breakfast offered a good variety and tasted fine. The pool isn't big but was thankfully warm. Complaints are few, and minor. The hot tub jets struggled to move much water around, and the water pressure in our shower was weak. Other than that, we would absolutely stay here again. We were in one of the 1 bedroom suites. We loved that we could shut the door to the bedroom after the kids went to sleep. However, the furniture in the living room space was not very comfortable and the bathroom wasn't very family friendly, the large door made it hard to maneuver with more than 1 person in there. The staff were very friendly! The facility seemed clean on all levels, from the carpeting in the halls to the crisp white sheets and blankets. For the price, it was fantastic! ! Beautiful updated rooms. Very clean and friendly staff. Lobby and common areas were in the middle of construction. Basic needs met during the stay. Convenient. Noisy neighbors dealt with in a timely manner. Kids had fun at the pool and hot tub. Great breakfast, friendly staff, would definitely go again. a hearty breakfast well served, large room -- clean Peeling paint, loud air conditioning unit, stains on couch, no sanitizer in the exercise room, overly hot exercise room. Would not go there again. the breakfast bar needs attention. When I got there- No coffee-It was brought out in a few minutes . Sausage laying in grease and was cold on the inside of patty. Fruit was still frozen solid. Preparation wasn't what it should have been The hotel itself was fine. The beds were uncomfortable. The sink was cracked. When I went to check out I stood at the desk for 10 minutes before anyone showed up. Second visit, quiet, friendly front desk people, clean, comfortable. Only complaint is that they shut the breakfast down early both times and was unable to make waffles when there was 30 minutes left. I was charged 3 times for my room. I only booked and used 2 rooms but was charged for 3.
This is not a 4 star hotel; the pictures on the website may have been taken in 1980. The lounge and ensuite bathroom is very old and dated. We went half board the breakfast was ok but the evening meals, we enjoyed one day out of 7. The waiters and waitress were sometimes rude. They are a lot of places to eat outside the hotel. WIFI is not free and the beach chairs are also not free you have to pay daily for the chairs. The beach is not comfortable to walk on it has stones with sharp sand you need aqua shoes. This hotel is for young families, they have activities every day all day. If you have children and you like a lot of noise this is the place for you. Nice four stars hotel. Many families with kids, less suitable for young travelers. Nice hotel close to the beach with modern facilities and friendly stuff. Breakfast and dinner were very good and with a lot of choices. What a disappointment - the check in  when I arrived was half hearted. The room was very noisy - I did ask for a quiet room on a high floor and was given a noisy room on the ground floor. The restaurant both at dinner and breakfast was uninviting and the food was not good. Added to this you had to pay for wifi which is not acceptable considering the prices of the rooms. Would not stay again. Very comfortable and clean hotel in a very good location for windsurfing. The staff were so nice especially Maria and Froso at breakfast. However there were many extras that you wouldn't expect to pay for in a 4* hotel such as sun beds on the beach and grass, wifi, the room safe. Good hotel although bungalows lack privacy - directly overlooked by sun bathers on grass terrace and beach - patio curtains need to be keep closed most of the time. Lovely sea views. Food  ok buffet style and can be very crowded. Overall good area and nice hotel facilities.
Our second time here, for an early morning doctor appointment. Nice young man checked us in and gave us information on local restaurants. Breakfast wasn't fancy but adequate. The free covered parking garage is a real bonus in the winter, with an elevator taking you right from there to your floor. After breakfast I went to the checkout desk but there was no one there, so I went up to the room and packed up. Upon returning to the checkout 10 minutes later, 2 ladies were there trying to resolve some kind of a Point program issue with the lady at the counter, and I had to wait about 10 minutes till it was finally resolved. When I got to her, she told me I didn't need to do anything as I had already pre-booked. So far this is about the best place I stayed in Kingston for what I needed. It is away from downtown so it is too far to walk but quick drive to anywhere. Lots of free parking, breakfast was ok. The most surprise thing is the room size. Two queen size beds, love chair. Even the wife was impressed. So far stayed at other hotel, AirBnB, BednBreakfast, University Dorm Room, apartment. Nobody beat this place in price and room size. Will come back again. Clean spacious rooms for a good price. Will stay again in the future. The room was very spacious. It was a short drive downtown and had a lot of choice for breakfast...and the price was very affordable. Rowdy Party at 3 am. Someone woke me asking for ice at 5:30. Bed was fine , Modern HD tv only had analogue channels. Carpets and furniture very old and faded and curtains were torn......That being said, a place to sleep was all I wanted while attending a funeral, and I had been here before, but I wouldn’t Recommend to my friends. It is very Comfortable to stay. Big room. Good tap-water pressure. Comfortable for bath. Fast check-in from very friendly staff. Room was clean, large and very quiet. Hotel faced on a main street close to shopping and restaurants but rooms were behind the office overlooking a quiet residential area. Good coffee and bagels etc for breakfast. My girlfriend and I were celebrating our 1st Anniversary. The entire room was perfect however, after an unwanted party in the next room we were rudely awoke. After 4 calls in a timeframe of 2 hours, the night supervisor finally had to have police attend. We were fully refunded but, memories cannot be erased for our special weekend. I've stayed in this hotel before and always enjoy it. It's very quiet and the rooms are huge. The location is good. The suites are unique. If you're ritzy and like perfection, it's not for you. However, if you like personality at a great price, this is a go to. We have stayed here multiple times. No complaints. The only thing lacking is a good restaurant near by, although there is a lot of fast food. Hotel is at the edge of town just off the 401 - super easy to find and located within walking distance of groceries etc. Good for business trip. Budget hotel no pool breakfast vey simple coffee bread , no milk for kids . No pancake machine , hotel is clean good for one night sleep over I have needed a clean simple place to rest my head whenever I travel to Kingston for business. This place does the trick, and their pricing is very fair. As above the front desk clerk was very rude for the amount of money I spent I am very disappointed They say their was smoke in the room and are hokdibg the deposit just a money grab Pretty good for standard basic hotel experience. Nothing NEW in the place, but clean and the beds are comfy. Nice clean hotel with comfortable beds and facilities.. close to shopping and downtown..definitely would recommend  staying here whether out of town working or just passing through Room was very clean, continental breakfast good. Cereal, juices, toast bagels, boiled eggs were set up a bit away from rest so missed the first morning. Bed was amazingly comfortable, room very clean. Only complaint for me was I had training here and the room we had occupied was very cold but staff worked quickly to get us switched to another room that had better heat. Comedy club two doors down from main entrance. Definitely visiting again. On behalf of myself and my friend I wish to thank Travel Lodge and staff for such a quiet and comfortable overnight  stay. We found staff to be thoughtful and courteous and above all professional and if I may say so five star service all the way. We also wish to mention Hotels.com and thank them for what I call a no fuss no muss booking from the moment I called to conformation. It might have taken five min. start to finis. thank-you, and friends and family have already heard from us. Once again thank-you and MERRY X-MASS! A freezing rain storm was moving in, and when I noticed that there was a covered parking lot under the building, I went to the front desk to ask if I could park my car underneath even though I knew I couldn't check in for several hours. The person at the front desk was very nice and not only allowed me to get my car out of the nasty freezing rain but said I could also check in early! This was very, very much appreciated as I didn't want to spend an hour scraping my car off the next day. They are undergoing renovations on the floor I was staying on, but they didn't begin working with any tools until after 9:00 a.m., so it didn't bother us a bit. Thanks very much! We have have stayed at this hotel several times and we found the staff very helpful, informative, friendly and accommodating. It is not a luxury hotel but they have all the basic things you will need inside the rooms -- no need to request in advance. The rooms - most especially the bathrooms - are always clean. After a long drive, it is always nice to know what awaits you. Excellent for the price. Everything you need. Clean. Decent location (if you have a car). Didn’t take advantage of the breakfast but I’m sure it’s fine. Would definitely recommend. Great stay. The breakfast lady needs to smile but overal stay was great. Would come back again Great place to stay for a great price. Skip the breakfast however. They don't have much except for cereal, coffee, and some stale muffins Very nice experience I stayed this hotel on Feb 23. Great Stay, Very friendly, good price & comfortable. The room is big enough and I like its hardwood (laminate ) floor in room, it  is better than carpet. The breakfast , to be fair, it is quite good ! They provided Bread, Cereal, muffins, juice, milk, yogurt, egg, fruit...and hot drinks. It saved me time & money driving for breakfast . Staff was excellent. Room spotless. Walls a little thin so expect some sound from adjoining room. I am happy about my stay and will recommend this place. The staff was very nice, one day I came late for the breakfast and the lady in charge still offer us ( my brother and me) something fr the breakfast. Very quiet location with good surroundings. We had a comfortable stay here. The room could handle a little refreshing. Bed was very comfy. I was a little upset that the TV listings in the hotel binder did not coincide with TV channels, you had to search all channels do to the fact  there wasn't a guide of any sort to select from. Great amenities and facilities and the breakfast was good enough. Underground parking. The only downside was that it was far from the center. Too far than I thought it would be. Will select this Hotel on future visits, even if a bit too pricy.
The hotel is petite but the facilities is mordern. The breakfast is value for money in Tromso. The service is nice. The place was good and near to City Center Great base for exploring Tromso - clean, comfortable, friendly and helpful staff. Communal kitchen useful to allow you to cook your own food and make a hot drink. Well located with only a short walk to local amenities and sights. We booked a double room and a triple room for a total of five adults. A day before check in, Enter Backpack Hotel upgraded our room to a family room in its sister hotel (Amalie Hotel)  which I thought it would be better. But we found out that they gave us a very small family room with only four beds which is not enough for five adults to sleep. We talked to the receptionist about this issue but he kept us waiting for around one hour as there were a lot of customers coming in and he was the only one who was working on that day. Eventually another more experienced receptionist came in and we requested to add an extra bed in our room FOC. He agreed and helped us to settle the issue. So the small room became even packed after fitting in one more bed but that's the best they could give us. Anyway, Amalie Hotel is near to the city centre, restaurants and most of the meeting points of those tours which is quite convenient to stay if you are not driving. The hotel provides free coffee and tea at all time too. Not recommended for group of more than 4 people. Decently priced hotel, considering the average prices in Tromso. The room was very clean and modern, and large enough for a single traveler like me. The bed was big and comfy, bed sheet, blanket, pillow case and towels were quite new. There's even a small arm chair and fridge. Minor complaints are the lack of shampoo (shower foam is provided) and the fact that the toilet gets quite cold in winter. Otherwise, a really excellent choice and value for money. 2-3 minutes from Tromso city center. Really comfortable place. It has a nice window view to see the city from uphill. The price is also very cheap compared to other hotels in tromso staff are really nice, the room is so clean as well We had one night to spend in Tromso and this offered a triple room. It was clean and comfortable. Staff very helpful. Sadly the three keys we had all failed after we returned from a long walk looking for the lights. We had to ring the sister hotel and wait for someone to cut a new key. Not very convenient. Other than that it was fine. Great staff, location, cleanliness! I stayed for a week, I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. They took my money (quite a lot of money), refused to give a refund and then on-sold my room. To add insult to injury the receptionist would not call the manager when I tried to check in and threatened to call the police. While I can't comment with authority about the hotel facilities, room cleanliness or comfort I have marked these as terrible because, despite having paid for my room I never even got to check these out. This hotel looks better than what it looks in photos. Rooms are small but serves the purpose. Very clean and helpful staff. Walkable from city centre. and Got to see best northern lights right in front of hotel.
As we planned, the experience was relaxing. For our first night in Europe after flying from US to Barcelona we decided for this hotel to have a good night of sleep and visit Montserrat on our first day in Spain. Unhelpful, rude staff with the exception of 3 staff members whom unfortunately I Lack of empathy for tourists. The hotel is about 30-40 minutes drive from the airport and to the city. Taxis to either location costs roughly 70-80 euros. Majority of those staying in the hotel are Spanish and the buffett at breakfast and dinner is decent at 18 euros per meal (although if u book at the reception this can be lowered). the outdoor pool is spacious enough to accommodate around 20-25 people.
It is near to Kawashi JR train station. Outside there is Takashimaya mall and around there is many places for a proper meal. I would recommend friends to stay if they going to japan. Good and thumb up. We had a nice time staying there. It is in the lively neighborhood, but very quiet inside the hotel or rooms. Convenient to grab something quick to eat and drink, or sit-down restaurants as well if you like finer food.
good location, room, breakfast. reception staff VERY unwelcoming, not smiling, dismissive, rude. checked me into a smoking room despite request. when went down to tell the receptionist, she didn't believe me and sent me up again with a bellboy. after twice up and down (in the slow elevators), I had to wait another 40 minutes. When my guide came with me to the hotel for an hour, the bully at the reception pounded on me aggressively and said it's not allowed without payment. Nothing about this was mentioned in advance during reservation or reception or service directory. 10 minutes of arguments ensued until the manager relented. check in was quick but none too friendly. The room was large but very sparsley decorated and the air conditioning was like a jet engine - seriously but other than that the room was comfortable and I spent some time thinking how sensational it could be especially at the price I was paying. I enjoyed breakfast very much although it is very loud but other food choices were very poor - some inedible! Overall I am sorry to say this but this was a 5* hotel price with little more than 2* facilities. The pool area was a disaster - the bar was never manned and even when calling for service, took quite some time to respond - 3 loungers and a pool the size of a plunge pool which was too hot to use in the afternoon - think about refrigeration for the summer months. The worst experience of my life and I use Expedia every time I travel. I also had to make my own way to and from the hotel at a cost of 250 reals when I had already paid for transfers with expedia. Excellent place to stay the comfort and staff and door was great. I reported a leaking in the bathroom and they showed up to fix it next day. They didn't want to change rooms. The shower wasn't very clean. It is conveniently close to the beach and the subway station. Also several stores and restaurants are available close. Good view of the Christ statue on the top floor. Good value for the area, older classic hotel refurbed. Simple and clean. We booked a last minute reservation on a crowded Samba weekend night. Got the last room available, it happened to be two twins. Front Desk Manager noticed us headed out for the evening, and unrequested, sent somebody up to push the two beds together and make them up as a King. Good Service, Nice touch! Hotel Did meet our expectation. Its one block from the beach.Some staff were very good. We didnt get the room we wanted even though we asked for certain type of room. Breakfast was one the feature of this hotel. I would recommend based on price and breakfast. Well located near beach and numerous commercial establishments, even a park across the street. Very attentive staff. Excellent breakfast. Good accommodations. Comfortable bed. Big cockroach under our bed, they robbed us at the beach and I had to cancel my credit cards but was not able to make any international call from the hotel which was really disappointing as I was in total despair to block my credit cards. They even charged me for those calls that were only attempted but the calls did not go through.
When we first arrived, there was a knock at our door and they said someone had complained our TV did not work. It was not us, because we literally had just walked in. They looked at the TV and then left. Within about an hour there was another knock at the door, but this time they just let theirself right into the room. Luckily I was in the bathroom, but this angered my husband very bad. The guy said he had a complaint that our TV did not work. My husband explained this issue had been fixed and they needed to communicate with other workers. Our air conditioner did not work either. The fornt desk said they would have someone look at it. We got in late and although it did not work, we went to sleep anyways. When we spoke to the front desk the next day, they said they had saved us another room but were waiting to hear from us?? This upset us again, because they should have let us know the status of the air conditioner by note or phone call. I was very disappointed with the staff and the condition of our room. I believe this hotel has great potential if the employees would be better. We asked for sheets to be changed during our 5 night stay, they only made the bed and the sheets remained the same not changed out, how do we know this, we had popcorn while watching a movie and found popcorn the next day in the bed sheets. After that we tested if the sheets were cleaned with makeup, and the popcorn and makeup was still on the sheets for our entire stay. Yes we continued to complain and asked to have them changed. On the walls in the bathroom someone scribbled with a pen on the walls the tile was chipped. the carpet was filthy in the corners. During our entire stay the carpet was not vacuumed. When I complained about our room not being cleaned, the girl at the desk responded by saying that they were short staffed. I believe if this hotel could hire new staff and staff and train them properly, this has the potential of being a very nice hotel. The restaurant had very nice decor, however the breakfast help was awful and the women was rude and had a child hand us our check. We only went there the one morning and recommend it to be avoided. Apart from not being given a room on an upper floor we had a good experience. Disappointing that the restaurant appeared closed for breakfast. Great location, just steps from the beach, and 5 minutes from downtown. Had a blast! Really enjoyed our stay, cannot fault the staff and room. Great location, fir local sightseeing and visiting further afield. The only criticism is the use of disposable cups and beakers instead of china and glass. I think this is probably widespread through America not just this hotel but i dread to think of the environmental impact My girlfriend and I stayed there for my birthday weekend. We loved the oceanfront room with the Jacuzzi that we selected. Huge room, great view. Very nice , 1 min from the beach. Very clean , no complaints at all. Way too much money for a totally obstructed “ocean view.” I was totally satisfied with this place. The only thing I would have appreciated would have been more towel bars in the bath. Also the photos of the room don’t show how large the hot tub really is. Very clean room, good service,very quiet, easy access to St.Augustine, very close to beautiful beach Nice accommodations. Close to everything. Great staff and excellent service. Very good restaurant on site. The hotel was clean and neat. Room was nice. Nikki at the front desk was very helpful. Jacuzzi was non functional as was the sauna pool and spa needed cleaning a very disappointing stay I. Would not recommend this hotel The room was excellent! The tub was wonderful and the bed was so comfortable I didn’t want to get up. The staff was always very friendly regardless of the hour We loved out king size room. Very clean, comfortable and great view of the ocean. Perfect hotel as beach view rooms face the beach! Front desk staff, restaurant, and housekeeping staff were friendly and answered all questions without being put out. Very clean rooms. Excellent restaurant. Not an Ocean View. But, the patio's are nice. Everyone of the staff is very pleasant. We highly recommend this hotel (Castillo Real). In the future, we'd probably opt for a later-in-the-season stay; for our April trip, the surf was cold and the weather mostly overcast each day. Amazing hotel, great location and friendly staff. Hot tub/jacuzzi in the room. Great hotel! Adequate comfort and decor for a family visit. No bar in hotel but we heard the restaurant was good. Amazing time at the Castillo! Fabulous staff and service! Would stay again! Stayed here some years back decided to come back and reacquaint myself with the hotel. It’s still awesome. The only place I will stay in St. Augustine. Staff is friendly and always helpful. Rooms are extraordinary, nice and cozy. Pool and spa area are well maintained. Beach access is literally like stepping out the back door of your room. I’m very picky. This hotel is a winner. Very clean, good service and very friendly staff. Only negative thing was breakfast was not free and as expensive as the hotel was per night you would think breakfast would be included. great Hotel and great location right on the beach and a short bike ride from town. All was excellent. A couple of suggestions. I was a little surprised and somewhat disappointed that:   the toiletries was not high quality; no shower caps; no shower bars for holding onto; and no complementary water. These things would certainly upgrade the status. We enjoyed our stay. The staff and service was outstanding. The room was clean. The location worked for everything we wanted to do. Great location and Spanish decor It was tops for any stay in the USA. The Castillo Real was a fun stay and more visually interesting than a chain hotel. It had everything I needed. Breakfast is not included in the room rate, but you can get a discount coupon for the hotel's restaurant from the front desk if you ask for it the night before. I had Room 204 and it was quiet except that a couple of times I could hear the person above me walking on the tile - must have been wearing high heels. This hotel is about half a block from the beach and has several restaurants only a short distance away. A good place to stay - would recommend it. This hotel was an excellent choice for us. It was very clean and conveniently located close to the beautiful St. Augustine beach. The gentlemen that worked at the front desk  (?I think his name is Shelton) was highly professional and so patient with us. He made the best first impression and went out of his way to be accommodating. Traveling with a baby and a large group we had many needs and he went out of his way to help us. This made all the difference in our stay. Overall we were pleased with the hotel. It was quiet. The rooms were fairly spacious. The pool was clean, well maintained and always had enough clean towels for use at the pool or beach. The food at the restaurant was good. You could buy a voucher for breakfast the night before. My only recommendation would be that they offer a little more reasonably priced options for dinner and lunch. We did end up eating out at different restaurants in the area. There are plenty to pick from. Overall we had a great stay at the Castillo Real and would stay there again. We loved the spacious rooms where even the extra space required by children and teens did not leave us feeling cramped. The black-out drapes were great though they made it hard to wake up in time for the sun rise show each morning. The restaurant served very good food though the service was sometimes very slow. The pool with its zero-entry was great for our 3 and 4 year-olds. The beds were very comfortable with great comforters. We had a very comfortable stay. We Would of given much better rating but no internet reception in our room unless we held phone to window. The linen on the bed was very wrinkled the sheet and comforter. one day out of three we had someone clean our room there was a damp towel left on the bed and other towels left that should of been replaced. When we checked out very early the last day we weren't asked if we enjoyed our stay or no thank you nothing. On the flip side it is beautiful there and easy access to beautiful beach and nice pool and laundry facilities. Location is very good. Parking was easy and very nicely located. Walking distance to good restaurants and shops. Very expensive then had to pay for breakfast. Hot tub partially inop. This is a great small hotel in St Augustine beach...the 2 queen room was very large and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We had a king room with a hot tub. The hot tub was wonderful and surprisingly huge! The walk-in shower was very nice also! The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. We had a wonderful stay and will return again if we come bach to St Augustine! Great find in the St Augustine, Fla area, was really surprised with the quality of the hotel, and the staff were great. The restaurant in the hotel was first class. Wish there had been a cocktail lounge though, only drawback. Beautiful room with great hot tub. Decided to stay an extra day because of relaxing amenities. Clean, quiet, and comfortable. This place is about a 10 minute drive from the historic part of St Augustine. This will be the place we stay when we return. Very nice decor. Bed very comfortable. Only issue was the fan on the Ac was a little loud. Clean Rooms. Beautiful views, pool was awesome, great for kids. Nice area so close to beach. 10 min from downtown. Loved it! Will be back! Well when you walk in, you get a feel of Class and elegance.. Kinda of a Spanish theme, everyone has different taste.. But I really liked the way the place was decorated.. Our room was pretty awesome!! King size bed and a big jetted tub for 2.. It was very nice and clean and the Staff was excellent.. Zero complaints... Soooooo close to the beach!! I liked it so much when it was suppose to be our last night, I stayed one more night and if I had enough money I would have stayed another week!! Wasn't far from Downtown St. Augustine either.. I will be back soon! The room was exquisite the bed was very comfortable and the tub was a very nice touch absolutely loved the view from my balcony. A nice place to sit and watch the sunrise. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to any of my friends. Excellent location and beautifu architectural scenery! Rooms were as expected; beautiful view of ocean. Breakfast was outstanding. Good location for beach activities. Forgot to freshen up room one day. Uniformed desk clerk. Nice, clean and comfortable! Friendly staff! Grounds good. Restaurant was nice. Will stay again. Nice hotel just a short walk to the beach and short ride to the Old City. The hotel was clean with a very nice pool. The rooms furniture/drapes are in need of an update, but the room itself was clean. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. We would definitely stay at the Castillo Real again. Nice hotel but overpriced. Not on Beach. Restaurant is outrageous overpriced ala carte. Room had no Sofa or comfortable furniture to sit on... Paid the pre-paid rate and was willing to forfeit that, but hotel charged me for another night for a room I never used. Staff said it was one nights room and tax if cancelled. Guess I should have gotten one night back. Great place to stay. My only complaint would be the rather chintzy  towels +  no extra soap for showers.
The stand out feature wa the friendliness. The reception area was relaxed and comfortable. The breakfasts were very good on the rooftop terrace. Overall there was an atmosphere of peace and welcome. This hotel was very satisfactory in all aspects ... location, cleanliness, good breakfast, accomodating staff. It was, in our mind, a bit improvement over another hotel that we'd stayed at earlier, which was located down the street. Would definately recommend this place to any friends or relatives should they be seeking convenient accomodations in Tel Aviv. Good value - especially the breakfast. Plumbing worked (no bath). Bed comfortable (fridge noisy - unplugged it). Some rooms have terrible views of the building next door - but who cares if you're just staying one night? Great location 100m from the beach. I was there for nearly two weeks, starting the last week of October.2017. I had an economy room on the fourth floor, which was very clean and adequate for my needs. The hotel is located on a side street, in a part of town that is old, and much of it is either under construction or renovation. You need to really pay attention when walking in the area. There are two convenience stores, a pharmacy, and places to exchange or purchase currency within a block radius. The Thai restaurant a few blocks away was very good as was the Landwer's Cafe on the promenade. There are buses and taxis close by, and many attractions either within walking distance or accessible by a short and inexpensive bus ride. The beaches and beautiful promenade is one block away, and there is a lot of construction taking place along the beachfront drive. Breakfast is served on the top floor of the hotel, and has a good view of the beach. Spent 3 nights at this hotel and we're very satisfied with all the personnel we've encountered, the cleanliness and the location. From my reservation to the Tours we've booked, Shirley has been very responsive to all my emails and updates. The hotel has a huge lobby with ample sitting, coffee or espresso machine and a fridge where you can purchase sodas and beer. The rooms are immaculately cleaned daily with fresh towels. The breakfast on the 6th floor is always the highlight of my day with so many selections. The location is only a couple minutes from the beach/boardwalk and about a 30 minute walk to Old Jaffa Port. I'd like thank Shirley's team, Viktor, Jonathan and Max for making our stay a relaxed and happy one...  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293984-d1420401-r527677937-Hotel_Gilgal-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html# Staff made you so welcome on arrival and quickly got you to be confident in the Hotel and surroundings. Breakfast excellent and available late to allow a lie in. Roof terrace gave excellent view of the beach but would have benefitted with a bar for effect. The rooms in this hotel are absurdly small. Certain members of the staff were decidedly rude. Rooms are in good condition, everyting is working, only in the WC I found hairs in the sink, on the walls near the sink and the toilet had a smell of  p..... Everything else was OK. Really good breakfast. Perfect pillows, comfortable beds. Overall it is a very pleasant hotel. The bed was comfortable as was the climate controls. The staff was professional and personable. My TV had only 1 English channel coming through, which was disappointing, but I didn't go to Israel to watch TV. I didn't make use of it, but their are washers and dryers at the lower level with complimentary detergent if you need to wash your clothes. Not that impressed with Tel Aviv. Hotel good, breakfast was amazing. Jerusalem was good. I have one of the best experience friendless of the staff Victor, Jonathan...the art décor, the rooms,  the libraries the spiritual side  of Gilgal is a plus for me. The location of this hotel is incredible 3 minutes walk to the beach. A lovely location, comfortable bed and room and awesome breakfast We loved the hotel...the lobby was beautiful with hand painted murals and striking sculptures. The breakfast was amazing, much more than we expected from their 6th floor dining area which had great views. The staff was VERY helpful and courteous. The ONLY thing I had a hard time with is that I need a very soft bed. I had to put blankets under me because the bed was too firm for me. My husband had no problem sleeping on the bed the way it was, it was just because of my current physical condition. If you are good with a firm mattress, then you will love it. However, i did sleep very well once I got comfortable. Had a sudden change in plans so only needed to stay one of the three nights that I booked through Orbitz. Did not take the non refundable option so thought there would be no issue Checked in around 11 PM and asked about checking out the next day. The person at the front desk requested that we come by in the morning when the manager was there. We had to check out before he arrived but called to explain. The manager stated no problem; the unused nights would be refunded. Called Orbitz 2 weeks later and they followed up with the hotel who informed Orbitz that they would refund only one night. I would have been OK with that had I been told upfront. Very disappointed that they turned a good customer relations gesture into a bad taste. Would not recommend for this reason. that we come down the next morning when the manager
We haven't stayed here before, but certainly will again. The hotel is very modern, great reception area - very well designed. Our room, superior (607) was a good size, up to date bathroom; nicely designed. Comfy beds with soft pillows (really good to have them!). Breakfast was excellent too - lots of choice with friendly helpful staff. In fact, all the staff we met were friendly and eager to be of assistance. This is an exceptionally well run hotel. Would strongly recommend This is our second stay at the Park Plaza and it didn’t disappoint. The location is convenient as there are restauarants convenient to the hotel, its a 3 minute walk from Victoria Station, and you can walk to Buckingham Palace and the Westminster Area. The rooms are quite large for London and they have a King Size bed and you can  control all the room amenities from your bedside. They have wall USB outlets and even a North American plug outlet. The staff are all nice and friendly. This hotel is wonderful value for the price. The location is very convenient if you frequently use public transportation. Walking distance to Buckingham palace, Apollo Victoria Theatre, etc. But isn't very close to the river and Westminster. The facility is very modern. Safa-bed for child is very comfortable in the guest room though the room space is kind of small. You may get discounted breakfast if you booked before midnight. Be careful in the bathroom. The floor is too slippy with wet. I experienced falling down. First off must start by saying the hotel staff was really nice. We checked in easily and headed up to our room where the cleaning staff must have left the air conditioning on. However as we were told later the hotel still calls April their winter season and there is no air conditioning...only heat. So when we got up to our room it felt like 300 degrees. We had to get out immediately and went back down to reception. The apologized and upgraded us to a apartment style 1 bedroom room. The room was really dated and a little dirty. But by this point we were tired and were only staying for 2 nights so we left it alone. So just beware. No air conditioning in April. It's warm and uncomfortable at night. nice modern clean stylish quiet rooms - enough said 3rd stay for us in this excellent facility; sizeable rooms and terrific breakfast buffet. Handy to public transportation. Barman makes his martinis too watery but otherwise another excellent stay. Tile grout in bathroom is dirty, otherwise a good value, friendly, helpful staff. Location is very convenient to multiple theaters and restaurants. very nice discovery in a nice area with good connections to everywhere I am pleased with Expedia's arrangements. Everything went smoothly. Friendly, comfortable, and great spa fitness space. Location made it easy to catch trains to visit friends. Victoria Station has many shops and places to grab a quick bite. Not fine dining, but haute cuisine was not on our list this trip. Great location  Room a little bit small but clean  bathroom with a cool see through sink t Great location, centrally located to most major attractions, lots of amenities nearby, friendly and courteous staff. Would definitely stay again and/or recommend to others. Clean, friendly staff and covinenent location right next to the tube. Would love to stay here again if I stay in London. Very good hotel, excellent location and good value for money I spent 3-4 hours online trying to narrow down my choice for this London/Portsmouth/Canterbury trip with a wonderful English roommate I have previously shared twin bed rooms with. Roommate has recently developed mobility issues, so I prioritized train station proximity. Also, roommate wants breakfast and for me, if we have breakfast, I want to return to my room to clean my teeth. So, even though English breakfasts seem rediculously expensive, This was a strategic choice. There are less expensive options in the lobby bar and across the street. I'm noise sensitive and was concerned about the roads. Very happy to report the whole building (and our room) was very quiet. I came in on a red-eye, so appreciated being able to check my bag and settle in the lobby with wifi access whilst I waited for Roommate. A cup of tea later we departed for city activities until evening. I initially had difficulty finding the hotel from Victoria station because I didn't know which way east was. Simple hint: the trains come in facing north. Train platforms 1 and 2, are on the east side. Find them. There is a smallish side door (to the east) (covered passage.) Cross the street and go under the underpass, turn right and the Park Plaza is a couple hundred feet down on your left. Very helpful doorman came out to help me before I was even sure I got it right. Thanks A lovely hotel that's very close to several attractions and lots of great restaurants. Very pleasant staff. Room states king size bed but it was two twins pushed together and sliding apart due to wheels on bottom, not comfortable for someone 6’4”. Perfect location easy to use hotel Some lovely staff there, but some had a poor attitude and made me and members of my party feel we were a nuisance. Some were just incompetent. Perfectly fine room well located in central London no major complaints and the value was pretty good. Found room quite small for price paid. Room very quiet for location. I was a bit disappointed on several fronts. First the Air-conditioning did not work. They fixed it, but was never working properly. Secondly, after returning back to our room on the first day, late in the afternoon, we found our room was never cleaned for the day. We had to call housekeeping to have this done. The placement of Mirrors for getting ready in the morning were not in a convenient place, one was in a closet and the other on an adjoining wall. Not at the Desk where you can sit and get ready. Realizing some of these points may seem minimal, but after paying the rate you pay for this hotel, I found it below standard. We were there for 6 nights in a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was to have privileges such as Lounge access, 20% off meals,etc. I discovered this the day before checkout. My key did not work in the Lounge. Went to the Front Desk and asked if I had Lounge access- at that time they said yes- I notified them my key did not work in the Lounge and they give me a new key. Never was the 20% discount mentioned- we ate lunch at the hotel at least 4 times with guests. At least 3 times I stopped by the Front Desk and made them aware this information was not provided at check in- nor anytime after. At checkout I made them aware again- and spoke with the Manager. She gave me her business card. No credit- nothing!!!! I will never stay there again. These perks were included in the rate so there should have been some type of compensation. A standard basic room would have been better as I did not receive the benefits as entitled with the apartment. Also, we telephoned the hotel directly to make sure they had a guest laundry- where we could do our own laundry and not send it out. The hotel said yes- when we asked where the laundry was located- there wasn't one. They send the laundry out. This hotel gives misinformation and does not provide the benefits or services as stated.. The hotel is only 1 block from Victoria Station. We spent a week in London, at the Park Plaza Victoria, and we were very pleased with the location, and how easy it was to navigate the Tube system from that location. Also, when we booked a bus tour to Stone Henge, the Victoria Coach Station was walking distance from the hotel. Also within walking distance were Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and the London Eye. There were several great coffee shops up and down Wilton Street, and a very nice English Pub called Prince of Wales was one block down. When I return to London, I will definitely stay here again. Great location, very close to Victoria underground station. The hotel was clean and modern, would definitely stay there again. Great quiet hotel Moved me out of disabled room upon request. Breakfast was average to below average; not worth the price. 2 minute walk to train/underground. 15 minute walk to buckingham palace/Westminster abbeys etc Check in quick. Rooms were ready early when we arrived from our cruise ship. Neighborhood restaurants excellent as was the breakfast buffet in the hotel. Very knowledgeable concierge staff. Great value for the price. Close to Victoria Train and subway station. Also have lot of restaurants close by to choose from. We chose this hotel for it's proximity to Victoria and were very pleased with our stay. The hotel service is fantastic and the room was of a good size and with excellent sound proofing compared to many hotel we have stayed in. I thought the price was reasonable for the location and the quality of the hotel.
Nice pool, beach area and buffet breakfast. The standard rooms however are quite small and had only one functioning plug socket. Ok for a short stay, would not stay in the same room type again but hotel is nice otherwise. On the up side: The hotel had a great location. It was nice and clean. Food was excellent! On the down side: They advertised free parking but only had 85 parking spots for 341 rooms, so it was on a first come, first served principle. Therefore, I ended up having to pay a pretty steep price for parking. They also messed up on one of my reservations (we had 3 rooms), but they did fix the problem. Additionally, you had to pay separately to use the pool and to rent beach chairs. All that being said, it was a very nice and pleasant vacation. Parking is a challenge. The parking in front of the hotel belongs to someone else and so it's paid, and the hotel free parking is around the side of the hotel. You have to walk all the way around the hotel and there's no access from the back. On weekends it's almost impossible to get a spot and they won't open the barrier even if they still have some open. They told us it's for the boss. What a joke! I will never book a hotel with hotels.com again! Constanta was very amazing in that I was able to relax and enjoy myself. Even though it was a short holiday, I was very impressed with the area.. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. There was a moldy smell in the bathroom, and at certain times of day a sewage smell as well. Air conditioning wasn't working properly. So-so food available at breakfast. Customer service was terrible. Thin walls and noisy neighbors. Uncomfortable beds. Pretty much my worst hotel experience ever. For that price, there are much better places on the beach. It is the second year in a row we came to this hotel and will come again! Friendly staff. Clean room and bathroom. Modern furniture. Big TV with channels from 2 providers (including HBO package). The breakfast was delicious and varied every day, which was nice. Big parking lot, with security. Wouldn't hurt to have a Do not disturb sign available in all rooms :) Last year, we had one, this year didn't.
There are many rooms that have not even a coffee maker or you should change your room and pay 11 euro. The refrigerator wasn't so cold and the hotel was a little far from most attraction places if some one wants to go by walk . Their staffs were friendly and polite, hotel cleanness was acceptable. The room are clean, but a little noice from the neighbour room even I donot know what happened. Close and comfortable at a great price and it you are not afraid of walking it is close enough to walk to tourist places about 20 min away My husband and I had stayed here twice before and therefore had no hesitation to book again for our recent trip to Spain with a group of 5 other friends. Madrid was the first and last stop on our two-week trip across the northern coast of Spain. Everything was perfect, as usual, and our friends fell in love with the this hotel as we knew they would. The parking at the hotel is expensive and they do not have at least a discount for guess. My check in was with a trainee, and she was rude Ideal location for an active stay with good links to get into Madrid centre Great location in quiet and safe neighborhood. River and river trail are directly across the street. Rooms are spacious and modern with all modern comforts. Wifi is not the best but its not that bad either. Well positioned to explore Madrid. A modern well presented hotel by the river. GOT ROBBED INSIDE RESTAURANT AND STAFF Very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff.
Hotel is a little older, But clean. Pet friendly with no fees. A little confusing because there is another LaQuinta a quarter mile down the same road. The room was nice as well as the staff. I would stay here again. Staff was nice, room was so so. For the money we paid for the room, the breakfeast was subpar. room was adequate and clean. staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was simple but adequate. Fast cheery checkin. Breakfast a little crowded although fairly good selection. Looking for a hotel on a budget for our group, La Quinta Inn was perfect. Conveniently located, clean, with super kind and friendly staff, we enjoyed our stay. Front desk staff were extremely nice and helpful. We stopped here on our drive to Orlando and were underwhelmed. You get what you pay for! It wasn’t a terrible place, just nothing special. Such a great experience. The bed was ultra soft, just the way I like it. The room was a good size and had good amenities. Not super close to downtown but it is a straight shot to get there. Savannah is a beautiful city and a must see. You won’t go wrong staying at this hotel. Oh yeah...  the continental breakfast was good also!! ! The hotel staffs are very nice. The hotel needs some renovation, some of things are old, like beds, carpet, lighting. There are no outlets for charging the cell phone by the beds. The location of this hotel was prefect and being pet friendly is a bonus since Savannah is a dog friendly city. Hotel was clean and bed was comfortable. The problem was the loud traffic noise that made it difficult to sleep. The front desk ladies were very helpful and polite and professional. We stayed 2 nights and our room was not cleaned. We Had to go ask for fresh towels. We took out the do not disturb card so our room could be cleaned while we were out for the day and we came back late at night and our room had not been cleaned. Comforter had hairs on it so that wasn't the best,  but otherwise the room seemed clean and the bed was comfy. Good for price. Wish I wasn't so cheap and willing to pay for a more expensive room! The rooms were very small,and two small bed. I was really disappointed Very comfortable and staff were super. Breakfast room was too crowded and we ate out. Everyone came down at the same time. The staff was so friendly! Breakfast was enjoyable, too! Nice hotel near many amenities. Around 30 minutes from the beach I booked this hotel because it was more affordable than others in the area. Overall, we were very happy with our stay. The staff was friendly and available to answer questions. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. My only complaint is housekeeping didn't make the beds a couple of times, but seriously this wasn't a big deal to us. Also this hotel is about 15mins outside of the historic district, so it was super easy to access what we were looking for. 2nd time at this hotel....My room 307 was filthy and the sheets had a red lipstick stain on the the fitted sheet on the right side by the end table. Could not be sure if they had changed the sheets from the prior occupant. When you walk into the room there is a tile floor that was sticky and had not been mopped in a long time. Maybe they need to invest in some Swiffers to clean this area each time. I cleaned it with one of the towels from the shower and it turned completely black. The neighborhood this hotel is located in is a little rough but I knew this when I booked the place. Dirty moldy bathroom not properly cleaned Good location if you don't want to stay in historic Savannah. Very clean and breakfast had many cold choices, cereal, yogurt, fruit, breads and hot waffles... Just don't expect  hot eggs and bacon/sausages. Very friendly staff. Clean room. One day trip to Savannah Historical area The staff was very nice, responsive and helpful. Condition kind of run down. TV didn't work. Tried 2 different remotes. Their personnel are great, but I probably wouldn't stay there again. Great Good service, clean Rooms, decent breakfast. It was about 15 minutes outside of downtown Savannah. Hotel was packed and breakfast ended at 9am so we couldn’t find a seat. Rooms were nicely decorated, clean, comfy beds, etc. No odors in the room. In fact, the entire property was odor-free which is impressive considering the number of pets. Very quiet too, no complaints at all. Breakfast area nice, enjoyed the yogurt - no scrambled eggs or sausage though, limited fresh fruit. Highly recommended, perfect location close to downtown Savannah, Skidaway & Tybee Islands. OK, so it seems that hotels in Savannah are at a premium over the last weekend of Summer. I have stayed at La Quinta's before but this was really a bad property. The staff didn't seem to care much that the side door wouldn't open, the only ice machine in the three story building ran out of ice on Sunday morning (the other one was broken). We almost got turned down because they say Travelocity usually overbooks them - they found us a room after all. When paying for the stay, $290 with all the taxes, for two nights, felt way overpriced for the hotel. The location is so so, I didn't expect anything close to the Historic District, and there are food options in the malls around the area, but the hotel itself was filthy in the common areas, better in the rooms, which didn't help much. In summary - if you have more time to look, or can afford a little more per day, stay away. They didn't  have  King  size  room had to stay in a not so good  twin room Kathy at the front desk was charming , informative and very helpful. She was easy to talk to like an old friend !! ! At check-in, Kathy, working the front desk waited until she had finished filing her paperwork and tidied up the desk before assisting me, 4 minutes without so much as a be right with you. Shower curtain needs attention as the bathroom floor floods every time you shower. Room otherwise ok, went with low expectations as it is pet friendly without any fees. Seems to be a rough side of town, did not feel safe walking my dog around after sundown. Checkout was slow, went to desk at 8:30 and waited longer than 5 minutes without seeing staff but could hear them in back office. Returned at 9 and took 15 minutes after waiting for same staff member to wander back to the desk. Like I said, went in with low expectations and got about what was expected. Would not stay again, will pay dearly to stay at a nice facility next time. The hotel is exactly what we asked for. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. My only issue is that they ran out of parking spaces and I had to park along the back of the building. It wasn't that big of a deal, but it was kind of annoying. Staff really Nice and helpful. Hotel was okay quiet room was comfortable and air conditioner  was cold. There's a small pool and gym area. Breakfast was good create your own waffles or grab a bagle cereal for the kids.Great for a quick vacation near great food and mall. Always an excellent stay at the La Quinta in Savannah. Clean hotel, easy check in. Staff was friendly and the location was decent.
This hotel has a fantastic beach and location! Easy access to cabs or the city bus are all in walking distance. The buffets offered at the hotel were nice if you plan to eat on campus. The rooms, however were really outdated. The sliding glass door, going out of our room barely opened or at least we had to struggle. There were several other things that didn’t work right simply because of its age. They try really hard to please but until this hotel is updated, I’m sure they’ll hear more comments like this one. Not a bad stay but just disappointed in the quality. We’ve been coming here for years, as our family owned a timeshare here before Emporio purchased the building. The beachfront is impeccable, grounds and facilities lovely. However, dated rooms are suffering as they anticipate remodel (sliding doors don’t slide, fridge filthy and leaky, shower tiles appear moldy, counters chipped and stained). Murphy bed was so hard our little one cried about having to sleep there. No mattress pad was available, so they sent up a couple blankets which didn’t do much for his comfort. Some processes (seating for meals, paying by room charge in the market) are laborious and could use improvement. Also strict guidelines about bringing outside food and drink to the pool are not family friendly. The Emporio is not a top end hotel, but it is trying to be without the expense. Our room was comfortable, clean, and most importantly, a few steps off the beach and ocean. we wanted a quiet getaway, not spring madness. We were able to settle out on the beach and not hear pounding sound systems trying to entertain the crowds, just my wife and I on the beach listening to the surf and crashing waves. It was wonderful. It looked like there was pool front activities for individuals an families, we just chose to stick near the beach. The buffet food was good, and the few menu items we tasted were very good. We did choose to eat out many nights, since we did not elect the all-inclusive dining option. We would re-book here the next time we travel to Cancun. Emporio was amazing! The views were absolutely breathtaking!! I read a lot of reviews about the hotel staff stealing from room and even the safe. We made sure to leave any valuables locked inside my suitcase. Nothing was stolem during our 6 night stay. The room cleaners stopped by our room twice daily and did a great job with cleaning. The hotel is currently under construction, but this wasn’t bothersome. Our room wasn’t renovated, but everything was great quality just a bit outdated. The beach here had red flags for half of our stay. The other half they were yellow and the waves were a bit mellower. We will be back! My wife and I arrived at hotel after long journey from North Carolina---Check in desk was crowded I stood in line---Desk clerk informed me I had no reservation , it had been canceled by Expedia .How could this be I replied , I've never had any problems with Expedia reservations before and the reservation showed confirmed . Twice the desk clerk checked his computer and said you have no room .I got mad demanded to see the manager showed him the reservation for a ocean view room , he finally relented , gave me a bay view room for the 5 days--I didn't argue further as we were tired from our travels . It's a nice hotel and swim pool but resturant expensive , high winds and surf through the days we stayed there . Waste of time visiting Mexico ! cable was not very good, to many spanish channels, to many subtitles. The activites personel were very fun and very proffesionals. I definitely enjoyed the food in this place and the service staff was great! This room was wonderful and the view was amazing. I would definitely stay here again. The only negative I can think of was that the tours at the hotel were overpriced compared to the other offers we encountered while we were there. The front desk person was nice, couldn’t check in 15 min early, so we went to restaurant. All we ordered was chips and salsa and had to wait over 15 min to get help. Only stayed one night, just overall not impressed. The 6 days we stayed were very enjoyable. The pool was great and the pool staff excellent. Thanks for the bingo game we had such a good time. The staff was very nice but the hotel rooms were very dirty. It could be nicer when the construction is done, one building is new. It was hard to relax in the pool area because of construction. The staff where nice and helpful. I might come back when they are done remodeling. The staff and hotel was very accommodating. We enjoyed our stay here and will be returning! The rooms were very clean and the pool was great. Great access to the beach too! The hotel staff is super nice and waiters at the buffet are phenomenal, especially Pedro. The room was beyond of what I expected will definitely be staying there again. Awesome hotel staff, comfortable atmosphere all around, clean, family-friendly (even though I was traveling with a friend it was good for us) -- made our last leg of days in Cancun simply wonderful This is the 5th time we have stayed at Emporio - didn't do all inclusive this time and LOVED it! For what you pay, the room are nice. Was planning a trip back but noticed the price went up over $600 for the same time and type of room. Will be looking around at that cost! Most workers are very friendly and eager to help. They need some of them to train those working in the reception area and their little snack store. Any time I had to deal with them they were incredibly rude - not sure why! ? Gorgeous view and great weather Not a 5 or 4 Star Resort either. Decent and clean facilities. Stairs everywhere you go so lots of luggage is a complete hassle. Right on the beach though! Staff is friendly but pool area restaurant nachos were worse 7 eleven or any gas station. Great fitness center with quality equipment! Facilities going through renovation. Remodeled buildings are very nice, the rest is outdated. Description of the different rooms is not clear....you don't really know what you're getting until you're there. If you  want to upgrade the room, price goes up more than double! Very attentive and nice personnel though. I think that's the best asset of Emporio. I am not cheap, but neither am I super wealthy. So, when I went to Cancun with a friend we looked for the best value at the most affordable rate. Emporio knocked it out of the ballpark! We had a fantastic stay. The king suite ocean view room was perfect for us. Everything was great. Omar and his staff do a great job, from the restaurant buffet to volleyball on the perfectly cleaned beach. We were VERY please and hope to return to Emporio again soon. The hotel was great, the food was good and the staff was friendly. My only problem was when I was searching for a hotel to stay in, I searched for an all inclusive hotel. This hotel was listed within the category of all inclusive and the rate was basically a steal. I had seen this same hotel off another travel site so I went for it. I didn't realize that the offer I booked for was for only 15% off food and drinks until I got to the hotel instead of all it being included. The moral of my story is even if you see the same deal and hotels off different traveling sites, DOUBLE CHECK. I just trusted that since it was listed as all inclusive that that was what I was going to get. Regardless, it was a great trip and a nice hotel. Check in easy, but was told if I used my Amex, which I had used to confirm my reservation, the rate would be higher. Fortunately had MasterCard. Joked with the desk clerk about being assigned a Superior Room with two beds as I had requested and not a Standard Room with one bed. He assured me my reservation was being honored. Nothing Superior about the room. It had a tiny little Juliet balcony without even enough room for a chair and a strange window with shutters that looked directly out on the full balcony of an adjoin Junior Suite. Just enough space for the two of us to move around the room if we planned our moves. Clean and spacious rooms. Plenty of room and space. Had the kitchen if we decided to eat in. Comfortable stay and would stay again as well. Good hotel, nice swimming pool, great pool and beach service. Basically everything you need close. If you are looking for luxury this is not the place for you. Good price for a good hotel in a great location. It was a beutiful stay. Wr got a oceqn view room that we paid or. Staff was wonferful and very help. Check in took about 45 minutes. Everyone was very friendly and our room was ocean front! Loved it! I had a very amazing experience with this hotel. The buffet had a wide variety foods , menu changing every day. I got oceanview  apartment which had 3 beds in it , beach was wonderful, a real paradise on Earth First time in Cancun, very happy with this hotel. Staff is nice facility always clean, and the view is beautiful The service was amazing....Elias--Bellboy! !.....Santos..room care...so pleasant and kind!! and many more!! We could not have asked for a better group of employees and now friends!! Loved it! This hotel was great value for money spotless clean, staff friendly and efficient. Great location short bus ride downtown or into Cancun city. Overall a great relaxing beach and shopping holiday Excellent pool and right on beach. Breakfast is worth getting as included as it goes til 12 which is wonderful when you're on holiday. Dinner menu fairly average and the cocktails could be more inspired. Hotel very comfortable and clean. Staff great The staff were polite but need to be more friendly and helpful. If you don't speak Spanish your just ignored. We found to be bubbling along with not really knowing where to go what to do. The room was very comfortable, we had a well equiped kitchenette and spacious balcony and sitting  area. We had many staff knocking on our door in our 4 day stay, the lock checking guy, the insect spraying guy and the woman checking the room, not sure why. Rooms desperately need renovation. Oceanfront room, sliders were rusted through, we opened track broke and could never close the whole time we were there. Locks and handles broken on sliders - makeshift repairs. My daughter and I left with strange, itchy bites we suspect were bed bugs. The staff was not accommodating to our family. The first time I've ever had an unfriendly experience in Mexico and we travel there often. Thank goodness we were only there for 2 days - last minute awaiting a flight home. Any family booking a week vacation here would be very disappointed. Four adults and two children 4 and 6 yo had a wonderful time and fit comfortably in the suite. The pool has an area for small children w a big pirate boat that has slides. My 4 and 6 yo loved it. All of the rooms are ocean view but only A side rooms w kitchenette open to balcony. Ms Fatima in the kids club is great. It closes from1-3:30 each day and reopens to 4:50. The hotel rooms are dated but clean. The ocean in front of the hotel is choppy w red and yellow flags the whole time we stayed march 25-30. We still went in but small children benefit from calmer waters. We had breakfast included which was good. I was not impressed w food enough to miss out the all inclusive which was $63 per person not 4yo and 6 yo per day. We took the bus to Walmart and bought food and cooked dinner two days and ate out the rest which was perfect. Lunch is usually included in excursions but if u plan to relax at the hotel everyday then do the all inclusive Our suite was in an amazing location, literally nothing in front of us but beach. We had a 1 bedroom in the M building. All of the beds, including the Murphys in the living room were very comfortable. Our balcony was huge. Our room had sole access to the shared balcony. The next room had a slider but it was locked and we never saw the privacy screen opened, so it didn't present any discomfort. When we arrived, Gabriel helped us to our room and gave us great info on how to take the bus down to Soriano to buy groceries and then take a cab back. The full kitchen was great since we had young kids and didn't get the meal plan. The little store inside Emporio was definitely nice to have. The service at the beach and pool bars was great. Gaspar took very good care of us whenever he saw us at the beach. The mixed drinks like margaritas/pina coladas weren't good. They made a mean Paloma though. The food from those spots was pretty standard, the kids loved the cheese sticks. They take good care of the grounds and have an attentive beach lifeguard. The towel service was odd. They provide cards that you exchange for towels but only have two towel huts. The pool one closes right at 10pm and the beach hut has limited towels. A couple of times, there were no towels at either hut. We tried the kids club but whenever we went, they had a sign that they were at the beach. Our trip was in Isla Mujeras for the week, but due to our early morning flight  we had to stay one night in Cancun to make our early morning flight. The hotel is being remodeled right now and we were lucky enough to stay in the newly renovated tower,  the room was very nice,  comfortable beds, nice bathroom,  nice view of the pool area. The room was great,   I just wasn't thrilled with the rest of the hotel,  maybe when all the renovations are complete,  it will be much nicer. We had lunch by the pool restaurant and Hemberth our waiter was very nice and provided great service but the wait for food was extremely long due to most likely short staff in the kitchen,  not our waiters fault and extremely expensive,  and the pool bar was extremely expensive as well. Also there is no outdoor Jacuzzi in the pool area,  I really expected one of a hotel this large,  the beach is quite a hike,  it was about 5 or 6 flights of stairs to get down to the beach  which of course you had to hike back up to get to the hotel/pool area. It was a lot of stairs.....      We did eat at the restaurant across the street,  the Captains Cove! The food and service were excellent! Was very nice people and very friendly  made my family have very good experience at hotel we ready back The bathroom vent was dropping black stuff into the shower. If you used the kitchen utensils or dishes you must clean them or be charged extra, so I wonder are they ever cleaned correctly by staff? Yuk! The staff is very nice, but that doesn't help that our TV wasn't working, the bedding was stained and it smelled horrible. Great hotel and staff. Ask about current construction before you select room. Great cozy hotel! This is not a meat-market singles pool party like many other Cancun resorts. Family friendly place, right at the beach. I'd definitely recommend this it. AC worked perfectly, the staff was superb, buffets had large selection. the 24hrs convenience store was a huge plus as well. I would probably do it again I just didn't think Cancun was all that as a whole. The lobby supervisor was not very easy to deal with and I really had a rough time talking with him. Nice Hotel. Access to a few restaurants and convenience store. Walking distance from public beach. I like the location in the tourist activity the room was very clean Great location and very nicely renovated. The other facility is still under construction. Also there is some steps to and from beach with no handicap access. Nicer hotel than expected. Lots of stairs to go to the beach. Elevator to go to rooms. Service was go and goood parking for cars. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Had a wonderful time. Service was great would recommend it to anyone who would love a beautiful location Beach front, awesome pool excellent service. Your staff was every professional, courteous, helpful   great staff. A good place to stay friendly people always welcome you Threw the door We had to stay one night here after we had a problem with another hotel we stayed in. We were well taken care of during our time there. Elegant hotel staff was very professional and everything perfect Our room was right next to the building being refurbished. they are turning large time share rooms into smaller hotel rooms. The hotel it taking a large condo and making 4 smaller room out of it the noise of the jackhammers is horrible. I did not know this when I booked it. The construction started at 8am and continued all day until 7pm. This hotel was great value for money spotless clean, staff friendly and efficient. Great location short bus ride downtown or into Cancun city. Overall a great relaxing beach and shopping holiday
Room was very nice. Air shuts off around 2 am though so it gets rather warm. Room service was good and room cleaning was as well. Red Chinese restaurant was closed for private party so we didn't get to eat there. There are several good Chinese places close by though. No balcony in the Suites, only in older hotel. Suites is much nicer though. Check in took a little longer than it should because they said they couldn't couldn't find my reservation and insisted I call my booking service to contact them. Turns out all the check in desk had to do is call their own reservation people and it was there all along. Pleasnt I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews, but we had a great time. Seyi at the front desk was amazingly helpful. When we requested extra towels and an iron they arrived promptly. The Sunday lunch buffet was delicious. Dirty hotel and in need of modernisation It was generally good. However, they have to review the policy on providing breakfast for just one of the room occupants. The rooms in the Garden section are a bit dated. That section is begging for a face-lift. Very well located hotel in Victoria Island with a lot of restaurants and bars in it. This is the place to be in Lagos to go out. The hotel has 4 different properties. I stayed at Eko main building. Room is fine, but little old. The service is very bad, unfriendly staff. It was great stay,  lots of food options but a little pricey. The staff where friendly and helpful. Excellent safe and friendly place to stay for people like me who are first timers to Nigeria. Had to pay for my room again despite already paying via Hotels.com prior to arrival I also got embarrassed in front of my guess and asked to leave the room to make this second payment. Another colleague on the reception later apologised to me inconvenience cause but I hestitated due to my excellent past experiences As far as my room and the common areas they were great. The restaurant staff for the Mexican restaurant were extremely inattentive. The buffet for guests had a great variety of food, however, one staff member told me that I had a free meal with my stay and urged me to enjoy my free meal. I told her I didn't recall a complimentary meal and she corrected me showing me that based on my room type I automatically got a free meal. However, when I went to check out I had noticed a food charge on there. I explained the situation to the front desk and despite how much money I had otherwise spent with the hotel, the front desk was rude and unaccomodating taking my deposit money without my consent to use it toward this fraudulent charge. The Manager on duty was cold and rude and addressed the male I was with instead of me, the hotel patron which I think was a reflection on how misogynistic their male front desk staff is. This experience left a really bad taste in my mouth. Stayed at the Eko Hotel Signature ( the newest section of the hotel). Excellent facility as it is new. Great location, lots of activities and events take place at the hotel. Good service, pleasant staff that is eager to please. Amenities were nice. Breakfast included in daily fees. However, restaurant prices were outrageous. Suggest having your breakfast within the hotel, but lunch and dinner in very nice and affordable restaurants within walking distance of the hotel such as L’afrique Reataurant, Terra Kulture restaurant and Lounge, Yellow Chilli. Overall, a very fine experience. Eko hotel is completely run down. We only stayed one night even though we had 3 days booking. It was an unpleasant experience. I will not be staying here again. Ever. only one night, but is good. the pool and bar is nice Customer service is non-existent...poor quality of service from day of check-in. The best experience was received from the spa/salon staff. Thank you Jennifer It didn’t feel like a 5 star hotel, it has a great location but the room wasn’t that quality. I felt like I was in a 3 star hotel and I should have just gone for a cheaper option. Great experience in general but with some bath room leakages. No hot water  Warn out bedding  Overall dissatisfied The Main building has been refinished but the old bathtub and shower-heads remain. The grounds of this hotel are great. Tennis, basketball, large pool and a great gym. Best hotel on Victoria Island. The grounds and pool area of the Eko are beautiful. Sadly, the rooms do not offer the same level of comfort. The rooms are a bit dated and infrastructure is a bit tired (generator, water lines). Super fast internet! Staff were great and very friendly. Ample security around the hotel as well. Dining at the hotel offers a few choices and the prices were not extremely overinflated (excluding the buffet as it was quite expensive). Pleasant, comfortable stay in this hotel, particularly in the Signature building of the hotel complex. Room overlooking the Atlantic ocean gave a lovely view. Peaceful, quiet, high brow neighborhood in the sprawling Lagos metropolis. Wide range of dining experiences within the hotel complex. Good enough for our purpose, but mattress needs assessing.. way too uncomfortable and hard! Decent hotel with great staff and very good location for our purposes This hotel is very outdated and needs major refurbishment. The rooms are very disappointing and not value for money. The overall grounds, pool, restaurants and bars are nice. The 2 things that stood out as a positive is they have a very nice gym and the roof top bars is really cool. The rooms and amenities in the room and corridors leading to room are very old and run down. If you enjoy the hotel experience don't stay here. The Signature building is better but Gardens and Main building are terrible!
I stayed in the new building and the room was better than I expected. It had a fantastic view overlooking the beach. I've rated this hotel based not on being the best hotel I've ever stayed but I've rated it on value for money and I feel that relative to the cost of the room this was a fantastic hotel. Working our way down the coast of Vietnam. The Seagull is in a great location on the beach, central to walking throughout town. Rooms are large and comfortable bed however, they have old carpets that need to be replaced in the rooms. We first got a room with two beds, phone didn’t work and wifi didn’t work well. The next day they moved us to a King bed room and phone/wifi worked. We were there for e days and enjoyed the town. Hotel is a bit dated, but the room was clean. The view was good. Really nothing to complain about. Stay at this hotel for 2 nights. Good location being right in front of the beach. Would come back when next in Qui Nhon! The Seagull hotel Quy Nhon is well worth a visit if you are travelling through Vietnam.It is very good value for a hotel of this quality. The resort is mainly frequented by Vietnamese and we got a lot of attention as there were few westerners visiting. The hotel is fine a little bit dated but the rooms are clean and the staff on reception and the pool bar are very friendly,directly on the lovely beach so easy access to the  promenade Breakfast buffet was nice,  a good omelet and large variety of especially Vietnamese options. Beautiful view and proximity to the beach. Western dinner food was marginal. For room service after repeatedly trying to call room service,  restaurant and office  all with no answer I then took the room service menu to the front desk which referred me to the restaurant which then took my order. I went back to my room to then receive my meal. Group was encouraged to stay at the 4 star hotel.very dated, rooms musty smelling. Decent breakfast.
The room and bed was clean, beautiful balcony view of Kwun Yam Wan beach, and very friendly staff who helped us with local choice of restaurant. The air conditioner for the spring weather was a bit cold. The shower was strong but looks old and needs some modernization. We had our room on 5th floor and very near elevator, but lucky the hotel was not noisy or busy at all. Good stay. Nice balcony view very relaxing vacation with my family in Cheung Chau Warwick hotel. The food in hotel's restaurant is very good and price is reasonable. Only one comment is the quilt is too thin for the cold weather.
While right off the highway, which was nice, we expected to have a bit of road noise and were delighted to not hear much at all! The best was comfortable, check in was smooth. Breakfast was ok, cereal, bagels and waffles. It would have been nice to have some protien. We only stayed one night but we would definitely go back. Good place to stay. The only downside is, the door won't locked! I talked to the employee at this hotel. She said they are trying to figure it out. Every thing good except carpet in room needs shampoo or replaced Time for a new carpet, otherwise very nice. Nice room and service. The area was not all the best but the surrounding area was great. Cori at the front desk is the sole reason that I am a repeat customer. She remembers exactly what we need ahead of our check in. It’s nice to be treated like our business matters. The front desk person at night was very friendly and professional. I would return just because of how she treated everyone coming in. The location is easy to find and convenient to most of the attraction. Room is spacious and clean. Room was not as nice as we expected Easy to find. Quick check in. Clean room. Spa water a bit dirty. Should need shower before enter spa. Need to replace daily The hotel was nice, beds were not very comfortable. Staff was very friendly. Our room was a little stuffy. Very nice stay. Room was more than I expected for the good price I paid. Me and my husband were very comfortable. Only thing is there is not a lot of breakfast options just waffles, cereal, and bagels/toast. Other than that I had no complaints and the staff was very friendly. Basic hotel, stayed one night for a concert. Rooms weren’t bad. Front desk lady was super nice and helpful, really liked her. Downfall was it was pretty noisy. People in the hall talking very loudly and every time the people above us moved we could here it. The stay was pleasant, staff very friendly and helpful. It was good to have breakfast on the property. Nice place for the price. Great breakfast We rarely do spur of the moment trips but we decided to this weekend and with limited availabilities we chose the America's Best Inn Lincoln City. I yelped and read all the google reviews I could before reserving my room. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we checked in. The hotel staff was very nice! The lobby was clean. It looks like they're doing a bit of renovations which is a plus! The room and bathroom were clean. We showed up after 8pm and it was very quiet! Quiet throughout the night as well. The only downside was the breakfast but we had planned to go out so it worked for us. The hotel was wonderful. Close to the small shops and restaurants at the beach. I loved the spacious bathroom and I could actually lay down in the bath tub.. And the bed , I just melted into it and slept like I haven't gotten to in years. Plus I loved that the laundry room was open early but stayed open late for the people who don't get up during the first half of the day. Everything was clean . Corie was good at check-in. Friendly and pleasant. The next day we had no water, the breakfast was low budget and Jan, the desk attendant was rude and impersonal about our inconveniences. I will not stay here again and we will be sending our review to Yelp and the America's Best corporate. I will also advise friends and family not to stay here. My only problem was check in just make sure if you use expedia make sure you have a credit card, this was a gift to me and was paid for with expedia, however the motel required a $50.00 refundable security deposit on a credit card, since I don't have a credit card I could not do it, even though the motel was paid in full, finally we worked it out do to Jan helping, took about 3 hours, not pleasant for me or motel. In Lincoln City for a concert at Chinook Winds. This hotel was clean, convenient and reasonably priced. Over-all a great weekend! good service for the price of the room would stay there again no problem I would recommend this to a friend due to location. Upon arrival, the room was semi-clean and that night you can hear everything next to you , very thin walls and it kept us up through the night. This is a fairly convenient motel on the east side of 101 with very reasonable rates. very convenient to the various attracions in Lincoln City. Old, dirty, no coffee in room, loud rooms, looked nothing like photos It’s a good, clean room. The front desk is helpful and the breakfast was not the biggest, but it was certainly good Friendly staff. Didn't realize there was a sauna and hot tub. Had breakfast, basic selection, kept stocked. I had stayed here before but I hadn’t had a good experience. This time it was! Hotel staff was nice, room was super nice and comfortable! Not very helpful staff, room and hallway smelled like smoke. No elevator. Will not be back. No clock or coffee machine and bed made us roll to centre The outside doesn't look like much however it's warm and friendly on the inside 15 minutes after checking in, someone else had walked into my room WHILE I WAS CHANGING and said they had just been given the same room. Both times I tried to open the door, the key did not work and I had to go down to the front desk. I feel very violated and am not happy about this experience There were strands of hair on the bed sheets&pillow cases. Bed Sheets have not changed from previous guests. Asked to change a room which has the same problem. Asked for clean sheets & pillow cases and changed them ourselves. Night staff at front desk was friendly. Day staff at front desk didn't give me a copy of credit card void for $50 deposit until I asked for it. Our rooms where very clean and large .Hotel staff was very nice and professional . Do not stay here. Sick overflowed and stuffed up. We were kept all night from the room above us running, walking, talking, fu... All night. You could hear everything...it was really bad! There was carpet rolled and left in the hallway...bug bites from the bed! The hotel had two lamps in our room that were fire hazards the room smelled like mold it wasn't very clean and it was in need of a remodel. The hotel tell charged me a $50 refundable hold on my debit card for smoking in the room or pets which we did neither of the charge went through on my debit and I had to call the hotel to have them reverse the charge they kept my money for five days. This is the first time I've stayed in a hotel on Travelocity that is been so terrible My daughter and I each thought the other had made reservations for an overnight stay at the coast! As it turns out, neither of us did. We were looking for a decently priced clean motel for a Friday night, at about 5:30 pm. We lucked out after calling several other places, when we contacted America's Best Inn in Lincoln City. The person who answered the phone was gracious and helpful and was able to book us a room. The price was reasonable, the room with 2 queen beds was clean and smelled nice, and the beds and pillows were comfortable. We had coffee and a coffee maker in our room, a microwave and a small refrigerator... all CLEAN! To make it even better, the next morning we found the breakfast area! What a treat to find water, coffee, juice, bagels, cereal, milk, and much more. We will definitely stay there again, and highly recommend it. It's not on the beach, but it's close enough. :-) Nice facility with friendly front desk staff - great location. We stayed in room 110, they were re-molding the room above us, it was about 2AM before we could sleep It was ok for the price we paid for. But wasn't expecting to pay $30.00 for a deposit, and may get it back in the afternoon when we checked out. Never got a receipt for our stay. Staff was ok. The rooms are pleasant with frig.microwaves and large baths. They have rooms with firm or soft mattresses so ask them for the one you prefer. Staff is very friendly and willing to help with any of your needs. Great place for a good price. Great service @ counter check in, advised great restaurant! ! Pluses : price, spa /sauna, cleanliness, location, bed, staff. Minuses : breakfast, noisy heater, needs update fairly soon, no room coffee maker. The staff was great, very helpful. We needed a room quickly and they were able to accommodate us. Very quiet. Friendly staff. Very helpful. Breakfast every morning with coffee. Easy check in and out. I would go there again At first the staff was less then helpful. The door to the room did not lock and anyone could just walk in the room. Then the room keys did not work and it took the front desk 4 try's to fix it. Breakfast should include sausage or bacon or some type meat. VERY CLEAN, WAS CLOSE TO THE BEACH, THE SAUNA AND JACUZZI EXCELLENT AND THE STAFF WERE PROFESSIONAL. There was no elevator and for a blind person &  75 year old person  both of us were winded every time we went up or down. We were expected to wash before going into the hot tub...no shower. The room for breakfast was very small. Room was exceptionally clean. Can't often say that. We enjoyed this affordable hotel that is only about 7 blocks from the beach and very close to local shops and restaurants. No elevator. Room was clean and neat. A/c worked well. Close to the shopping areas. Could expand the breakfast options Bed was comfortable. We were given a later checkout time. We were impressed with the attractiveness of a discounted hotel. We will be back. A nice hotel for the price. The only detriment were the pillows. 2 people and 3 pillows was s mismatch and the pillows were hard. Nice getaway from our kids. Would’ve preferred a king size bed, but that was my fault, not the hotel. Breakfast was a bit lacking. That would be my only complaint. Front desk gal super helpful. Rooms in need of updating. Front desk staff was great and super sweet! Gave me ideas on what to do in town! Only suprise was that if you book on orbitz, the hotel charges you a refundable $50 just to make sure you don’t do silly stuff while here. So be prepared for that :) They charged me  a. &50.00 for deposit Whenl Leaving didn’t want to credit me. They would do later. I told I wasn’t leaving without the credit. She wasn’t happy with me, but I waited. The. Didn’t want to me a receipt she had to copy the void slip. Meanwhile no credit to my account yet. This could be difficult for some who don’t extra money in the account. I don’t recommend This hotel There is a sauna/spa which is great when it is cold like it was this weekend. They also have breakfast for free, which I thought was a plus. It was peaceful and quiet at the hotel and don't have anything bad to say for our stay. Walls were dirty, shower did not work properly... it would not drain... had something that looked like mild on the ceiling in restroom.... over all furniture was dated and really worn... not a comfortable experience. Never ever would go here again. Big waste of money...kreepy
This was once a wonderful hotel but it is going down hill rapidly. I just completed a trip into the interior of Mexico and returning to this hotel as my home base 3 times. Twice the refrigerator didn't work and had to be replaced. Once the coffee pot didn't work and another time the clock didn't work. The restaurant could be a Saturday Night Live Spoof. I would order Vodka and get rum after waiting 12 minutes for my drink when there were no other tables. They didn't have a corkscrew to open the wine. On one evening they couldn't find the key to open the liquor cabinet.the food is slow and bad but it is cheap if you want slow bad food. I feel terrible for the people working there. They are untrained and understaffed. I don't think this will be a Holiday Inn much longer. I'm going to have to find a different hotel. While the location of this one is perfect nothing else is. You can’t find a better location. Right on Juarez street, 1 block away from the cathedral, in the heart of downtown you have everything at your fingertips. All the food, shopping, entertainment, and attractions that you can think of are within walking distance. We traveled with a 10 month old, getting to places was not an issue. We went to the zoo, 10 min taxi ride. The hotel itself is very spacious with hardwood floors. Quiet and modern. Room service is delicious and speedy. Restaurant on site was also a great option to start the day. Very very happy and pleased with the stay. We arrived at 6am and front desk allowed us to check in early, which was a huge relief. I can’t say enough great things about this place, I will definitely stay here again. The hotel did not feel very secure. It seemed like anyone could just walk in and no one would ask if they were staying there. The mini fridge did not work. The door latch was missing. Excelente hotel nice staff very good service n food nice view close to downtown it was a well worth stay due to the rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. it was home away from home Wonderful experience staying at this hotel. Very clean beds were comfortable Customer service is excellent,rooms are very clean 5 stars hotel. Good location, walking distance to City Center and stores. Hotel has a cafe and a restaurant in the hotel which is handy. However, the proximity of other restaurants and cafes is good to have. Room was clean and spacious. I recommend it and will go back. Nice location within walking distance to the Lucha libre arena, Arena Coliseo. Clean room and comfortable beds. Right on brotha! We had mistakenly booked one day earlier than our arrival and we're charged full price for a room that was not used in a hotel that was not fully booked. We felt there might be some way to split the costs of that error. Thx, Dennis Everything was good except for the room the ac was not working or the mini fridge Great location at the center of the historical district with in walking distance of all the sights. Staff was very helpfull. Nothing fancy bit clean and good location. The parking was a problem. great staff, great location! It was a good clean hotel, just the linens were old and dirty. Good strong wifi. The staff was not very  friendly and front desk girls were very short. The Service are good, kindnees personal. Small bathroom. Very centrally located,in historical district, clean and very comfortable, large rooms. Staff great, made arrangements for tours, English spoken. Great for a 4-day weekend. Rooms are cleaned  Staff are friendly  Location to downtown closer My only complaint about the stay was the bathroom. The toilet was in a bad placement. The shower was uncomfortable. Overall the breakfast and staff made it a comfortable stay. It was good over all. They need to work more on the maintenance department on the parking, hallway an stairs to make sure it looks more clean. But you can beat their location  it was a good experience overall. The room was comfortable and clean. The buffet breakfast was good. Thank you. This place sucks. They stole my money. They booked the room for the wrong day. I did not had a room when I got there and they didn't refund my money. We traveled with our 3-month-old and had a great experience. Crib was simple and perfect, staff helped us call U.S. bank free of charge, and restaurant/room service was delicious and economical. Excelent , its a great hotel i like too much. When ill come again to Guadalajara im going to stay at the same place thanks
A great hotel for a one-night business trip. Central, modern, good value. Good price compared to hotels in Derendorf. Tip: sign up to the Accor loyalty programme for faster wireless and multiple device access. Great hotel good great staff clean and comfortable  rooms Very good hotel in the Seestern area, very close to the U-Bahn and airport. Staff were very good and attentive, would  recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a hotel in this area. Super friendly staff; we stayed there at Christmas Eve as it's close to family but it's in the middle of a series of offices so it has very limited charm
We got threatened 3 times to get kicked out and that were to check out and leave us on the streets just because 2 mates who were also on holiday kept coming round, in the booking it didn't state NO FRIENDS ALLOWED IN ROOM, the man who owned it was the most spiteful, arrogant idiot I've ever came across in my life, I wouldn't stay here again just because of him if you paid me! went on a stag do, but wanted to stay in a hotel away from the main strip of Magaluf, so it would be quieter. Hotel clean and good value for money, good air conditioning and quiet even though restaurant and supermarket close by. It is basic hotel but sufficient for my need as I only wanted to sleep in it.No food served in hotel, but plenty of places to eat close by. Great hostal great location just might be a bit loud around summer time Absolutely perfect location if you want to be close to the main strip or the beach. I've heard a lot of bad things about hostels, but after seeing this one, I'm not sure what anyone is talking about. I give Jakiton a 4.5 out of 5. Only thing missing was breakfast. Stayed here for the every year for 3 years on girly weekends it's a fab little hotel , housekeeping every day , air conditioning plus a ceiling fan .only thing negative is that there's no pool but 5 mins from beach, would defo recommend staying here Great place in the off season to relax by the beach and enjoy the island. The Hotel was quite basic but was in a good location. My room was cleaned every day and towels changed. Yes and coffee making facilities in the room. Ideal for a couple or single traveller.
We were unable to access WiFi the entire weekend. The pool was shut down due to chemical issue. The fumes were so bad ours eyes burned all night. The carpet throughout looked like is needed replaced. Appeared to be needed repairs throughout hotel. They don’t offer a breakfast in the morning. The room was very clean and comfortable, but the microwave looked like it was sliding off the wall. It was very quiet. Staff was courteous. The activity room was fun for our kids. Could probably use more to do in there. Beach access was great. Close to wonderful restaurants. Price was nice. Staff wasn’t too pushy about investing in time share. Overall, it was all right for a quick weekend away for my children. I wouldn’t recommend this resort for a romantic getaway. Initial room given was smoking although we booked a nonsmoking, when requested for a new room, front desk suggested if we want a fabreeze spray to remove the smell !!! Eventually we were given another room but bed is so uncomfortable and when you sit at the edge, it produces a sound that’s like a drum. we can hear the kids in the other room screaming and carpet is sticky. It was raining and there are puddles on the hallway going to the room. Staff are friendly though which is only the best thing. I expected a nice experience with my wife. Instead the room that I initially booked, 1 king size bed, magically turned into a 2 queen/full size bed..then I was offered a package at the concierge desk, since we were a diamond member we were offered by the supervisor a 55 min updated presentation for gift cards of 200...which by stepping foot inside the building we were told some b.s. that now if we wanted to sell our poi he it would be based on the value of today which was 8.99 instead of what we originally purchased them for. I didn't ask to go to the diamond resort office on 34th st. Marketing sent us...and back to the hotel...There were stains on the standard size pillow that were left on the king size bed (the new room we were switched into) and the bolt lock did not work on the door. The bathroom was tiny. Just the worst. Def do not recommend this resort nor diamond resorts at all to become a member. When they said the parking garage had tight turns, they weren't joking. That is the only thing about this hotel that made me nervous. After parking and heading into the hotel, I was skeptical about the concrete floors outside of my room. After thinking about it, I understand it's practicality. Once I opened the door to my room, I was very pleasantly surprised! My one bedroom suite had everything I needed for my stay. Very well laid out and comfortable. When I first checked in, I had trouble connecting my Apple product to the wifi. The front desk gave me a number to call and for whatever reason, the hotel phone wouldn't connect to the toll free call and I had to use my cell phone to get through. Once I got tech services on the phone, they took care of me quickly and solved the issue. The only negative I have is the lack of outlets. But that is pretty common with hotels. I will have to remember to bring a power strip the next time I stay here. Yes, I will definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone interested in a reasonably prices hotel right on the boardwalk. The outside waiting room is misleading to the rest of hotel. The room which was suppose to be a deluxe suite was nothing like any of the pictures. It was too small to accomodate 6 people. The carpets in the hall ways needed major cleaning. Bathroom small and cramped. Could of at least had a bath and 1/2 in the room. We were on our honeymoon, just got off the road from a 2 hour drive and I was stopped about seeing a time share presentation for 2 hours in the next 2 days. Carpet old and nasty needs to be removed, furniture old and needs to be replaced. Best i have ever stayed will be back.love the hot tub pool stall and room I love this motel. Will stay here again. It was nice and quiet. The staff was very very helpful. They did not have a record of me even reserving the room. Attendant gave me such a hard time. It was hard to get to the hotel due to road block. Just had an awful experience I have been going to Beach Quarters since it was built but for the last few years, it has been hit or miss with them. Although summer visits are obviously more enjoyable with the rooftop poolside bar/grill and boardwalk amenities, I also like to visit year around thanks to the indoor pool/hot tub. Very nice just need more work into it not the room but the hallway and the hallway doors I paid extra on Expedia for a king size bed and when I got to the hotel they gave us two doubles (romantic right)? It’s the middle of January but apparently there were no other king size rooms available. Hotel was disgusting. Old out dated smelled like cigarettes. Roach in coffee filters. Sticky counter tops with crumbs on it. Front desk slow and I waited forever to check in. Found roaches in kitchen when went to set coffee pot up. Call front desk to have someone come spray they never did. I called 2more times. Killed 2 more roaches left them on stove. Lots of babies in itensils drawer. Room paid in advance thats why we stayed. we stay at this hotel for our family vacation every year and it has never let us down! The fitness center has a sauna and steam room. The staff is friendly and accommodating. We get the room with the Jacuzzi tub and the kids love it more than the downstairs hot tub! Lucky to get newly remodeled room- enjoyed beds and suite arrangement. Great exercise room(s) Very tight parking garage-as all hotels around there Nice hotel for money. Staff was excellent. Comode broken on arrival and they promptly moved us to another room. Only real complaint is that the parking garage is very difficult to navigate. Extremely tight turning radius from one floor to another and narrow spots. Never seen anything quite like it. Staff warns you about it and informs you of off site parking which I would recommend. This hotel was pretty cool. The only thing I did not like is how they asked us about reserving for another trip then they left a note under our door then they called us right before we checked out. The room was nice. The beds were small but comfortable. I felt the hotel was generally in disrepair. It had many things being fixed, really no added amenities. No food, parking difficult. When I arrived I had to wait at the front desk for about 20 minutes and actually had to call the main company to call the hotel to get someone to come to the front desk. I ended up booking an extra night and they made me pay another resort fee which was a one time payment that I ended up paying twice. They also took a security deposit of $100 dollars that I never got back. When I call about it I either get hung up on or a live advisor never picks up the phone. The hotel was overall nice but because of this I would never stay here again. It was a good stay I just could not take a hot shower. My whole shower started shaking when i turned it to hot. The hotel was great, the only thing that I hated was the parking garage. It was very very TIGHT. A lot of times it took me backing up 2 or 3 times just to make a turn. Hotel is old and is in need of a serious update. Rooms were OK and in pretty good shape. Pull out couch bed was very comfortable Another amazing stay, it was our son 13th birthday and the maintenance man who fixed our broken microwave brought him a small gift. The rest of the staff was awesome as well Fantastic accomodations. Beautiful ocean view from the room's balcony. This was a great resort nice room very clean, bed wasn't that comfortable only thing I didn't like was that it was outdated and we had a problem getting our door to latch. Friendly staff! Great location! Will definitely be back! Upon arriving we were greeted very friendly but as we began to sign in the situation changed. The front desk became rude and would not accept cash. What place does not accept cash? The rest of the stay was fine. Its is in a good area. Some of the lights in the room didn’t work. There was a hole in the bathroom ceiling.. The hot water barely worked!! And they didn’t even clean our room!! And they try to charge us $100 for a security fee!! I wouldn’t recommend the property or the hotel or the chain to anybody!! Just awful for the amount of money I spent to stay there!! ! I booked reservation through Travelocity....evidently wrong thing to do. When I made reservations, I was booking a room with King bed, well when we arrived to our room, two full beds. I called front desk to see if there was a mistake and they said since I booked through a third party vendor they could not help me. They could give me a reservation number to call around to see if there was another hotel in the Diamond Resort, well I make a reservation for a reason, and it's not to call around once we get there. We stayed at Beach Quarters several years ago and was very pleased, but not a good experience this time. In need of upgrades and cleaning!!! ! This hotel is pretty nice. It is a little outdated but has some nice updates that have been made. It has spacious balconies. The parking garage like others have said is a nightmare. I drive a very small SUV and am surprised that I made it out alive. There is a lot that is across the street behind the Howard Johnson and is shared with Turtle Cay. This lot is very nice and we parked there after one trip into that terrible garage. I don't care for the fact that you can't see the car from the hotel but you can't see the car if it is in the garage either and you're guaranteed door dings if you can manage to get in and out in one piece. The only other complaint is that the pool towels in our room were dirty. Everything else was cleaned and maintained. Overall, we would consider staying again. This is the second time I've stayed here and the first time, there were not sheets on the bed and no towels in the room. This time, when I entered the room, someone else's things were in the room and the TV was on. When we returned to the front desk, they did apologize and gave us another room. When we got to the room, there were fingerprints all over the mirrors and glass doors. The towels in the bathroom did not look fresh, they looked as though someone had thrown them on the rack. Also, it was very noisy in the hotel during our stay. Damaged 2 vehicles in parking garage upon departure. No signage stating size restrictions. Full size trucks and suvs cannot park in the garage without damage upon exiting. Once you are in you are stuck. The hotel is very clean. BUT the parking garage is horrible. I'm a good driver and scratched my car side on the way down. The turns are too sharp. I was heart broken .. I have a new car ! They have what looks like cut open pool noodles on the sharp corners .. I still got scraped. They have over flow parking across the street. Trust me ... It's worth it. :(. The heat didn't work in three of the rooms they switched us to . The refrigerator was dirty and rooms are not spacious at all . My wife and kids had a ball in the indoor pool. The kids also enjoyed the game room. Pool area is Unsafe, tile floor is Very slippery wet, I was afraid of falling and couldn't bring grand kids here for that reason The good: - Rooms were clean even though the building interior and room accessories looks older - Suitable for low budget families if you reserve a suit - Impeccable view of the ocean from your living room and balcony - Comfortable bed  The not-so-good: - 10.00 AM check-out and 4.00 PM check-in. So you are paying daily rate for only 16 hours of stay. - Really old doors, fridge, shower etc. Doors operate with great difficulty. Fridge had some rusting on it. - Power outlets are at a premium. Most of them are unreachable or unyielding - Resort fee is universal whether you use their facilities or not. - No free breakfast This place was awful!!!! First off we paid for the room on Orbitz, but when we tried to check out they charged us AGAIN for the room! Now we have to jump through all these hoops to get reimbursed. They room it’s self was not much to write home about. The toilet was in this Tony little space, felt like I was using the restroom in a coffin. The shower/tub was separate from the toilet area and basically in the middle of the room with a flimsy shower curtain as your only privacy. The lock on the patio door was busted and old so multiple time the door went flying open. What an icy cold surprise in the middle of the night! When we checked in there were piles of dirty laumdry all over the hallways and we had to lift our luggage over them to get to our room. The next morning the piles were still there! I don’t think you could call this place a “resort”, it’s about par of one of the cheaper motels down on the ocean front. Not worth the stay....or even having to pay TWICE the price!!! ! Staff was very friendly. ........................................................................................................................................................ Great place, great location, nice family rooms. WiFi speed is slow however, who cares about WiFi while visiting beach. One thing, I would complaint is check in (4 pm) and check out timings (10 am), which leaves very less effective time for beach location. Who comes to beach at 4 o'clock in the evening !!! I wish this timings were more standard like other hotels (3 pm and 12 pm). tub was dirty other than that excellent on cleanliness Walking distance to restaurants #10 Costumer service # 4 Close to beach #10 Room cleanses #8 Pool bar #3 Over all experience #9 Ity was not a good one. First t of all the room that I booked, I didn't get the room that I booked. Iso of one king size bed, I got two double beds. I didn't get the balcony that I order nor the studio\\ room that I originally booked. This hotel was perfectly situated on a quiet stretch of oceanfront. The rooms were nicely set up and well equipped. I was extremely impressed with the beach towels the staff had readily available. The staff was very hospitable. Convenient location to most of what you would want/need. Rooms were nice but bed and pillows not the most comfortable. However, would say it's slightly better than average rating and recommend. Check in was extremely slow other than that the staff was nice..i ask for a room that would connect with my family a month a head of time ...my family was on the 2nd floor while i was on the 7th floor... The room was not what I booked. I booked 1 king bed & was put in a room w/ 2 double (maybe queen) beds. The bed was a little small for my liking. Also the AC didn't cool the room to my liking. Hotel needs renovation. Paint peeling off. Bathroom needs cmplete makeover. Bedsheets had stains on them but the manager took care of us. Amenities are great. Excellent service throughout my stay. Very friendly staff and prompt followup  from receptionist to make sure our request was fulfilled. Overall, expierience was good,however it has been a many years since I last stayed in a hotel that did not provide a small breakfast and room make up Dailey. I would have appreciated those very common amenities. The parking garage is hard to maneuver and it is different to go outside to get to your rooms but it was a nice room with a balcony on the ocean side The highlight of Beach Quarters is the value. What we paid was easily worth the nice room, kitchenette, location and view. I would highly consider coming back. The thing to keep in mind while staying there is it is not a hotel. No breakfast, no daily room cleaning, no re-stocking of clean towels, wash rags, etc.... A couple times throughout the week we would run into staff and ask for more towels and generally could help ourself when we needed wash rags or more soap. The staff was all courteous and friendly. The indoors pools were great for our children. The sauna and workout rooms were excellent. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the exercise room and saw all the equipment. It is definitely not your standard hotel treadmill and bike gym. Downside; Parking is extremely tight in the garage. I would not recommend a full-size SUV or truck as the turns are three point turns. Check-in was inconvenient. I arrived at 7pm and no rooms were ready. I was promised a call on my cell phone and was asked by staff to grab a bite to eat somewhere to kill time. The call never came. I returned about 90 minutes later to an available room. We got off to a rough start, but again as I mentioned earlier, I would strongly consider coming back. Thank you.
Beautiful hotel been there twice. Disappointed when we got there because they put us in a room not in the main area where I expected. Three women in the last room where there was really no other visitors there.Was told that was going to a different spot because I had made my reservations through Expedia. Three women in the very last room in the area with nobody else around us. When they got my review complaining about this they moved us to the main area. The food is incredible the Staff is amazing. For the price, I would stay in other hotels in Antigua. This place has beautiful grounds, a great pool (which is slightly heated but not enough that we could stay in it for more than 45 minutes or so) some lovely tables looking out at the pool to eat at. Would be great for kids as they have parrots (who are also quite loud) and sometimes a magician on weekends as they throw a pretty large fancy brunch, but for a quiet relaxing stay I would go elsewhere. The beds were not very comfortable, no air conditioning in the rooms so ti was pretty hot during the day and while it was cool at night we couldn't close the windows because the room would heat up so we had to listen to some crazy bird noises all night and we couldn't close the blackout curtains as they were almost plastic so would block all the air so it was quite bright in the mornings. Bathroom was fine but toiletries were terrible! The hotel was very nice. Room was clean and comfortable. The location was easy to find when we went to explore Antigua. The food was ok. Overall we had a good experience. I took my 14 year old son with me and he enjoyed our stay. I would stay there again I love the experience in the hotel, the only concern I have if the wifi connection it was really horrible, but everything else was perfect   Ricardo Grijalva We had a wonderful time I request my room t be closer to my granddaughter and the acomódate us very good When we arrived to the hotel the front desk did not request a card for deposit. As such when we had dinner we had to go back to the front desk to register a card. Hence lack of explanation. The hair dryer in the room was broken, so had to request for a change. Found a cockroach in the bathroom so lack of cleanliness was evident and the bathroom had a pungent smell. Overall not the greatest stay we have had at a hotel. Stayed with our two grown up children. Very well located near the central square. Had dinner here one night and the food was good. Really liked that the A La Carta tour agency was in the lobby. We arranged tours ahead of time. Vey convenient. There are multiple buildings and we were in a different building than our kids. Not a problem since they are grown but if you go with younger kids, check on this. Upscale property located near the central plaza. Clean comfortable and excellent staff. Looking forward to our next trip back This hotel is lovely. The grounds are gorgeous and our room, with a private balcony, was very nice. Food in the restaurant was delicious. We ate dinner one evening and breakfast on two occasions - all excellent. Would recommend highly. Only downside is that weddings on Saturday nights get a little noisy, but our room was quite soundproof, so once we closed balcony doors we were fine. Amazing place with great service and location. Highly recommended. Very good value Very comfortable and luxurious. Although I didn't got a complimentary bottle of wine they offer me via email prior to my stay. Great transportation service from parking lot to hotel, check in was very easy and fast. Staff always friendly. Good wifi. Delicious breakfast with local food. The hotel was beautiful. The rooms were very clean and spacious. Staff was incredibly helpful. The breakfast and lunch buffets had a variety of food items. Loved the pool area. Will definitely stay here again! The hotel is well located, near central square, restaurants, and other points of interest. Rooms are clean, staff is nice and always happy to assist you. However, the food’s quality can improve It was a great trip. This is an excellent hotel. Fantastic location, great food! Was great! Very convenient location. It was so nice! The experience was wonderful and the service, very nice and friendly. I hope to go back with my family next year. Fabulous hotel with old Spanish colonial charm and new world amenities. Couldn't have been nicer. Beautiful traditional hotel. Near the center of Antigua, good bar and restaurant, room with fireplace was lovely and grounds were wonderful (including two Macahs). I'd highly recommend it. Only bad thing was the expresso machine was broken during our stay. :( We enjoyed the rooms, the staff, the location and the whole atmosphere. The cobblestone roads, though quaint, could get a bit noisy, but things did settle down at night. The suggestions of where to go, what to see, etc., by everyone at the hotel was very helpful. We would definitely stay there again and recommend to friends! We were pleasantly surprised by the gardens and wood beams throughout. Omg! The flower centrepieces were breathtaking, so were views of mountains/volcanoes from rooftop patios. Cockatoos would perch in gardens. Room/washroom was always immaculate, 6 pillows + 2 decorative,down comforter and blankets provided. The bed was extremely comfortable. Our room was 418 ( quiet, uninterrupted sleep). Staff were hardworking,very friendly and willing to help. We loved it and will most likely visit Porta again. one of the ladies at the front desk, probably the lady in charge (Carolina if I am correct) lied to me and my family about availability of rooms at the hotel. I found about later when I created a second reservation. we were given a room at the far end of the hotel were no guest were even though we were told the hotel was fully occupied. the next day staff was helpful and accommodate us in a new room, much nicer one. we were told breakfast was going to be included with the room but we ended up being charged for it very disappointing as I am from guatemala, do not go back to my country a lot, I spent only 2 nights in antigua and i have chosen this hotel in the past when I visit. next time will have to look into a different hotel Personal amazing, ready to help you with everything, safe and the best rate to change dollar store We had a great experience at Porta Hotel Antigua. The location is just enough off the beaten path that you don't get disturbed by tourists. The pool had a nice community feel. The staff was incredibly accommodating, from dialing international numbers for us to making fires in our fireplace each night. I would definitely stay here if we go back to Antigua! I love it and definitely recommend to friend. Thank you for the excellent job. ♥️ This is a very good hotel for the area but certainly not a 5 star hotel. We were placed in a room in a building across from the actual hotel and our room was so noisy from street traffic that I didn't sleep. We checked out the next morning  even though we were scheduled to stay 2 nights. They made us pay anyway. We were very disappointed and wouldn't stay here again.
We wanted a short break in the sun with no kids running around screaming and this hotel looked perfect. We arrived late and the greeting was lovely. Overall the staff were extremely helpful and polite throughout. We booked a standard room which had a car park facing view but it was fine and still had an open view from the large balcony. Breakfast is very good with a good selection of hot and cold buffet and an fresh orange juice squeezer. In high season they have a violinist playing at breakfast and live music at dinner. We opted for half board and were not disappointed, soup, salad buffet, meat, fish, or vegetarian choices for main, and lots of dessert choice. The hotel is 10 minutes drive from Albufeira, so a rental car is useful or it is 5 Euro by taxi. There is a supermarket with coffee shop within 5 minutes drive on the road to Armacao de pera. you cannot walk to anything from the hotel so bear this in mind. San Rafael beach is a 15-20 minute walk and there is a smaller one about 10 minutes away. Loads of other beaches within a short drive. Finally the pools are quite small but there is sufficient beds and shade and it is DEAD quiet. There are showers and toilets by the pool for those with later flights after check-out time. In my view, this hotel did not warrant a 4 star rating. It was very dated and rooms and pool/dining areas needed a complete updating and refurbishing. Rooms were very basis, although very clean. The pool area sunbeds and parasols were very worn and drab and the parasols in the outdoor dining area were torn and tatty - there was no ambiance to the area for eating out. The breakfast provided was a good selection but was disappointed with the evening meals - not well presented and certainly not 4 star rating. On a plus point, the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the Manager and Reception Staff. The hotel is in an excellent position and had lovely views of the sea from the balcony - with some investment into its upkeep, this would be a lovely hotel which has the beautiful beaches of Arrifes Beach and Sao Raphael Beach only a few minutes walk away with their own excellent beach restaurants - their fish dishes were delicious and very well presented. We have stayed in the Sao Rafael area many times but never at this hotel. We were pleasantly surprised and have had a very enjoyable stay here. The hotel is very clean and modern with friendly and helpful staff. The room was a good size with good quality fittings, TV and tea making facilities. There was a welcome bottle of water, tea bags, coffee and some milk. The bathroom was also a generous size with a bath, shower, bidet and toilet. There was a plentiful supply of shower gel and shampoo, toilet rolls and tissues. The balcony was large with a carpark/village view which is what we expected. The only thing I could say is that the matress protectors (I know they are necessary), were plastic backed which is the reason I gave an OK review for the room. I found them uncomfortable especially after a very hot day. The bed and pillows were, however, very comfortable. The air con is extremely efficient. There are 2 outdoor pools and an indoor pool, all maintained well. Shower/toilet facilities round the pools excellent. Had a B&B stay. Breakfasts good with lots of choice and even had live violin music on 2 occasions, very civilised. We only ate in the hotel one night and unfortunately I think they were a member of staff down and we had to wait for food as the visitors on full board were being served first. Service was, as a result slightly disjointed. Food was ok. Fairly close to beach, about 10 minute walk and 20 minute walk to Marina and 45 min walk to Old Town. I visited the hotel for 4 nights as part of a business trip. It has a good central location in the resort (which is mainly hotel and residential). There are a few restaurants and a shop nearby. The hotel has its own breakfast restaurant which served a good buffet, and a separate pizzeria that I didn't visit. The beach is just over a 5 minute walk away. The pool area is good and the indoor pool is a nice touch. The gym is okay. My room was very comfortable and a good size, especially the bathroom, which was huge. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Hotel is close to two nice beaches in a very quiet location. Other than that you need a car if you want to move around and explore. Not sure I would call it a 4 stars hotel but it's fair to say that rooms are spacious and breakfast offers plenty of choice. The only down side I feel like mentioning is the staff not very welcoming and friendly. It's nice to be welcomed by someone smiling. It did not seem to be the case. Overall anyway for the price we paid it was more than worthy. And I would recommend it. Had a real relaxing week with loads of variety at the breakfast buffet. The staff were helpful and friendly. Restaurants and the minimarket were in walking distance. The beach was close and the marine was within a 20minute walk. first class hotel  stayed twice  once in july and also in october  only one little downside cleaners do not  do rooms until late  afternoon... Pleasantly surprised on arrival - no waiting for room to be made ready ! Check in was quick and very efficient..There were no surprises as hotel was described on the website. We got the quiet, peaceful holiday we hoped for. Very close to the beach,not long walk to marina and beautiful views around. We have it room facing the ocean. We enjoyed mornings and evenings in a balcony just watching to the ocean. Swimming pools are nice too,but most we spend on a beach. We found one  restaurant, not far after the local shop,food there is very good and people are very friendly.Shame I don't remember the name. the staff were really helpful and very pleasant nothing was to much for them. room was lovely and clean and cleaned daily, great choice for breakfast and got a good deal when upgraded to half board. Possibly a high  3 star but not a 4.Staff are super helpful and will go out of their way to help.Breakfast could be improved by better quality produce..cheap bacon, sausage and beans..looked and tasted the part.Good selection of fruits and mediocre pastries. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner but again very basic dishes..better off going to the marina and old town for more choices. Lovely hotel a bit far out but we didn't mind the walk to the old town Had a great experience staying at this hotel! Most amazing was the staff: pleasant, accommodating, highly professional and always ready to assist and/or give honest advice on local attractions, food, transportation or whatever else you might need assistance with. The owner of the hotel was frequently seen on site, also greeting his customers and making sure that we are safe and happy with our stay. Comfortable, clean rooms with a beautiful view on ocean or on hills (depending on the side of the building), delicious breakfasts for various tastes included (and lunches and suppers are also available on site for additional cost), conveniently located close to the ocean and not too far from the Old town and shopping malls (we walked by foot, but taxi is only 6 euros). Found this to be a lovely hotel. We stayed from 17th-24th July. Lovely friendly staff, especially Paulo in the restaurant, very friendly, helpful & professional. We never ate dinner here but had lunch everyday & food was always lovely & a good bar selection too all with reasonable prices. The rooms were pretty nice & we had a lovely sea view. There is some building work going on beside the hotel but i must say it caused us very little disruption as the doors seemed to keep out all noise when closed. It was such a luxury to have proper descent airconditioning & a few english channels on the tv aswell as wifi. The rooms were always well cleaned everyday if you wanted. Theres 2 pools with a gud few loungers & direct access to the bar/restaurant. This hotel seems ideal for couples especially as there was little or no kids there for the week.You can walk to the marina in about 10 minutes. Here there is several bars & restaurants. A taxi to the old town is no more than e7 or the new town bout e8/9. My only issue is trying to get a taxi out of the oldtown at night is a nightmare!!! The queues are crazy long & one night we even walked a good bit of the way to the hotel & arrived at a dual carraigeway with no footpath so had to go back. Also its very rare that a taxi will stop at the side of the road for you.Also if you come out of the back of the hotel a little walk down the hill there's a little fisherman's beach, its a real hidden gem with a little a little bar/restaurant.
Hotel was in a good location, the decor was a bit tired in the room but it was clean. Mini bar prices were inflated 3.90 euros for a tiny bottle of water was very over priced. We had a lovely weekend and were extremely happy with the hotel. Booked a room, but got sent over the road for an 'upgrade' to an apartment (noisy old empty flat)...terrible nights sleep. If I'd have wanted an empty flat I'd have AirBNB! The room I stay the air con is spoiled. When I requested to change room. I was told no room is available. I told them if I won't get a room by end of days, I will move to other hotel. Later in the evening, I was given a new room. So overall I am satisfied with the hotel. Breakfast everyday the same. No new items. Is ok for me but it will be nice if they can change the menu for 1 or 2 items. Breakfast variety is acceptable except they is no vegetables. Will be nice if salad is provided during breakfast. The hotel's appearance is great, but there is a lot of maintenance issues; switches that don't work, broken door handles, etc. Signage was limited too making direction difficult. The staff were nice but unable to organise the breakfast. We stayed in the annexe across the road which a newish build. Clean and comfortable. Nice place but needs work. Food, breafast and coffee in the room really expensive so best to buy these items outside. Cannot fault this hotel at all, clean rooms, Comfortable beds, hot showers...Staff all very friendly and helpful., Lovely breakfast every morning, with plenty of food choice...Nice central location.. Room 621..its on the opposite side of the front desk across the street. The moment you enter there is a foul smell in the room. Almost like you are standing by a toilet that hadnt been flushed from the big job. Housekeeping acknowledged the smell and left an odor machine which didnt help essentially i had check out at 8am and now sitting in thr coffee shop with luggage. They didnt give me another room... Ghent is a beautiful place... Id go again in a heartbeat but will never stay here. Not sure if its a health hazard,  woukd recommend to shut down that room and get it thoroughly checked. While i find some place to sleep recovering from a sleepless,  foul smell night. Nice but overpriced. Attic room was to warm to sleep comfortably, even late fall. Airco did not work, only heater. Windows too small to  let fresh air in.
The hotel based in a huge complex alongside cinema, shoppingmall, Eatly venue. The hotel is very modern, clean and comfort. Very recommended. A little far from the city center, but easy to reach and is located next to market, mall... quiet zone We really enjoyed our stay. The underground was quite near so it is quite easy to get into Turin. The hotel has an excellent breakfast. Service was impeccable and all staff were quite gracious. Our room was excellent; we particularly liked the shower and the view. We walked to the automobile museum, which we recommend. Very nice hotel, ideal for the concert i was going to. Even had a race track on the roof! !
Lovely accommodating staff that were always friendly and willing to help. Clean room, restaurant, pool area etc. Good variety of food, wasn't a single meal where either of us went hungry, and with the great snack bar aswell we were very happy. Will definitely  be using  Azuline hotels in the future! Stay was fantastic. Hotel let me down by ignoring my email and request to be situated in Amantis 1. Especially as I was a returning guest yet again. When I asked at the check in desk I was bluntly told that the block was fully booked and that I was to stay over the road where all the club 18-30's stay. The young guests either side of me were very load all NIGHT. Even when I informed them I had booked the room months ago and even emailed them my request. The tv was tiny. The view was straight over the noisy entertainment stage. The beds were tiny. The pillow was small and no extra pillows in the room. However this did not spoil my great holiday there. Stayed for the weekend for my birthday , had a great stay . Lovely sea view room The food was good, plenty of choice in the restaurant,and also the snack bar.We went all inclusive good choice of drinks too. Staff nice.Location great lovely scenery/ Amazing stay.. had no problems what-so ever. My 5 year old totally loved it. It would have been nicer to have tea coffee facility in my room.
When we pulled up we thought the hotel was in an amazing location. Sea views were awesome! Check in was very quickly done. The room we should have stayed in was suitable for us. It was better suited to a family as straight outside level with the big window was a smaller pool suitable for children and a play area right by the door. As a middle aged couple we wanted somewhere a bit quieter. Haven't never been in a situation to say anything I was pleasantly surprised hoe accompanying the hotel was. Yes we had to pay a supplement for the room as it was right close to the sea but worth every penny. We got a bottle of bubbly as an apology! The room was a really good size and the shower was excellent loads of hot water no matter time of day. The rooms were kept to a reasonable standard of cleaning although we had ants which was reported and delt with straight away. The restaurant was massive and there was a few dishes to chose from. What I liked that there was loads of different varieties of bread and rolls to choose from. There must have been 12! The times to eat are good too. Breakfast from 7-30am-10.30am Lunch 1-3.30 and dinner 7.30pm-10.30pm. We were only half board but we could either have lunch or dinner which is good if you want to go somewhere but not miss out on any meals. The location is fabulous if you just want to chill out and not do a lot. Magaluf and Palmanova are a 10 min bus ride away and Palma a hour. The hotel has good rooms, better pools, superb personal an food, with an almost private beach There are kitchenettes in the rooms, but we did not use it because the food at the restaurant was unbelievable. Breakfast  with at least 5 kinds of cheese, no less than 5 different cold cuts. Ten different pastries, salads, different type of eggs, hot food, yogurt, ice cream, etc, etc. Ah, even Cava !!! (Spanish champagne) I am not going to describe lunch and dinners, but we could not even tried one forth of the dishes and deserts in every dinner. The hotel was built surrounded by the cala. Street level is 5 floors above the sea (and beach) level, and the open corridors to the rooms are balconies in front of the natural stone. After staying at other Barcelo hotels we were extremely disappointed in this one and moved after one night . Having booked a superior plus room it was basically a room with a bed in . Hotel has lifts but still lots of stairs everywhere you are going  Lots of the sun beds do not get the sun  All inclusive was certainly not like standards of other hotels and there is very little in the area as an alternative  Management staff were helpful when we requested to move hotels Mostly suitable for families and children. Would benefit from dance area/disco after 10pm. Entertainment very good. Great experience! friendly staff. Went to Majorca as part of our honeymoon Lovely spot. Nice small clean beach and crystal clear water. Sun on the pool all day. Food is typical buffet, ok but not amazing, should be something for everyone however. Great for a short break away and possibly longer if your willing to go to the local attractions. Not what u expect from a 4 star hotel .rooms are dark ,and food was bad . No water in the room even if u want to pay for it . There is no way to call the front desk Generally a good experience. The hotel had double booked us on the first night however they found a nearby suitable hotel for the first evening, upgraded us from half board to all inclusive and gave us a beach facing view and complimentary bottle of champagne. The 2 pools were of an average size however you do have direct access to the beach which worked really well. Was ok, food simple and very similar mostly fish dishes only. Brilliant if you speak Spanish, you get served first at dinner seated first and get cutterly first as well as offered drinks first ow and you get que jump at the bar as well as other privalages such as not paying for drinks which are not included on the all inclusive deal. But hey such is life I guess. But I must say: Gabriel, the H and Paulina - I think that's spelt right (the entertainers) are absolutely fantastic, they made the not so pleasant weather and not so pleasant service from other hotel staff so much more bearable. These 3 need a pay rise for what they do it really would be a loss to the hotel if even one of these got taken by someone else. Brilliant group of people such a laugh. Thanks to these 3 for making my stay feel 5* when I would only rate the hotel a generous 2* We enjoyed our 4 night stay  Private beech pool area and cleanliness and entertainment is admirable  They make sure you don't get bored atall every nite they had variety of shows and during day time it was all about several activities  It's best holiday with children  Magaluf and palmanova beaches are very pretty and close by Aswell  The only issue I had was that 90% good container pork so me being strictly no pork eater was left with few choices but they always has fresh fruit to offer so I literally ate vege pizza and fruit through out our stay sometimes fish Aswell  There is no way you can't fell in love with staff Fantastic friendly useful staff. Excellent strong wifi. Lovely food. Didn't get bored at all. Gorgeous beach. Great spa. Couldn't ask for more. Cannot praise this hotel enough!! The staff cannot do enough for you!! Thank you for our lovely stay!
Nice hotel Big rooms Great breakfast  The overall experience was great. I will book this hotel again when I am in Viareggio We stayed in a very nice deluxe room with a big balcony giving side views to the sea and also over the pinewoods and mountains. No real gripes although the water was rather Lukewarm. Staff very friendly and helpful , breakfast pretty good too, All in all a really nice stay, We were scheduled to stay in a two bedroomed apartment close by and were let down the day before arrival. We were fortunate to secure a room at the Astor and even better, after our first night we moved to a Suite. It was superb! Breakfast was exceptional and like the classic hotel it is, the service was top quality. The fitness room could be slightly better equipped; Barbells and Kettlebells maybe. There were also children using these facilities on one day which, was a disappointment however, this should not distract from the tremendous time we had at the hotel and the great staff who make it special. A poor example of this type of hotel. Stained carpets,stained toilet in bedroom, in need of complete refurbishment. How it has its star rating is unclear. It was the perfect location in Viareggio Beautiful hotel on the sea. Room was great. Beach across the street. Wonderful spa.
Close to the centre about 5 mins walk from the metro station and 10 mins from the mall. Hotel is within a cluster of 3 star/4 star hotels. Friendly staff who are eager to help. The hotel has a nightclub so it can be noisy in the late night. Comfortable rooms with the usual amenities. Free water on arrival and there's a fridge/minibar. One advice: the Deira area is now notorious with ladies offering massages/other activites (you know what I mean!) and some just follow you into the hotel so you have to be careful. Staff are attentive and will chuck these ladies out and there are security staff about but (as I experienced), you get stopped and asked if you're trying to take the ladies to your room...can be embarassing trying to plead innocence!! You get used to it and it was a comfortable stay overall. Hotel has a very good location at Al Rigga station which is just 4 stops from airport. Take a North exit at the stn. and walk ahead toward Al Bassan shoppingCentre -turn on the right walk a little and you'll see the hotel. There is nothing I can complain. Only small thing : I have sent email that I dont need a mini bar and fridge can be empty coz I dont use mini bar. They didnt empty. Supermarket opposite the hotel open 24hrs. I only thought pool area is bigger which I saw in the pictures but I think due to bar built now is smaller. I recommend this hotel . My colleague and I booked rooms here because we had a early morning meeting nearby (during the work week). The rooms were clean and the staff are pleasant. Unfortunately, we barely slept due to the noise from the street outside (windows are terrible quality) and the constant movement of prostitution activity in the hotel. We were awoken many times during the night by ladies loudly moving between rooms. Also, the shisha bar on the rooftop was loud with activity all night. Do not stay here if you need a good night of sleep and must work in the morning. Good Location. Close to Riqqa street. Some what noisy room. Room clean though. Good size room, clean and comfortable beds, nice staff, fast internet, close to market and shopping and metro. Furniture is bit old. Room was fine but hotel staff needs to be courteas Slow checking in & out. Be ready to pay AED 200 as a deposit! Gym hours were terrible. There're some times for men and times for women. Are you kidding me? Had to wait at the reception when someone go up and check my room and the mini bar. Waste of time..   Good luck! Amazing hotel for a business trip, I don't recommend it for families with kids. Hotel location is very nice, facilities are good, The price is very very good and the staff and room service personnel are very friendly and their response is usually very quick, but the main issue with this hotel is room cleanliness,,, the room is very dirty, the sheets and towels are very dirty and they smell very bad as well We have been there for 5 nights . Service was excellent . Hotel clean and good location specifically being close to the metro al Riga  station Had a good stay. Very responsive for room service. Staff were excellent I'd like to thank Mr. Abongni who is in the resumption. Hi's very kind. I have lived here 15 days and i have enjoyed this stay. Their staff is very good specially rajKumaar he is a good worker . They put me in a huge suite at no additional charge. Result :-) The hotel was overall a good stay for me. The staff are helpful. There is room for improvement in Breakfast buffet. It is always overcrowded and breakfast items runs out too quickly , and does not refill promptly. People warking inside are so good specially raj Kumar anb has 2 Adar Guess for Nice in good This is the fifth time I stay in Avari dubai hotel thtough 2 years. Good welcoming, smiling, welcome juice sometimes, easy check in. During stay, it is a nice and comfortable. Daily cleaning and changing the bed. Supply all you need in room: complimentary daily water, tea, coffee, Dental kit, shaving kit, etc. Check out so easy, just asking you if you taje anything from mini bar. I'm planning to stay again in this hotel during next visit to dubai in nov. 2017 And Jan 2018. Enjoyed stay, no problems and rooms nice and staff nice and very helpful. Arrived early as  have young family the hotel let us check in early which was really appreciated, and we also paid to extend room in eve has had late flight. breakfast had plenty of choices and small pool on roof of hotel which our son loved. about 5-10 mins walk to metro (though taxi not that expensive), hotel nearer airport than sites but fine for us. overall great hotel and happy experience, thank you. Not a pleasant experience at all. We stayed at two more hotels during this trip but this by far the worst stay we had. I can say staff is friendly and accommodating specially Mr. ASHRAF who went above and beyond but hotel is really out dated, filthy and not kids friendly at all,this is definitely not a family hotel. They have a bar and a club on a ground floor and stays open throughout the night. Security guards and bouncer are in position in case situation arises which I have experienced it my self while fight broke outta the bar. Vulgar language, inappropriate dressed females walking in and out of the club and bar, bar fights ,seen it all. I’ll never stay here nor that I’ll recommend this hotel to anyone. I had great experience with 2 more hotels I booked through hotels.com and Honestly they should bit more research on properties like Avari Dubai because it all about reputation. Hotels.com was recommended to me from a friend and I would like to do same to spread the word but this was money wasted. My ratings are below 1 star. Very good, I am very satisfied Stay was fair however the room I was assigned was of a lesser standard than the one I was previously given. It was fine to rest and recuperate after a long trip. It was amazing stay. All staff are friendly. They start talking to you by a Welcome drink. Special thanks to Mrs Aakansha (front desk manager), to Heba, to Shohak and to Ramesh. Was great! We even got a free upgrade!! Thank you for taking care of us Absolutely disgusting hotel and rooms. Cleanliness non existent and noisy. We had a very good time in Dubai and the hotel has been a good choice. The metro connection made it easy to reach everywhere, there are many restaurants in the area and the staf was very plesant and helpful. nice hold with good location and very good foods available, cleaning is very good room are good, staff was very cooperative and good. nice polite staff, decent sized room but bathroom was slightly outdated, decent location of hotel Wotif/hotel booked 3 person room instead of 4, even though the booking clearly stated 4 so had to haggle for upgrade. Beds like planks. Staff good and hotel ok.
The customer service at the hotel is fantastic, staff were happy to help with rearranging tours after some of mine were cancelled due to the weather. The room was very comfortable, had a safe built in, and a good supply of clean towels and bedding even to the point of extra pillows. The decor wasn't overly inspiring, but that's not a problem for me. View from the window quite good, as shown. What could have been improved was that the floor did need a bit of a vacuum cleaning! We had a long flight arriving early am @5am. Could have accommodated us by letting us go in earlier. We saw people on subsequent days w/ diff person in the front who let guest get in earlier! ! Enjoyed our stay there. The staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast was very good and Happy Hour every night was great. The only criticism I have is that the beds were too narrow. The hotel is located a couple of blocks from the Main Street and has easy access to central Reykjavik. I would return to this hotel. Clean and tidy. Great, helpful staff. Good location. Only (ridiculously small) critisism is that they used tiny plastic cups in the rooms for tea/coffee and there was no milk in rooms. Apart from that, great hotel - no frills - but perfect for a busy holiday. Would definitely use again. I requested a late check-in as I ended up arriving at the hotel around 2am in the morning. Reception staff was very friendly and welcoming. Hotel itself is clean and modern. There's a little balcony to the room. Conveniently located, probably about 15-20min walk from the Bus Terminal if you don't have much luggage. Approximately 5-10min walk to the main shopping street. Great base to explore the sights. Excellent breakfast. Good hotel with friendly & helpful staff. Happy hour in bar from 5 to 7 pm. Only 10 minute walk to main shopping area in Reykjavik. Decent and plentiful  breakfast. Does not serve lunch or dinner but there are many expensive restaurants nearby. Good size room, good breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff The whole room smelled like rotten eggs from the bathroom (sulfur in the water). Room key had to be placed in cardholder on wall to give power to the room. Every time we left and came back the clock would reset. Hotel room was renovated and nice looking. The breakfast buffet was very good. The whole downtown area seemed sketchy. The building directly across from the hotel had graffiti all over it. The hotel was lovely, rooms clean, staff helpful, breakfast plenty of. Well within walking distance of main shopping street and attractions. Clean and reasonably priced in a city with  high hotel rates. Close to shops, restaurants and major sights. The perks of having a hotel close to the station are that you could take the bus if planning to go further out the city beyond the center and if you are doing tours some of this will ask you to go to the nearest bus station. I like the location of the hotel and the room overall. It was spacious and clean. Good location. Free parking. Good size clean rooms. Breakfast included. Staff was very nice. Basic accommodations. Beds a little hard. Breakfast the same everyday. Overall the location & parking make this a good place to stay. Great hotel. Will definitely stay again. Would recommend. Comfortable and conveniently located in the CBD. The room was large and warm. Good location giving easy access to the centre of Reykjavik. Nice atmosphere with helpful staff and well stocked rooms, would have preferred a firmer mattress. Clean room,warm showers, comfortable bed, parking included a big plus, walking distance to downtown, only bummer was breakfast not included, but overall very happy with the accommodations and would return. The hotel is located in a great location to major routes and close to downtown. The room itself was OK..standard tub/shower, older mattress and covers. The room wasn't completely clean but I just ignored it. The bed had a wool blanket on it which we didn't use since it was dry clean only, and I highly doubt they cleaned it after each stay. The water pressure was great which was actually really nice (ladies will understand). The wifi was pretty awful and didn't allow you to download apps or use iMessages..basically had to be in the lobby area to browse the internet. The breakfast was decent, had some eggs and bacon each morning as well as an assortment of pastries and breads. Coffee and tea was always provided as well. Another pitfall was the parking. While I appreciate the free garage parking, you had to exit your vehicle, go into the lobby, and ask the attendant to open the garage for you...EVEN TO EXIT. Sometimes this took several minutes as you just sit and wait for someone to use the garage remote to let you in or out. Overall, it was OK, and I probably wouldn't stay here again, I'd try to find a slightly better hotel with better wifi and parking situation. We had to book this at the last minute due to a medical emergency. Got a tiny room. Very little space to put down anything in the shower-room. Booked a twin, but got a double (the bed was quite big, but not as large as two singles). Ran out of some of the breakfast foods about 15 minutes after breakfast started to be served. Very over-priced, especially as not very centrally located. Receptionist also told us that the hotel was over-booked and they wouldn't be able to fit in everyone! Most expensive and tiniest of rooms that I stayed in during my week in Iceland. The bed was hard, the pillow lumpy and the alarm went off in the night and was challenging to turn off. A great hotel in a brilliant location. The staff couldn’t do enough to help you and were very welcoming. Highly recommended. Booked a normal room but received a two floors one. The staff were wonderful and very helpful. Breakfast in the morning had a very nice selection of food and drinks. The bed was just ok, not the most comfortable. But overall, I had a great stay and definitely recommend Fosshotel Raudara. Receptionists’ quite nice and helpful. Nice reasonable hotel located near main walking area of town. Hotel was basic but clean, staff was friendly and they had a great breakfast and happy hour! The best breakfast ever Amazing. Daniel, the night-time concierge, became my friend and Reykjavik director of tourists operations. The entire visit to Iceland was only enhanced by the employees of the FossHotel Raudara. Instead of just the place I slept in between tours and sightseeing, it was its own wonderful encounter. Near to eating places. Room is clean and cozy. But wifi is slightly weak. Worse thing would have to be the twin beds stuck together to make a double. Other than that everything else was pretty good. Good breakfast variety. This hotel is in a good location as it is a couple of blocks from the main street with all the shops and restaurants but far enough away to avoid any noise from the late night bars. It is about a 10-15 minute walk right into the downtown. Since we came in on a very early flight and our room wasn't ready they stored our luggage and let us have breakfast as soon as we got there. There is a local bus stop right across the street. Most tour buses will come right to the hotel to pick you up  and drop you off. Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the interior courtyard/playground but it was quiet. We had a family room. We had a loft bedroom with a spiral staircase and a sleeper sofa. The sleeper sofa wasn't the most comfortable but tolerable. The room  and the bathroom was clean. The room was very warm and we could not find a thermostat so we ended up opening up the one tiny window that would open for some fresh air. The breakfast was good with a typical European fare: cold meats and cheeses, cereals, fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, pastries, hot sausages and scrambled eggs and more. My favorite was the fresh baked bread! I would cut a thick slice of the still warm bread and slather it with jam! The  staff was  friendly and helpful. One thing I was not happy about was there was no public computer to check in for the airline and print boarding passes. While I could check in on my phone I prefer to have hard copies of the boarding passes instead of using my phone. I really enjoyed my room, as I had a view of the church from it. (417). It was a single room with a twin bed and a small stand up shower. I know being 5’4” with a smaller built helped a lot in the shower and while using the toilet. If I were any bigger, it wouldn’t have worked for me. The breakfast was okay. Not a lot of choices. I stuck to kiwifruit, toast, and cereal. They also had a coffee machine which was nice too, and I was able to get a cafe latte. When I first arrived, I had been up for about a day, and the front desk lady was very rude to me. I tried to avoid asking her questions when she was working. However, there was a very nice, younger man there who worked a few days, and I really enjoyed him. He was able to give me his recommendations on food and places to go. Everything was nice, but I wasn’t looking for a resort. Just a place to sleep, whilst viewing the incredible scenery in Iceland. Rooms not very bad. Partial Mountain view in rear. Clean. Shower barely had any pressure. Quiet. The staff is wonderful, and the included breakfast is exceptional. The t.v. service was out for the entire hotel, and the light switch in each room controlled all electrical outlets and lights. I'd stay here again.
The hotel accommodation is very good and the staff are very friendly. Unfortunately our room on the third floor was adjacent to a building site where work commenced at 7am every morning, was overlooked by the multi story car park on the other side and very close to the main strip which was exceptionally noisy. The double glazing did little to deaden the noise which was particularly difficult when trying to get to sleep at night. The local people seem to use the beach road as a race track for their high octane vehicles which are very noisy. Our review may have been very different if we had been situated elsewhere in the hotel, nearer the beachfront or on a higher floor level. Check in was very long, never had to sign a bunch of papers at a hotel before. Went to my room and as soon as I stepped off the elevator onto my floor there was a very strong fish smell. It was nauseating. There was no beach access, it was taped off.something that should have been mentioned on the phone to me since that's the main reason you stay at a beachfront hotel. The staff was nice but you felt like you were being watched. It was a very weird experience. It was me and two other couples that stayed in the hotel. We met in one room to play some cards, after we were done I headed back to my room and there was security standing outside the door saying there was a complaint of loud noise coming from this floor. They never knocked but seemed to just be standing there listening. We were not being loud. The rooms had a very musty smell to it. Overall it was dissapointing stay and alittle unnerving. The couch was the most uncomfortable couch I have ever encountered in a hotel, it sloped downward from backrest to front causing back pain after sitting for a while for both me and my wife. The stove in my 1 bedroom was not in good repair, and the living room patio door as well as the balcony door in the bedroom both had poor weather stripping so you could hear and feel the wind blowing outside. Our room was near the elevator shaft, so it kept us awake half of the night until guests stopped returning from their night out. There is also a big hotel/resort construction project next door, so we were woken up by the noise daily between 5:10 am and 7:00 am, which we were never notified of when we booked our 9 day stay 4 months prior to our vacation. Even though there were many vacant rooms available according to Diamond members staying there, we were never offered a room change to get us away from the noise. The pool area and beach access were nice, but I would not stay at this place again Very clean, room stayed in efficiently room. Nice, not real big but was okay with us, bathroom was roomy. Small kitchenette stoked with what you would need to cook. Coffee maker with  a couple packets of coffee. No keurig. We were on the north side, had a view of beach and street. Tiki bar was great by the pool with small water slide, but you have to keep going out the pool unlock the gate each time you want to use the slide. I didn’t care for this if someone had kids. Nice grills to cook out on by the pool. Could go out the gate and right down to the beach. Hotel supplies nice beach towels. Lots of lounge chairs. Only one ice machine and it’s by the pool area. There aren’t any on any floors. I would stay here again. I would stay here again My eight year old son loved the slide into the pool. The pool area was clean and the water was warm. The hotel itself is okay. Nothing to write home about, but not bad either. I'd stay again (mainly for my son and the slide.) Chose this at the last minute driving through. Very pleasantly surprised! Would not hesitate to come back Was in the middle of 50 + mph winds and hotel staff did not mention underground parking until after unpacking bags. Facilities constructed in mid 70s and maintained with marginal discipline. Trying for a premium stay look elsewhere nothing magical here. Great modern clean room and great grounds. The only thing that I was disappointed in is that the room didn't have a balcony. We unaware that they only clean the room ever 4 days, until it happen. We had to call to get beach towels the 2nd morning because of this. They brought us enough for time we were there. Also their  presentation conditions etc. were clear. No desk, just a small chair in a corner. Overall room is very tiny for what appears on the online photos. View from the room was a construction worksite. Not pleasant. Staff were very friendly and hotel and pool were nice but we were charged 54 dollars resort fee we were there for 4 nights and had no maid service and had to take your own rubbish. Would not go back, Tiki bar was run of the mill waitress was lovely but drinks were poor quality. We stay in Diamond resorts in Tenerife which beat this in to fits. Fun check-in was told that we could not have a late check-out time. Was not happy with that. However front desk clerk went out of her way to check with her manager I was able to get us a late check-out time. The staff was very accommodating with our needs. Excellent place to stay. Have stayed here once before Lovely room and facilities the room was enormous had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay Check in dismal,  parking difficult at times didn't enforce bikers parking in designated spaces. My stay at the Daytona Regency was very nice, the location is great. The staff were exceptional in every way, going out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The beach access was not functional so getting on the beach was awkward. Underground parking was a nice feature. Room layout and size perfect for the number of people we had on and out throughout the week. I showed up to check in I was given a room where the keys didn’t work I went back forth down from the 9th floor to the 1st all for them to find out someone was staying there. Then I was given a second room where the keys didn’t work so I went down to the lobby told them I will be back after I pick my wife up and they need to fix this the hotel is nice but it took me two hour to get my room The check out hours definitely need to be extended to 11am. Please keep me on the special pricing list Booked for Daytona Bike Week. Nowhere on hotels.com did it say the hotel did not allow parking for bike trailers, and there was nothing flagged on the hotel website either. The hotel called us 3 days prior to arrival to say there was a new hotel being built next door and there would be noise as they would be pouring concrete, but did not say anything about no trailer parking even though they knew we were coming for bike week. When we arrived (after driving 16 hours from NJ) we were told about the parking, which left us in a bind. The hotel gave us the names of 2 places offering trailer parking, but both were already sold out. We offered to pay for an additional parking space but were told ABSOLUTELY NO by the manager! BTW, our trailer is a 6x10 open, flat trailer, not a big enclosed unit. The manager did offered to cancel our reservation and refund our money, but that would have also left us in a bind. We ended up driving around Daytona for an hour and a half, totally stressed out, until we found a hotel lot that let us park our trailer for $25./day, which added another $100. to our vacation. And then, when parking in the hotel's underground parking lot (which was never full the entire time we were there), we saw 2 small bike trailers that were parked there all week. The hotel itself was nice. Just didn't need the stress and aggravation regarding the trailer issue. great place, however our room was city view. there was a card in the room offering ear plugs since there is construction next door, and, yes they worked from sunset to sundown. I used the ear plugs, but not for that....all the motorcycles and hot rods lighting it up on the main drag! had room 301 which is a suite 550sq ft.  living room with pull out bed, dining room, full kitchen with everything, big bedroom, one big bathroom. pool, hot tub, parking tiki bar with food. if you could get a pool view room...... We were blown away by how nice our room was. The only request is to have various thickness of pillows for the bed, not just big thick ones. Great stay and look forward to coming back. No cable very loud horrible view Had a water leak in the room and was told they could not change my room and we had to deal with the fans running to dry the floor. Person at the desk was very rude when asked about another room. extra fees when you arrive, not all the rooms have the balcony, the tub shower doesn't hold the water. the rooms are too small. We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a very convenient area. Easy to walk to great restaurants, Local shopping and the best of all...the beach. Great location for Daytona bike week and a breach trip. Just was noisy with bike week motorcycles all night and 35 cushion withers and a crane next door that started every day at 7am. We were told about the construction prior to staying,  but it was not a restful trip. The room was very large and comfortable bed. Excellent property to stay at! Customer service was excellent, Hotel is was very nice, location was excellent, I would call the hotel for pricing. I would stay there again Great trip, service was excellent, the room was great. Would love to come back! Only thing wrong lousy internet Nice clean place. Very comfortable and convenient. Only downside was we had a room with a view of the dumpsters in the adjacent hotel. Got to the hotel and the room was not with two beds as expected. There is no way two adults would have been able to stay in that small room. Clerk downstairs was very helpful in finding us a room at another facility. Getting credit for our cancellation may be a problem. Will be calling today. Look out for hidden fees- they call them activity fees. Hotel is ok, but I will not go back to Daytona Beach. Homeless people laying on the beach, active baggers and drug heads. Police within sight, but never saw them address the problem-it must just be acceptable. They were having a jacked-up truck rally the weekend we were there. Drag racing at 1:00AM in front of the hotel. Instead of relaxing, I felt like I had been at work for three(3) days. The hotel was ready when we arrived. They said welcome home three times, So that obviously means it's important. Staff seemed more interested in trying to get you to go to a timeshare seminar than providing good service.... Room was recently renovated ,BUT there was mold all over the bathroom ceiling where it had been painted over and is now starting to grow back thru the paint. Had to stand at the front desk for a long time trying to get a towel for the pool, but no one seemed to be working. I walked around the lobby area with another guest who was apparently looking for some towels to for his kids when finally a maintenance/security (?) guy said he would get some towels for us. The pool area was well maintained and clean,  and the location to beach and the boardwalk is great. BUT, with the mold problem and poor service I'm not sure how they're planning on selling any timeshares. Daytona Beach Regency is amazing. My wife and I travel extensively. We were very impressed with the friendliness of the staff,the amenities,and our suite was spotless. The Regency is a really nice hotel in the perfect location, you can park your car and walk to several places for food and entertainment! Oceanwalk is very close by (5 minute walk) Sliding door chain was half pulled off the wall. Shower curtain wasn't attached to the wall and fell down. Tub backed up with water during a shower. Construction next door at 5 am on a SUNDAY was no bargain either. I expected more from a high end time share motel. Overall staf, location and Condition of the hotel was great Right on the beach, nice pool, nice Tiki bar, lots of activities for kids and adults at the resort. Hotel was nice,location was great, but construction next door not so good,
Good location in centre of old town. Walking distance to beach, cathedral, shops and bus/train stations. Room smelled musty - some evidence of flood damage on ceiling. Small window - no view and very little light into the room. We had no wifi in our room and could only access wifi in reception. There was daily housekeeping but we would have preferred to have had stronger wifi signal than clean towels every day! Place was cleaned and room spacious. Bed was comfortable. Good WiFi. The only negative is that the elevator is extremely slow.

We stayed at great REGENCY Madurai its the best hotel to stay at Madurai. The hotel is very well located and it takes only 10 minutes to reach The Meenakshi Temple. The best way to reach temple is to hire an auto, it will be arranged by the hotel reception itself. The REGENCY great Madurai offers good facilities like swimming pool, good car parking and Wi-Fi. The restaurant is mind blowing and its superb for its variety of cuisines. The food served was very excellent, nice, warm and fresh. The hotel provides a complimentary buffet breakfast. To be frank it was sooo delicious, we actually enjoyed a lot. The REGENCY staff were very keen and helpful. They explained the various places of interest in Madurai to us. The hotel itself has a souvenir shop with a good collection of Madurai handicrafts. Especially Madurai is famous for its Silk and off course Food. We also bought Madurai Silk from a Tamilnadu State Government owned shop near Temple. I strongly recommend my fellow travelers that great REGENCY Madurai is the apt place to stay at Madurai, no doubt at all. Location of the hotel was good and it was easily to locate the hotel.

I had stayed in this inn with my family when we are on outing for experience reason. The stay was decent and I delighted in a considerable measure with my gang. The hotel was decent. Stayed at GRT during an emergency trip to Madurai. Very nice hotel, good hospitality and good staff, restaurant staff was very pleasant and well trained, good food, location is also good, we had one day stay, could not enjoy more facilities as we rushed for work. Have stayed here few times. The rooms are spacious. They have recently renovated all the rooms. Prefer the rooms on 1st Floor. Have been staying at GRT hotels all over Tamilnadu, GRT Madurai is one of my favourite. It has a swimming pool although small. The food is excellent. The Lobby is very impressive. I would definitely recommend this property. It's value for money as compared to other hotels I have stayed in Madurai. One of the premier hotels to stay, GRT Regency is a good choice for a short stay of about 2-3 days while you are in Madurai City. Located to all prominent modes of transport it offers, the best staying option. Rooms are good and luxurious. Food is great. Service is good. Best time to visit is during the Winter season as it's really hot during summer. This hotel is located in a very congested area - Palanganatham main Road. The newly constructed flyover has only made things worse for the traffic outside the hotel. But, the hotel is a good one - spacious rooms and very clean. Added advantage is the complementary breakfast - very tasty but can have even more variety like the buffet dinner (which though comes at extra cost). The hotel was conveniently located and was easy to travel. The staff at the hotel were well mannered and good in services. The room allotted to me was good with all the basic amenities were in proper working condition. There was no delay during check in and check out process and it was done smoothly. The hotel was worth and it was reasonable. The best part of the hotel was breakfast. The hotel location was good. I had visited with my family. Complimentary breakfast was provided by the hotel.

The overall experience of the hotel was good. There was no activity arranged by the hotel.
Good but very lively hotel, very clean, good facilities especially land train around resort. Worth trying all 3 sites owned by company, as some quiet, some livelier. St Louis imed at twenty something's in entertainment and non stop music. Buffet very busy, could do with two sittings. Great value for money, especially a young family. Rooms and pool areas sparkling clean. Great reception staff, good star to Lorenzo ! Excellent hotel run by lovely people. Food was varied every night and always hot. Service staff were attentive throughout. Rooms were kept clean as were all the hotel grounds. Entertainment staff were entertaining. S'algar itself is quiet resort however the hotel offers free transfers to Mahon, Punta Prima and any of the other 3 hotels in resort so enough to keep you busy. Lovely food, lovely staff, great for a relaxing break. Would definitely stay again. Only minor complaint was the smell of cigarette smoke in our room from other guests smoking nearby. A very quiet resort but good for visiting Mahon and a sea view room is a must. We spent our days by the sea and didn't go all inclusive. The local supermarket was cheap and a couple of different bars. 3 nights was enough to feel relaxed during our travels around menorca.
The location of the hotel was very convenient. Close to transport to/from the airport, close to the metro and close to stores and restaurants. The room was quite comfortable, though I visited Madrid in the winter and the cleaner would leave my window open and the room would be freezing by the time i got back to the hotel. The walls were also quite thin in the hotel so if late at night or early in the morning a guest or cleaner was rummaging around you’d likely be woken by it. For the price the location is fantastic. Very basic hotel just off la rambla. Clean and tidy and we had a room with a balcony which was nice. Beds weren't very comfy and pillows extremely hard! Also the patio doors didn't block out any noise and with roads being cleaned at 2am made for a very unsettled night!! Shower facilities were great and maid was fab even cleaning the room after 11am. Staff were friendly and helpful but the fact we couldn't sleep well let the hotel down. Stayed one night here and the hotel was ideal for us. The price was reasonable, the room was clean and modern and it is almost right on La Rambla and very near a metro station. The staff speak good English. The bed was horrible and gave me a bad ache. The blanket was a bed sheet and did keep you cozy at night. The air in the room was bad abd that could be a cause of me getting sick. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Great location! Right off of Las Ramblas No  ice machine ! How can I drink my gin and tonic's  without ice . Located right in the middle of La Rambla surrounded with eateries and shops, we found ourselves in a tourist hotspot once we stepped outside. The check-in was quick and easy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. As with any hotel surrounded with restaurants and bars, it might be a little bit noisy at night. However, it was not an issue as we were returning to our room after midnight everyday. Small room but good location in the Gothic Quarter. Very noisy at night with people partying, garbage trucks and street cleaners. Basic budget hotel, clean room, comfortable bed, just off Las Rambla and 500 metres from Placa Catalunya. Only stayed one night after a cruise. The location is perfect and price is also reasonable. However, the attitudes of staffs are really poor and they are so nasty. It made me irritated. So I will never use this hotel. The hotel is very central to sights, shops, transport etc. Easy to get taxis outside, and plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes nearby. Fairly basic room ( twin ) and the beds were a little on the hard side for me, but it was very quiet and clean. Friendly staff. I would consider using this hotel again, though perhaps not for an extended stay of the city. The place is very nice and clean The staff were very friendly and helpful, my room was modern, perfectly clean and secure. Probably for all the places that I stay in Europe ,this place was the best for the money . Great location, good for business or solo travel.
Large hotel with plenty of rooms facing the swimming pools and beach. Great to sit on balcony and take in the view. We really enjoyed our stay  at this hotel. The staff could not be more helpful. The facilities especially the pools were terrific,very easy access to private beach. Great location, fantastic staff but needs to be refurbished it's stuck in the 80's We stayed here for three nights great location pools were nice one salt and one chlorine, nice comfortable chairs around the pool and decent pool service. Rooms were comfortable and we'll serviced food balcony with sea view   The huge issue they have is breakfast was cold every day, the breakfast on the plane was hotter and better. Although there were some nice people Cafe area there are a number that need to improve their attitude great clean place, great breakfast, good service from staff. Great hotel with good aminities and beach acceess. Rooms are a little old and out dated but still a good choice for a beach stay near Athens. Had a great stay at this Hotel and would love to go back there again. Staff are great and friendly and extremely helpful. A couple of points to make on arrival the mini bar in our room was very dirty so attention is needed. Bathroom can do with upgrade. We wanted to use the gym and were told to pay for it!!! The view from our balcony was beautiful. Overall was great. I am trying to find negative points, but cannot find except that both pools are too cold for me. I asked for late checkout for 2 rooms and it was granted without argumentation. Thank you so much I have stayed at the Divani hotels before. I come back because of the excellent service and facilities. The staff really make you feel special and the extras such as turning back the bedcovers in the evening or checking you if you need anything make all the difference. Highly recommend the Divani experience! A fresh water and saltwater pool and access to the beach. What else do you need to say. My family stayed in this hotel on the outskirts of Athens (Athens Riviera) for several nights in August 2017. It was fantastic. The hotel facility is beautiful. Our room was great with a spectacular view. The staff was lovely. The breakfast buffet was absolutely amazing. The hotel restaurants are terrific. And the outdoor facilities--the two swimming pools and the small sandy private beach--are divine. We would go back in a heartbeat. Good breakfast and friendly staff. Front desk gave us suggestion for free shuttle since we were leaving late. Thanks! Very comfortable , excellent food and service, wonderful spa and treatments. Nice room great view. Reception and beach staff was a bit snarky, pool staff were friendly. Was turned off a bit by the nickel and diming of having no complimentary water in room and adking 4€ for a bottle from the minibar. Most hotels of this caliber offer a few bottles daily. Will stay again. Location , friendly staff , clean , view, nice hotel by the see . Thank you ! I like this hotel as it has decent sized pools and plenty of open spaces. Can be a bit pricey for drinks and use of gym etc. The Divani was a great place to stay. Even though we visited during the off season the staff was very friendly and helpful meeting my family’s needs and arranged all the site seeing tours for us. Amazing location with amazing views. Beautiful place with friendly and efficient staff. The included breakfast is for for a gourmet. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The Sea view is awesome. This hotel was great for about $200 a night. Anything more than that is pushing it. Though the service was excellent, the hotel itself lacked the amenities that I feel a five-star hotel should have. Room was nice. Bathroom was a little dated as were the common hallways towards the rooms. If you like using a gym while on vacation, BE AWARE. The gym is non-existent. There are 4 machines located poolside of the indoor poolwhen I say poolside, I literally mean pool-side. The machines are literally placed where beach chairs should be WITHOUT any glass or wall dividing them form where people are swimming. Don't be fooled. You can NOT use this gym. There were a lot of families at the pool which does tell me it's very family friendly. Overall, I probably would stay here again but only of it's my cheapest option for a five star. Convenient location for the airport or Piraeus. Charming receptionists. Breakfast not up to Leading Hotels of the World. Lots of seaweed on the beach. Pool area very good. Drinks prices reasonable. Useful bus transportation to Glyfada and Athens. I love this hotel. Great service, location, ammenities. Pricey but worth it. Have stayed in dozens of hotels all over Greece over the years and this is my favorite one of all! Nice hotel, but food is way over priced! Lovely, relaxing, Beautiful room, view and service. If you want a quiet coastal stay in Athens, can’t be beat. Near airport and upscale shopping and boating. Private beach was excellent. Given bottle of Champaign for wedding anniversary   Breakfast excellent , staff friendly The location of the hotel is very good the staff are nice and friendly servce is very good I paid for an executive suite with a sea view thru Orbitz and was pleasantly surprised to get exactly what I purchased. The room was compact for the three of us and our luggage (2 adults, 1 child)- I would not recommend this room for a larger party. The bathroom had no tub and the sofa bed that had been laid out for my daughter had a very thin mattress so it was not very comfortable. The bed itself was comfortable, the toiletries plentiful and yummy, the towels thick and view amazing. The beach is tiny but if you are willing to walk there are nicer ones further down or use the other side of the one the hotel has. The pools were great and my daughter really loved both. The wifi could/should be better, some of the finishings in the open spaces of the floors could be better as well. However, all-in-all, I would love to return to the Divani. Staff was phenomenal Private beach is very small but very cool The outdoor pools are very nice The menu for the hotel restaurants are ok The rooms are dated and beds are uncomfortable. The hotel needs to be updated Good luck with wifi if you need it for work. It is complementary though. It's a nice hotel but for the price we paid, we expected a really nice hotel Great hotel in a beautiful location. Great staff and very welcoming We couldn't have asked for a better honeymoon trip. The hotel was beautiful, the staff was so friendly and willing to help. We felt so welcome and were treated lile royalty. The place was clean and we could tell they took pride in their employees. On numerous occassions the staff suggested where to eat and visit. We are so pleased to have found this slice of heaven on Greece! ! Excellent and friendly staff. Always very friendly. the perfect escape. big modern rooms. balconies with sea view from outside rooms. breakfast buffet with large selection. pools and ocean with food and drink service. if that is not enough there is the spa. will definitely be back. great hotel with friendly attentive staff. restaurant food choices good but food should be covered and hot items on some form of heater.
The doors of the dorms are extremely noisy and make it hard to sleep if you're the first one in bed or if someone needs to get up during the night. Good value for the price. The location is excellent just beside a large shopping mall and very close to the city centre. Very good. The breakfast available in 6 bucks wasn't good so better to eat at the food court in city centre. Booking online was easy. Checking into the room, coming and going was simple. The rooms were clean and in good shape. I didn't stay in the room very much because I had a lot to go out and do, but it all went very smoothly and comfortably. We had 6 people staying in a family room with ensuite, it was spacious, clean and comfortable even with 6 people. Air con worked well in the hot weather, it was pretty quiet except for kids hanging out in the car park outside the window in the evening (it was a Saturday night) but that wasn't too loud. The area felt safe despite the party atmosphere in the city Great location, very clean, good facilities and lots of separate areas to relax in. Loved the outdoor rooftop area and big indoor lounge areas. Lots of food storage and good size kitchen and dining area. Will definetly be back Nice hostel in walking distance to good shops And food and staff were very friendly and accommodating Easy access right on the heart of the city. Convenient, cost effective and easy to get around. Dirty and noisy rooms .dirty . Noisy rooms . Dirty toilers Easy to find. Great location was in 10 shared mixed dorm plenty of space. Good facilities only on issue door to ladies was a manoeuvring process as a little narrow. If you have a car make sure to arrange parking when booking. It's cheaper and very convenient. HELLO ALL BED IS VERY GOOD AND TV WITH SUPER TEXT WORD TV FOR DEAF READ IT ! ! The bathroom was very fealthy. Someone took a wee on the bathroom corridor floor. But No one cleaned The hostel itself is good. The price is not. For what you pay, the hostel is expensive conpared to other hostels I have stayed in. The location is good. Near restaurants, shops and general location is good. Bike hire  within the hostel was quite expensive, this could have been a standard for Canberra but compared to other cities expensive. I just put the higher cost of the hostel itself. Centrally located meant it was easy to travel to required venues. Minor concerns were the lack of bedside tables & centrally controlled heating/air conditioning made individual room control of temperature difficult. Booking direct is apparently cheaper. Young staff left me feeling my age. great room and facilities For the dom room the towel is BYO though the reception happily provided one free of charge when requested (apparently usually has a cost attached). No toiletries supplied. Great position for a YHA. It is in the middle of the city. Lots of shopping and car parking available if you book before hand. Beds are very comfy. Bathrooms are very small and not enough, they are always full. Tv room is also the sports centre and so almost impossible to watch tv. At night, the bar downstairs fills up and the place is rocking until 3 or 4 am with drunks. They also come upstairs and start slamming doors. Toilet door and bedroom doors slam all night so don't expect much sleep while you are here... the place is not soundproofed and our wall shakes when the door slams. However, the staff are great, facilities are good and as long as you don't have to work the next day, you will be fine. Upon checking in, I was offered only a top bunk. At my age, that is an accident waiting to happen during the night. I was not thrilled to fine I would be sharing a room with young men on my own. Nor was I taken by the very strange men hanging around the place in the four hours it took me to check in and check out. Lovely staff who were helpful and friendly. Nice facilities and great location Clean rooms and facilities. Friendly staff. Bike hire is gret. Very close to public transport to take you all over Canberra. I needed a relatively inexpensive place to stay near the Canberra CBD as I was travelling by myself for work and didn't plan on renting a car. Transport to and from the airport couldn't have been easier. Even though the hostel has public wifi I chose to purchase personal wifi for my room which made it convenient for work. Had a really nice stay and staff were amazing. Only downfall was the public bathroom and showers were not very clean. But nothing a bit of bleach couldn't fix. Everything else was great. Would definitely stay again. Staff really nice, next to the shops, all great. Room cleaned, bathrooms in great condition The best location it was please to stay in this hostel as very close to shopping center and staff are friendly,rooms are very net and tidy and beds are very comfort...... Overall it was clean and comfortable. However, I had issues with hot water (it became cold ~ 3 minutes after I turned it on), and the kettle had rusty bits in it so we couldn't quite use it. Location was pretty good as it is in the city. Price was reasonable too. Would go there again. Great Place to Stay considering the location and low price. There are several good venues to eat and drink in plus is next door to large shopping centre that has several high end fashion stores. It is easy to get to major attractions by bus or could hire an bicycle. The metal bed frames make this obnoxious squeaky noise which makes it difficult to sleep The family room with ensuite was large and clean. Great location A well kept hostel. Unbelievable location and clean rooms. Bit of a shame that there wasn't hostel wide free wifi but that isn;t really expected anyway. Canberra YHA is in an excellent location, right in town - walkable to restaurant, bars, shops etc. Not so handy if you have a car as there is no parkaing available however a little research helps with where to park your car - especially overnight. Staff are always helpful, you get to meet a range of people from all walks of life and all sorts of countries. The room was very good to our surprise we could of slept 2 extra people in our room, but this was not clear to us up front Our room would suit a family of six people. Staff assisted with accessing public transport. Staff reserved lower bunk when I was relocated to another room due to requirements of a large school group. Smell in the room and a disturbed night's sleep are my main gripes. However, if you are going to stay just for a couple of days it might be OK. Great size room, clean. Bed wasn't overly comfortable but not a problem for one night. Great location in CBD, good value for money. Clean and tidy and great value for money. Booking in again for next year's Running Festival for sure! Rooms are very small. Ok for a short stay only. Noisy at times. Not good cleanliness
Overall we really enjoyed this hotel. The Handy devise they provide is an excellent perk. The staff is extremely nice and the hotel is a very short walk to the Eiffel Tower. The only complaint I have is the shower. Although it was very nice, the water temp was impossible to regulate. One second you're freezing cold, and the next, without touching the regulator, your skin is melting off. Everything else was excellent. I did not try the breakfast due to the €18/person price tag. I had my phone stolen the minute we entered the train station. I didn't know what I was going to do for the rest of the trip but when we arrived at the hotel, to my surprise, one of the amenities they offer guest is the use of a smart phone to take pictures, use the internet and make international calls...all for free!!! I was able to call my family back home, call my phone provider and report it stolen and have use of a phone to help me navigate through this beautiful city. The room was clean, bed was comfortable and the mini fridge stocked everyday with soft drinks...again free of charge. The hotel was cute, trendy, and cozy. It was also very clean with modern decor. Small room count allowed for more personal attention and attention to detail. The team gave my daughter a thoughtful package to celebrate her turning 10. I am not fluent in French and the hotel staff was hospitable and helpful. The gentleman that works the afternoon and early evening shift is wonderful. Very kind. He taught me how to use Uber. He also made a wonderful dinner suggestion. We walked to the Eiffel Tower daily and this location was perfect. Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower was about 7 minutes. Beautiful architecture to see along the way. Area also felt safe to me. Someone is at the front desk 24 hours a day. Also, they have cute birds in the lobby entrance. I would recommend and stay again. The location for sightseeing couldn’t have been better — a quiet and pleasant neighbourhood just a few minutes’ walk from the Eiffel Tower and close to a metro stop (Dupleix). The free soft drinks in the room were a nice touch and the ‘Handy’ (free 4g handset for you to take out and about) proved invaluable when my teenaged son’s iPhone died mid-stay! There is a lovely supermarket right across the street too. Plus — it’s in Paris! What’s not to love?! ;) Good small centrally located hotel, staff great. Booked room only breakfast expensive in hotel at €18 per person but lots of nearby restaurants. If in future I booked this hotel direct would save 10% and get free breakfast. Only stayed for 1 night. Was comfortable and in a quiet neighborhood. Exceptional service from start to finish! Celebrated my birthday in Paris. Had a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for me in my room. Robert was exceptional, great customer service from everyone. Very close to the Eiffel Tower...walking distance. About 1hr from CDG by taxi. Location was perfect for my 2 days. Beds were very comfortable. Will certainly stay here again. Good hotel and all the staff is very helpful specialty reception staff Amazing staff and lovely room. View not great but otherwise perfect. Very close to Tower, convenient location for tourists. Great hotel for a City break. Really close to a major Metro station and also the Eiffel Tower. Also lots of Restaurants/Bars around the area. Staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful and the general homely feel of the Hotel may you really feel at ease. Would DEFINITELY stay here again! We were there for 4 nights, it was a great place to be, small and convenient. Very nice and very clean hotel, the staff were very polite and helpful. The hotel is close to the Eiffel Tower and the metro station which made it easy to get around the city. I definitely recommend. Incredibly helpful staff, lovely hotel in a quiet street but very close to attractions, cafes and bars. Don’t miss the Sunday market under the bridge. 5 minute walk from Eiffel Tower. Check in was quick. staff was nice. Bathroom soaps and lotions were nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Relatively close to the Eiffel Tower. Not really any views, but the room was nice and they give you a cell phone to use during your stay, in case you don’t want to use roaming on yours We spent the first four nights of a 15-day trip to France here, and it was a great way to start the trip. The hotel is on a quiet street and has a good location near the Eiffel Tower, restaurants, and metro stations, and there is a boulangerie right next door. The room was bright, clean, and comfortable, and there were many outlets for your electrical needs. The staff was warm and welcoming. There is a lovely outdoor lounge area we would have liked to have used more, but the bar area is a little sparse. The location is awesome. As far as the hotel I must say the beds are awful. I have never slept on a bed so hard. If you like a hard bed, this is the place for you. The TV was also awful. We told the staff that the English channels were not working and it was never fixed. We stayed for 4 nights and asked them about it several times, they did not know what to do and never have us an explanation. It’s not the end of the world, but when you come back to your room at the end of the night, it’s nice to be able to turn on the TV and see what’s going on in the world. When we go back to Paris, we will not stay at this hotel. When you spend what we spent, you expect more than what we got. Had a fantastic two-night break here over Valentine's. The room was great, there was a great effort made for Valentines, towel swans with hearts scattered around them, heart ballons, macarons, champagne, it really was special! There was a slight smell of smoking in the room when I entered, but I didn't notice it after half an hour or so. Great size room, could see the top of the Eiffel Tower! Supermarket across the road, great restaurants round the corner, two metro line stations within walking distance, so great neighbourhood. Short walk to the Eiffel Tower and across the river. Loved the birds in the foyer, shame we didn't get a chance to try the cocktails, next time for sure! I'd definitely come back here again. Thanks for a great stay! Awesome place! I will come back again! My girlfriend also like the place The front desk staff was very helpful and the hotel is located down the street from the metro which was very convenient. The room was very clean and comfortable. Great location at 2 minutes from Eiffel, my room was clean, calm and super functional. The staff is very helpful. Really nice room, very friendly and helpful staff. We had a great experience. Lovely hotel walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and all the site seeing places like champs-Élysées, arc de triompe, and so many more. We would definitely return soon. Thank you for making our stay in Paris a great one. Ps, the Eiffel Tower gummies they have there are the best! ! Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower- about 10 min. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. Small hotel which is what we wanted for an overnight stay in Paris. I would return for sure. Nice old Parisian building close to the Eiffel Tower. Staff friendly. Rooms nice. Only problem is the breakfast. Expensive and full of sugar. Coffee undrinkable. Croissants disappointing considering in the heart of Paris. We stayed at the Marquis Eiffel for our Christmas vacation and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, we had a small view of the Eiffel Tower, it's close to some restaurants, across the street from a grocery, and the metro is just a short walk. we were also thrilled to have a cell phone available for use as it was our main source of getting around the city successfully. We will definitely be staying here again should our travels take us back to Paris! Loved the neighborhood! Lots to do - shops, cafes, bike tours - and the Eiffel tower and nearby activities were so close! Did get a room with a balcony over the street, and another room on the top floor with a view of the Eiffel, so had the best of both experiences! My wife and I flew over to run the Paris Marathon. We booked two hotels and by far Le Marquis was our favorite. Centrally located we were able to get around the city so well. I highly recommend! The hotel is nice. Arround three o'clock in the morning I heard the my locked door opens. I asked who was it I coul see a shadow of aman he continued to enter the bedroom. I screamed so loud and got up he left. I informed the receptionist and could not sleep the rest of the night I think it was arranged Treated very well by the staff and loved having a phone provided with gps to get around, also able to call cabs with it very pleasant stay, it want you to come back as soon as possible to enjoy more time, even if it is just a night or two. Location of hotel is perfect. Near Eiffel tower but out of the way. Clean sheets and room but carpeting could use some cleaning. Overall a very good place. Staff very helpful. Very nice and clean room and bathroom ! Receptionist and other hotel staff were friendly. Location is great. Really close to metro and walking distance to Eiffel Tower. Great location at 2 minutes from Eiffel, my room was clean, calm and super functional. The staff is very helpful.
Nice hotel located a little far from the train station. Hotel caters for weddings. I booked twin room (2 beds) as I have young kids I was given 2 single rooms look like our room was given to wedding guests. Also booked non smoking and given smoking rooms. Booked months ahead no choice but to seperate family between two rooms. Staff are nice. Taxis cost about 1500 yen from the station otherwise a bus at station 5 can be caught for 220 yen. If walking approx 50 min.
Another fantastic experience at the Hospes Amerigo - this is the only Hotel that we stay at when we visit Alicante. Amazing staff, fabulous hotel and location. short break which was very nice. The hotel experience + staff were all very good. Hotel staff couldn’t have been more helpful. The breakfast is delicious and the bed was so comfy it has made us realise we need a new one! We stayed in a family room (essentially two adjoining rooms). Staff were very efficient and friendly and fresh fruit placed in the room every afternoon. There a plenary of restaurants within short walking distance of the hotel and just one block to the seafront area. All major attractionsand the tram are also within easy walking distance. Very good room and experience, no real view from room. Located  2 blocks away from the Esplanada and marina and within a short walking distance of the beach. Could not have asked for a better location. This hotel is in a great location. It is within walking distance of the beach and it’s in the town. The reception staff are brilliant and attentive. The room is very clean and comfortable with many amenities. We will definitely be back to stay in this beautiful hotel. BRILLIANT STAFF ESPECIALLY RECEPTIONIST AND ELEENA THE RECEPTIONIST We stayed for 4 nights early April. Welcome from staff brilliant as were all the staff. Breakfast good standard and catered for my gluten free diet. Tapas bar at hotel was good and food delicious. Brilliant location for explore the local area on foot. Pool area in roof top perfect for a relax in the heat and a swim. Lovely and clean and a bar The staff were excellent throughout our stay. The hotel is well placed in Alicante a lovely place to come back to. This is a great place to stay in Alicante, it is in the heart of the old town surrounded by restaurants and bars, no car required just a 5 minute walk to the beach. The hotel is comfortable with a touch of class, the rooftop area is perfect to relax, drink snack sunbathe take a dip or use the small gym and Newley refitted sauna. I have been before and will definitely be back. We had a lovely stay at this hotel, an oasis away the bustling Alicante activity outside. It wasn’t a complete 5 star experience staff were very welcoming. rooms spacious and very clean and fresh looking, as you would expect for this standard f hotel. This is the place to stay in Alicante, our second time in this hotel. Hotel has a modern, cool vibe and neighborhood is just right for eating, relaxing and window shopping. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Room was small but extremely comfortable because the bathroom (double sink) and storage were spacious. It was generally clean but they really need to do a better job of dusting everywhere. There was a large soaking tub in the room fitted with a shower, which was particularly uncomfortable to use. If you have mobility issues it may be hard to get in and out so I would ask about the availability of a shower. The hotel tapas bar was very good and service was excellent. Lovely hotel and staff. Great stay, drinks and food. Room service effcient. Only issue was creaking beds with not so good matresses and a differnce in height between the 2 (2 singles put together) Nice hotel with very attentive staff. The bathroom however is very badly designed. It's a real climb to get in and out of the bath/shower and the marble floor is extremely slippy. Great location  Be careful of extra charges like parking Hotel loveley and in a fantastic location. My only gripe was the tapas restaurant, the service was really slow onve they had a few customers in there. But saying that, the food was lovey. Spa facilities were very good; relaxing and varied services offered. Sun area a little on the tight side on the top floor when busy and the pool water was pretty cold each time we checked it. Staff were excellent, could not do enough for you and gave excellent restaurant recommendations. Bar staff also very friendly and obliging. Food was very good with a great selection for breakfast offered. Luxurious hotel in a perfect location would certainly recommend and would stay again. If you book this hotel, please arrange for parking, which is very limited. If you are sensitive to noise, book an inside room, and even then, hallways are very noisy! Staff could not have been more accommodating, and breakfast was delicious. Overall a lovely hotel. Hotel staff were nice. We arrived early and it was no problem. Even left something behind and they posted it to me. We stayed in room 310 I would not classify it as double as it is rather on the small size and with no city view from the window. The staff is excellent and offered us another room The price is rather on the high side for the room  I would not say it is 5 stars, it is a good 4 stars I would check other hotels before I book this one
Ive stayed at a few Four Seasons properties in the past. My boyfriend and I were contemplating this hotel for a smaller boutique design hotel for a while but decided on the Four Seasons in the end due to the price, location and square footage of the room. We were a bit sceptical of the decor and were looking for something slightly “trendier” like the HABITA Hotel. But much to our surprise, we were completely blown away by the quality of service we experienced at the Four Seasons. Every member of staff went above and beyond to make our stay special. The hotel itself was completely renovated recently and not worn down in the slightest. The quality and food at the hotel in both the room service and at its restaurants were also of highest quality. Overall everything was extremely reasonably priced and the level of service we experienced was extraordinary. Will definitely be back. We've been going to Mexico City for 25+ years. The Four Seasons is by far the most comfortable and welcoming hotel. The staff attends happily and professionally to all of your needs before you even arrive if you email them. We were welcomed by gracious doormen and the Director of Guest Relations who led us to our room and checked us in personally. The room was just what we asked for. (Ask for one facing the courtyard on a high floor.) The food in the restaurants is exceptional and the staff very attentive and polite. The concierge staff was also extremely helpful. Everyone was very welcoming. The hotel is convenient to everything.This is the place to stay if you want a first-rate, no hassle time in Mexico City. This was a phenomenal hotel -the courtyard is fabulous, the pictures do not do it justice. It is huge, very relaxing, with tons of flowers, palm trees, vegetation, twinkling lights -truly magical. It was the perfect place for breakfast or a drink with friends, and offered quiet spots to read or work. The hotel staff are incredibly attentive and welcoming -superb service all around. Our room was attended to very well every day. Very quiet, comfortable rooms, good sized bathrooms. Room service is friendly. We would definitely return. The staff at the Four Seasons is excellent, as you would expect. The hotel itself is older, which has pros and cons. It is nice that it is built around a huge central courtyard, with all rooms on the inside of the halls, no rooms on the street sides. The rooms are spacious. We stayed in the Terrace Room, of which there are apparently only two. The ceilings are at least 12', maybe higher, and the room has french doors leading to a large terrace. However, this room is over the restaurant area, and there is a lot of noise in the middle of the night. Sounds like wheels going across a floor. There is an excellent bakery, and the staff there is very professional and friendly. Unfortunately that was not the case in the main restaurant. We had dinner there the first night, and our waiter was terrible. He acted like he was doing us a favor by waiting on us, we didn't even know there were specials until we overheard another waiter at the next table, and he practically ignored us. We did not go back. The bar is very nice, with excellent bartenders executing craft cocktails. The hotel is close to the castle and park, but more in a financial district than right in downtown Polanco district,  Because of this I would probably not stay there again for vacation. The hotel is beautiful and clean. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. We arrived at 7 am and they gave us a room at 8 am without an extra charge. We also asked for a late check-out and they allowed us to check-out at 2pm instead of noon without an extra charge. The courtyard was beautiful but it was especially nice at night. I would definitely return to the Four Seasons. Excellent hotel and location. Very professional and helpful staff. Food was wonderful. This hotel is what luxury stands for. Our stay was excellent, the rooms are super comfortable, the bed is amazing. Highly recommended!! ! Fantastic hotel. A great hub from which to explore the city. The Very Best.The Sunday Brunch was Amazing. Best Spa/ Massage in Mexico City. One of the best in Mexico City. Staffs are really nice and helpful. My baggage was lost in transit. On arrival the staff were very supportive in locating my baggage. Offer of assistance was greatly appreciated. Facilities and staff are all exceptional. A perfect introduction to Mexico. Spent five nights at the Four Seasons and really enjoyed our stay. Nice comfortable rooms, friendly staff, good food in a terrific location. Would highly recommend it. I loved this hotel. Perfectly located in the center of town. Great boulevard which is closed on Sundays to ride bikes, great street food two blocks away, incredible food and service in the hotel. The staff are what you come to expect from a true 5 star hotel. They were perfect, caring, happy, and made the Mexico City experience outstanding. Many thanks to everyone at the Four Seasons, Mexico City. Hotel was super chic, cute, and spacious. We completely adore the staff, extremely attentive and fun to talk to. However, our pillows gave us neck pains for our entire stay. My fault for not alerting them, I am sure they wouldve fixed it for us. Housekeep cleaned our room twice every single day. If you want to grab a drink, go for one of their unique cocktails. Sooooo delicious!!!! We are coming back!! ! I had a fantastic stay! The hotel was beautiful and in a very convenient area. I will definitely return. everyone is bend-over-backwards friendly and helpful in a genuine way. much needed when you want to just rest and enjoy a vacation in a new place. Very comfortable hotel with a superb location next to Chapultepec Park. Excellent Spa with pool, jacuzzi, and sauna. Restaurant food is pretty good, if quite expensive. I had an absolutely fantastic stay here in August of this year while visiting for business purposes. I was able to secure a Reforma suite through a buy 2 nights get 1 free promotion, which made the suite a great value. The room was luxuriously appointed, and I felt very at home. The Nespresso machine as a nice touch. Room service was very reasonably priced coming from the US, and the food was phenomenal. I also got drinks at the bar in the hotel, which is a beautiful space with a fantastically unique menu. The cocktails are very, very pricey, but well worth it if you're looking for something special to imbibe. I recommend the mezcal drink that comes with ground Oaxacan ants as an ingredient. The location of the hotel is unbeatable. You can walk to plenty (although I only recommend this during the daylight hours), and you're a quick Uber (which is outrageously cheap) to everything. You're also a quick walk to my favorite quick food stop, Califa Tacos. Simply the most delicious. The staff is bilingual, and you won't have any issues communicating if coming from America. The hotel grounds are also great. The sauna was phenomenal, and the outdoor pool area manages to inject some tranquility into the heart of the bustling metropolis. The only let down of my stay involved transportation. I booked a car service from the airport to the hotel through Four Seasons. An old Nissan was sent for me, and I felt it was not at all worth the $105 charge. FS could improve this. Great room and dining facilities. Very friendly reception, bar and restaurant service. Area could have been closer to city centre action. Amazing service. Great bar. Solid restaurant. The hotel staff was extremely helpful in booking a dinner and day trip for us. Will definitely come back. Amazing Lupita and Joatzin. Rest Management made my stay wonderful... Front Desk forgettable mechanical everyone one else leave up to the name brand Amazing Stay, only downside the Wifi that did not work to our satisfaction. Our stay exceeded our expectations! Gorgeous hotel- we especially loved the bar and lobby areas. The hot chocolate and cookies were my favorites, as well as the adorable cafe/bakery. The concierge team was so helpful. They truly helped make my birthday trip a memorable weekend! Very well located ... staff is extraordinary...First time in long time, that the bar in a five star hotel is a Five Star Bar!!! ! Absolutely great hotel - would strongly recommend. You get what you expect at the Four Seasons, impeccable service and accommodations! This hotel is going through a renovation right now that reduces the quiet, the amenities and the serenity of the hotel to that of a 2 star hotel. Waiting lists for the reduced size restaurant, noise from 9am - 6pm, paint smells in the rooms, degassing carpets in the renovated rooms all make for a most unpleasant stay. Hopefully it will return to its previous standards next year when all is done but for now stay away. My daughter and I stayed at the Four Seasons for my birthday. Everyone so courteous and friendly. The staff went out of their way to be so helpful and informative. I was surprised by a cake in our room for my birthday. And a happy birthday note. Great Experience! The hotel is awsome, with nice rooms and excelent views. Absolutely recommendable Bed are really uncomfortable. Also, housekeeping was not perfect. Some days they forget to put towels and water. But other than these everything was perfect Hotel and staff were all great! Definitely will stay here again in the future. Arturo our tour guide was the best and super knowledgeable about Mexico City and it’s wonderful history. We experencied issues with poor service at bar, poor service in food, poor service with concierge. The standards of four season are higher than what we experienced at this property having stayed at many others Lovely hotel within walking distance of shops, restaurants (El Califa tacos!) and a block or so away from Chapultepec Park. Great service, staff are extremely friendly, and speak English well.
I used this hotel to visit Trentham Gardens and the Monkey Forest. Situation seemed a little urban due to its proximity to the A50 and a 24 hour Tesco store, but venturing out to the country pubs in the evening was painless and could be achieved without using the A50. A little further from Trentham than I initially wanted but the price was good and the route to my chosen visitor attraction was straightforward. Great for visiting World of Wedgewood too and the early breakfast buffet (before 9.00 a.m.) at the adjoining Hungry Horse restaurant was surprisingly good and well presented with organic yoghurts, quality granola and a lovely fruit compote amongst other items. Don't worry if you miss the 9.00 a.m. deadline, as bespoke breakfast options are available for a later start. Hotel was quiet despite its setting (near to a McDonalds too) and I had a peaceful night in a comfortable bed with plenty of hot water when required. Easy check in, very pleasant receptionist. 1st room given was unsuitable as toilet seat hanging off, 2nd room ok but spoilt by fan/vent clicking on and off every minute (reception aware of this problem). There were 3 of us staying in this room at £80 a night and for this I would have expected a shower gel and shampoo each for each night but this was not given, only got one of each , extra supplies were given on request Stayed for one night before an Alton towers trip with two kids under 3. Room was clean comfortable and reasonably spacious. The restaurant was fantastic quality and value for money. The outside play area is an added bonus and there are activities indoors for kids too! Staff were very welcoming and made our stay at the hotel lovely. Nice, basic, clean hotel but on both nights we stayed, sleep was disturbed by noise from the corridors and outside the hotel, we won't stay here again. The hotel although a little bit from town is very close to Macdonalds and next door to the hungry horse so cheap dining and child friendly places are near by the hungry horse has quite popular play area for kids but the hotel is nice and sedate. Excellent staff. Food and prices good   Will stay again The hotel was a little far out for what we were looking for, its very tired and dated, wouldnt come back Not a lot to say really. It was a clean bed for the night. And ultra handy for where I needed to stay. And because of its position I would use again. I didn't sleep particularly well. But I don't think many do the first night away from home. There was no room service  No aircon Parking is limited  No fridge in the room to keep baby's milk Stayed here on the 26 th August for a family wedding ,staff very nice room was lovely  most of family stayed 3 days but we stayed 1 the hotel has a hungry horse attached to it alcoholic drinks fine but found cola / lemonade on dear side meals were nice , most of family met up and ate at hungry horse on the Friday, would definitely recommend this place . Thank you to staff at the great western the weathervane we had a lovely time. The hotel its self was decently clean. We didn't like that when we checked in we had to call someone to come to the front desk and the phone was not working properly. It took someone seeing us in the bar to know who to find to check us in. My booking couldn't be found but with my paperwork & checking that the payment had go though was given my key. It took no time to sort out & I was not make to feel that it was my problem. Very well handed. Myself and my partner were only looking for a short stay as we was off to Alton Towers, it was an half hour drive, close to shop's & eateries. Staff were more than helpful as we arrived a couple hours early, they got us in a room straight away. In the restaurant attached to the hotel was excellent staff, very helpful and quick service. Hotel staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Breakfast was very good. The room was comfortable and there was evidence of some refurbishment but a little more would be helpful. Bathroom was looking a little outdated although functional - brilliant shower. Nice hotel with friendly staff. Lively resturant and bar atmosphere at the weekend when we were there Could not stay had to go back to work not stayed. Could not stay had to go back to work not stayed Easy to find. Plenty of choice of eating places nearby if needed. Booked through Expedia. Booking agent assured me breakfast at 7am on Saturday. Had 3 hr drive +10hr working day and was told at check in breakfast at 8.00am. As I had to be at an event at 8am I had to get up at 6.00am in order to find a supermarket to buy breakfast. Helpful Hotel. Not so Expedia. On arriving at the hotel which was late evening we were met by a desk with no colleague to welcome us but instead a sign saying to use the phone to call for a colleague to attend. This is not a warm and friendly welcome to the hotel. Once a colleague had arrived we were given a friendly service and quickly given our key and directions to our room. The room itself is a standard room but could do with the walls being repainted. We also noticed that the window was broken. Not a issue with us as we can sleep through pretty much anything but a concern if a kids were staying in the room as it was the top floor. The window did not lock. We also found our toilet did not flush. With this we informed the colleagues and one came up to look into the two issues. The window could not be fixed but we were told that it would be logged for repair. The toilet flush was fixed by the colleague only for us to find in the morning it had stopped working again. The bed was perfectly comfortable and in all fairness one of the best sleeps I have had in a hotel. During checkout at around 7am we were again met by no colleague at the desk and again had to use the phone to call someone. We again were met by this time a different colleague who helped us checkout and we updated on the toilet issue. We were promised this would be looked into. During the stay all colleagues were friendly and as helpful as possible. They could not offer another room as the hotel was fully booked. it was a dated hotel, noisy due to being On a nearby major road, cold rooms with poor heating control. It’s was a warm, clean and quiet room. The receptionist was very helpful. Comfortable, clean, and the restaurant next door is excellent No problems at all, good standard of accommodation, breakfast ok although not a great choice. Room was Clean. Otherwise basic Lovely staff, good food in the adjoining restaurant, and a nice sized comfortable room! I stayed here for business so the location was ideal for me, although the local area isn’t the most exciting - we struggled to find many places to eat nearby other than the hotel and an Indian (which was lovely!). I was generally very happy with the service and my stay. Although the room was comfortable, the floor boards above were very creaky. We were unfortunate enough to have someone above us who was up several times throughout the night and up and about at 7 am, so we didn't get a good nights sleep. I would return but ask for the top floor next time. Attached restaurant was not up to the standard of the hotel. Food mediocre and limited choice. Friendly , clean, felt quite safe would visit other Grt Western Hotels else where
This place was terrible. Parking was awful an dangerous. People were out in the parking lot all hours of the night hollering and cussing. There was a 1 inch gap underneath the entrance door which was an exterior entrance. The beds were hard as rocks and the bathroom was way too small. The television kept shutting off on us. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. My husband is a police officer and he slept with his gun on the bed out of the holster every night because of all the riff raff that was in the parking lot. When I pay for a room I want one that I feel safe at and this one was not it. Greeted and checked in by Manager John I think was his name warm and welcoming even though we only stayed 1 night it was descent. Room clean bug free bathroom was small but it did the job outdoors upon check out horrible smell like a meth lab cooking up on the front side of the hotel we were on second floor I almost had an instant asthma attack but other that that being the worst about the hotel I would definitely stay again and possibly even work there if I lived in the area just a real nice front desk staff! ! Very clean rooms, hotel staff were very friendly and made it a quick check in, it was quite which made for a good nights sleep, close to everything, I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to family and friends Room being convenient was the high point. Room was just OK. I’ve def seen worse but sure wasn’t best. We needed something to accommodate several so that’s why we chose it. King bed, queen bed and bunks in room. I would probably stay there again. Happy travels!! ! Room was very clean. Cold air conditioner. Pet friendly hotel. Welcome binder included a list of pet friendly spots in Pigeon Forge. Very friendly staff. We were very pleased. Breakfast was next door at Reagan’s Pancake House. You receive vouchers for free pancake breakfast, or you can upgrade to full breakfast buffet for $5. It was delicious. Website describes breakfast, however breakfast is not included Check in was good. Room was clean. Had to get a couple extra towels but can't complain. We woke up and could not swallow and our throats were sore. The room was so dry and there was no fan in the bathroom. The comfort was not very good for the room. It was in a very good location however. Probably will find a different one next time. It was a pleasant stay. The location was great for walking to many different shops and attractions. We went for President's Day weekend, so the hotel was packed ND parking was limited though there was more across the street behind the hotel. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was at diner next door where there was a wait. Pancakes and drink included or $5 for the buffet. Overall good stay Our stay was great! The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodated our needs. The rooms was very clean and comfortable. The hotel is located in the center of the parkway which made everything accessible. Great place and we will definitely stay here again. Loved the hotel the cleanliness, close to everything and the room was very comfortable. The only hotel that had 3 double beds in one room. Clean. No issues. The breakfast is good, they give you vouchers for Reagans pancake house next door to the hotel. Very good breakfast. Friendly staff. Quiet hotel. Seemed okay at first. Got to our room and there are cracks ALL along the door big enough to fit your hand into on all sides so people could see in and we could see out of the room. Heard EVERYTHING the whole night. Trucks, conversations, rain, busy highway. Also the conjoining doors are a pain. The kids next to us who weren't being supervised by their parents banged on it all weekend trying to open it. Annoying. Better off sleeping outside. We rented a cabin in the mountains but because of the zero below weather and ice that was coming through Saturday night, we decided to get hotel rooms in Pigeon Forge. We had our Yorkie with us so we knew the hotel had to be pet friendly. We called and Red Roof Inn allowed pets so we chose there. The rooms were very nice and clean. The closest was a good plus,, but the beds were hard as a rock. Had to keep asking for more towels to accommodate my party of five, and they had scratches on the walls and on the bathroom door and walls from somebody's dog. hotel is basic but has connected with a restaurant next door where you can get a free breakfast. Very pleased with our room and our stay. I stayed with my 2 sons and our dog. The front desk staff was fantastic, friendly and very helpful with information on our next visit. I will definitely stay here again. I had a family emergency and they would not let me have my money back they still took it out which is a bunch of BS I understand if it was some stupid and I was just didn’t want to come but it wasn’t so don’t ever book a hotel room with them unless you’re for sure you better make it or just go and try to find the one when you get down there I will never stay at this hotel again thanks They put us in a room that had a leak in the bathroom. The bathroom floor was wet I immediately notified the front desk in which I was told they was full and had not other room to switch us too..One of the  ladies came over to see the leak. That morning I went to the front office to talk with the General Manager in which he came to the room and again there was no where to put us. I do not know it it was toilet water or what. The GM asked when I was leaving and he would make a adjust on my bill. When I checked  out three days later I was given a $60.00 credit on my bit of over $400 dollars. I wasn't even given a nights credit for them coming in and out of my room I assume checking the leak coming from the ceiling draining down the side of the wall in the bathroom. The office staff the ladies that checked us in was very nice and friendly  they also apologized for not having any where else to put us but assure me that the GM would adjust the bill for my family inconvenience. Now lets talk about the restaurant where they gave me breakfast voucher to eat the waitress bumped my chair and dropped a full tray of drinks unto my family and the tables around us and no manager or anyone else came to apologize they cleaned up the mess and kept it moving. After tossing drinks unto my clothing  I paid my full bill because all they offer you are pancakes and a soda for breakfast not the buffet, Would I recommend this hotel No I would not. I will never stay here again. Room was on the 3rd floor, no elevator, not fun for 2  eighty yr. olds!! Would not stay there again. Three queens beds was ideal for myself, husband and 2 teenagers. Very polite guest services. We left behind important item and the associate was so nice to look for it and call me back. First time at this hotel and I loved it! Staff was very friendly, rooms were updated and clean. Price was great! We will definitely stay here again! The hotel is in a great location...within walking distance to almost everything including the island! My kids and I had a great experience all together! The hotel itself could use a little refresher, but all in all I would stay here again! Clean, comfy and safe! The cleaners didn’t change any of our trash cans and had to do it ourselves. The building was dirty and pets being there didn’t help. The rooms were very small. I’ve stayed in many red roof inns and this was by far the worst one. Very friendly and beds were very comfortable. Staff was great and hotel was in an excellent location. Overall the room was clean and well taken care of but did notice a strange hole in the floor by the door. Shower pressure wasn’t great but workable. Would have preferred steps instead of ramp but it did make it easier for wheeled luggage. I love that the room did not have carpet. You can tell that the property is older but the room was in good condition. Great location. Pet friendly hotel with large rooms and close to everything This hotel is everything you need location wise, a little bit of an older Hotel, but very pet friendly. The location was wonderful. We enjoyed our stay! The pancake breakfast next door was also a nice surprise, and came with our room. Comfortable, clean, great location, hreat staff Blankets were to thin and light. Kept sliding off the bed with any movement. Beds were a little too firm. It's was great cheap place to stay, parking sucked. Wish we got assigned spots. It was close to alot of attractions. Walking distance to food and family fun. DO NOT DO THE DISCOUNTED TICKETS THEY OFFER AT CHECK IN. they claim it's not time share a d you'll be in and out in 90m but we were there for over 2 hours arguing. Then after we had previously paid for our discounted tickets the day before,  they tried to hold them at the meeting Hotel staff was friendly and helpful during check in and check out. Very quick. The outside building needs a little work. The elevator was nasty dirty. We only used it once. My husband made the comment hope the room don't look like this. Room was clean, smelled good. Hot water and comfortable bed. Room itself was great. Housekeeping did a great job making up our room the 1st day. Left a tip for her the 2nd day but no one showed up. We didn't eat the breakfast there. We were told we had to show a card to eat and couldn't take it out of the breakfast area. Normally my husband will go down and get me something little while I got ready for the day and eat it in our room. Thst was not allowed. And the breakfast , area is very small. Not much room. We took advantage of the many restaurants in the area. Location was good. Stay there again? Probably not. There are so many other hotels in the area to try. I was really not sure ofthe hotel when I booked it with the Travelocity agent but when I arrived and was greeted by the hotel staff I was very pleased. They were friendly and handled our every need. We were given room 219 upstairs away from the pool until my kid said could we please have a room by the pool. The guy was like sure no problem at all. He gave us a bottom room directly across from the pool. The room was amazing and updated. The location was awesome. I will recommend and will book in the future. Thanks Red Roof staff and travelocity. Booked through Travelocity after arrival got a better deal. When Traveling to this area in the winter better prices can be gotten off the street. The staff was very pleasant and did all they could to make us happy. The beds and pillows were extremely firm almost HARD. The Floors are laminate wood and are very cold. Better have house-shoes. The heater was either hot or cold. The fan never shut off so when the heat was on it blew very hot and when it was off it blew cold. The stay was very warming and safe. Normally I do not feel safe in any hotel. This one was the best experience I have ever had staying in a hotel. The staff was wonderful. They were very nice and very respectful. The room was clean. The room was very nice as well. I will for sure stay there for my upcoming birthday :) Thank you for your time and effort. This hotel is in a good location and the price was fairly reasonable, however, it needs some updating. Patched holes in the walls were poorly painted. The toilet was running all night and when we reported it they did not get it fixed during our 2 night stay. The laundry room is very nice. Breakfast was good. Maid service was not good. Probably would not recommend this hotel. Staff was nice breakfast was great all was good but NO WI -FI in my room said they would look in to it if they fix it I would go back if fixed other wise no return Was very nice would stay there again  definitely worth the money needed more than one parking  space  and the staff work it out for me This place was really nice for the price. It looked a little older so there was some wear that just comes with age, but it was all clean. The staff were all extremely friendly, and we had free parking and breakfast. Plus, it's really close to a lot of Pigeon Forge attractions like the go-karts, shopping, food, lazer tag, and not far at all from Dollywood. Overall, I'd stay there again! We had a great stay we wiould stay here again. Clean  comfortable We stayed for Memorial Day weekend, and enjoyed the hotels perfect location on the Parkway. Upon arriving, check in was excellent, and we got directions to our room. When we entered our room, it was clean and free of any odors. After making an 8hr drive, we were ready for bed. Unfortunately, the beds there are horrible! It felt like we slept on the floor the whole weekend. We didnt sleep well at all our whole tripe. The bathroom is extremely small with barely any lighting in there too. Parking is atrocious if you dont arrive early. Not sure how breakfast was, as we didnt eat there. We also couldnt connect to the WiFi, and most channels on our TV wouldnt come in. We probably wont stay again due to the uncomfortable mattresses. It was an okay stay the room was fairly clean but it could have been a lot better they were exposed wires underneath the sink the sheets and the beds were clean and very comfortable staff not so much friendly the phone did not work had to ask to fix it and they still did not fix it the ice machine did not work. Housekeeping came in made the beds but that's pretty much all they did they didn't replenish anything that was needed in the room I had to go down to the front desk and ask for what I needed. The front desk was told but nothing was done about it. The Motel was super, location, friendly staff, the only thing I would recommend is more variety at the breakfast. Went 2 get married. The hotel wuz right n the center of all the hot spots. Great location. Staff wuz very friendly & helpful. The hotel was nice and clean. The room was clean the bed was big and comfortable. It was sad that my husband and I couldn't really enjoy the scenery... There was a forest fire... I will be back there I had a great time and i will be back..staff were so excellent and the hotel was very clean.. It was great. It was convenient with everything. We got to spend time with my daughter and son in law. They've never been there and they said they wil be back. So it was all great and beautiful and we plan to go back in the fall. Room was clean, seems like it had been remodeled... Was pleased with staff, they were extra friendly... Beds were a little firm, but other than that, great stay. I was sorry they put us in the room with carpet. The musty smell was in the carpet. They had plenty of rooms available with out carpet. I think they must save those rooms for guests with pets. I should have asked for a change when I first opened the door and the smell hit me in the face. The breakfast was not very good. Biscuits were hard. Scrambled eggs were dry. So we went out to eat. The staff was very friendly but the room was dirty and very loud. Breakfast was not good and the bathroom was disgusting. Staff was wonderful and friendly. Pets stay free which was a plus for us in taking our fur baby. Rooms were super clean and comfortable. Where they are located is in a very convenient spot in walking distance to several attractions. Very pleased overall! !
Great staff, newly renovated room with fabulous view onto th Rhine river. Spectacular breakfast terrace overlooking the river. Very conveniently located in walking distance to downtown and Rhine promenade as well as metro. Fast free internet, but in contrast to US, that's almost standard in Germany. Everything very good - modern comfort and super bathroom. Excellent choice for breakfast although 19 Euros was a little bit pricey. The hotel looks freshly decorated with comfortable rooms overlooking river Rhine. Definitely will stay again there. Fantastic location with views over the Rhine and with the good summer weather we were able to benefit from drinks and breakfast on the terrace. Accommodation of a high standard and staff unfailingly pleasant and helpful. Breakfast not cheap, but good value for money if you want the full range of items, which were of very good quality and constantly replenished. Hotel staff was very helpful with directions to our rental car return. Delightful to sit out on the terrace and enjoy a beer in the afternoon. Easy to find based on the directions on the website which is very helpful after a long day of driving. Would definitely recommend to others and would choose the hotel again for personal travel. I would have liked to be able to make a hot drink in my room but hotel was excellent Hotel has lovely Rhine River position and is close to city center. Room was run down ( no drawer in one side table etc) Bathroom poorly laid out without bath ( no shower caps are provided) and door with a hole in it from banging on towel rail. Room with courtyard views have no tea/coffee making facility .On a cold Saturday winter night at 9pm it was both difficult and unpleasant to get a cup of coffee. Very nice hotel , but I have walking problems , and even small steps can be a problem. Perhaps a small ramp to the rooms 150 could be installed? The hotel is really nice and the staff are very nice and helpful. The room is nice and clean and well presented. However I couldn't sleep well as the rooms are not insulated well and the next door to us had a dog in the room which was not stated on the website that the guests are allowed to have pets in their room. so that was the only complaint I have otherwise we had a great time. Excellent service and lovely stay... underground parking is very convenient Really lovely stay. Felt luxurious. The beds were wonderful. Really close to the old town, on the Rhine, good bar, nice parks - just lovely.
This was our 3rd trip to Disney in 12 years. On the first two, we stayed at the Allstar music and Pop century, happy both times, but wanted to do something nicer this time. The Caribbean is arranged as several clusters of hotel buildings spaced around a central lake, each with a different island name (Aruba, Martinique, etc. ), with a shuttle bus running between them, or you can walk. The central area with restaurant, bar, and main pool is in Centertown. We were in Trinidad South, which is distant from the rest of the resort and does not have a feel of being part of the resort (can't see Centertown). I felt like we really missed out on the resort experience, being placed here. It felt like being in a quiet, somewhat remote apartment complex looking out on a parking lot. It was a bit far to walk with children back to Centertown, had to take the bus each time. The room was small, nice but minimalist--in this price range, you would expect luxurious accommodations from major chains like Hilton or Marriott, but what we got was pretty identical to the Allstar rooms. Grounds were tidy but low effort and not pretty, nothing in bloom despite being in Florida in March. If I did this trip again, I would either stay somewhere nicer off site (did this the first 2 nights of our trip and it was preferable, even having to drive in to parks), or stay in one of the budget hotels. Staff as always were delightful. I was a little worried at first about all the reviews about  construction but not once did it interfere with our stay, dining experiences or anything for that matter. The construction is mostly being done on one certain area. Our room was clean, our beds were comfortable and our building was between two bus stops. It was easy to get to and from the parks and each island has a room set up with food, drinks and snacks. I would definitely stay again. Upon opening the door there was an obvious odor of mold, which we are both allergic to, so it made the stay uncomfortable from the get-go. I should have requested another room. But with carpeting on the floor, and lots of time spent in the pool with most guests, the carpets surely are repeatedly getting wet. Unfortunately there was a noise, sounded like a dripping out of the AC vent, in the bathroom that was non-stop the entire time we were there, hard to sleep with that. The room was recently remodeled but very dark The service was great, but there was a yard long hair in the tub and dust accumulated around the bathroom exhaust. This hotel was a disappointment. I have stayed at many different Disney properties, and this was my least favorite. The property is too big and spread out. Taking the bus is a huge hassle. Going to the main pool by the jitney is a main hassle. We were not greeted in a friendly way, like we have come to expect in Disney. Will not stay here again. Lovely hotel with comfortable rooms. We unfortunately didn’t have tome to use any of the facilities. The staff was particularly helpful, especially the bell staff who has great recommendations for shortcuts in getting around the parks and hotels. Loved that it was right by a shuttle bus pick up/drop off. We stayed in Trinidad North and it was great- no construction. Shuttle service was great too. The main pool was nice as well. The only negative was dining in a big food tent for $100 It was an ok hotel, but I believed overpriced for what is was. The rooms are very far from facilities and you must walk ALOT to get anywhere. The hotel was under renovation so it's kind of difficult to know how big an impact that had. Overall, I was please with the room, cleanliness, and staff. Most of the restaurants were shut done for the reno so that was limiting. Room was clean & beds were comfortable. Refrigerator is too small to even fit normal bottled waters standing upright. No microwave. When refrigerator did not work correctly, a worker came to check it. He claimed it was working (cool inside but not cold). He suggested I get some ice for my cooler & that the fridge could not accommodate many items...not a good solution. The pools were nice. Beach areas were neat & clean... No other complaints. We checked in at 2:45 am and waited almost 15minutes for an employee to begin the process. Registration took 20minutes which is ridiculous and unwelcome when you are exhausted. Service was so slow. The property is under construction so we were awakened by trucks. The room rate was very high for a very average room, but at least the room was clean. Everyone we encountered was kind and helpful. Although there was construction the resort was still beautiful and well kept. Do to construction were unable to get food after coming back after a long day at parks. Fun stay ! Would do it again! Room nice and transportation to parks worked out! Under construction.Under achieving.Under whelming. Beautiful hotel, rooms were clean an comfortable. I loved the pool and the cayman cay. The resort is under construction, as we had been warned before our stay. However, the condition of the one dining tent was a lot less appealing than I could have imagined. I'm a huge fan of Disney and their properties, and I understand the renovations taking place... I would just have expected Disney to put a little more effort into the common spaces (i.e. dining hall and shopping areas) during renovations. Service was up to Disney standard, all of the employees were great. Our room was clean and comfortable as well. Resort was nice. Room was adorable. Check in and out was a complete nightmare. After losing my voice from so much fun at Disney the night before, I had to explain an issue to our checkout lady that the check in lady made a mistake of. And after explaining It literally 4 times she still didn’t understand. And refused to get me a manager to explain to them. Never have I been treated with such disrespect at a hotel let alone a Disney one. I refuse to come back to this hotel because the staff at the reception area. This is an old resort. It was very clean and well maintained. However, the reason I’ll never stay there again is bc you can’t just walk to lobby. You have to walk to a pavilion and wait on a bus. There are no stores, gift shops or snacks for purchase. If you stay here you better have a car. Bc you’re out of luck if you’re hungry, forgot a toothbrush or need some ibprophen. You also have to bus to the restaurants on site unless you get lucky and stay right next to them. It was very inconvenient and a huge pain. So take lots of snacks and drinks to keep in your room. It was too bad that they were in the process of doing a major renovation. The poor way that the dining and bar were set up could have been planned out way better, especially for a Disney Resort. I have no doubt that the finished project probably be very nice. Also the room cleaning should be improved, there were many long dark colored hairs throughout our room. Thank goodness that we only stayed 2 nights. On the good side, all of the staff members were very pleasant and upbeat as well as being very certious. Really nice place. Is undergoing extensive renovations of some common areas. Only there for 2 days so didn't explore the whole complex. It's under construction but aside from cranes and beams you don't really notice it. Nice and close to the parks. Long check in but that was my fault. We had a great time here Great resort...some construction around the area but never heard any of it. There was a lot of construction and the food was not good at all. This is my least favorite of the 9 Disney resorts I have stayed at thurs far. The room was very spacious. Bathroom had nice sized vanity area with 2 sinks but small, very tight area for tub/shower and toilet area. The decor was in good shape the it looked dated. There is plenty of constuction in this resort area so it was hard it get around the resort so we just stayed in the room. Property under construction. Amenities non-existent I literally slept in an ashtray for 3 nights at this hotel. I'm both pregnant and a non-smoker and had requested a non-smoking room. The room that they put me in was infiltrated with smoke. The beds, carpet, shower curtain; it was everywhere. I woke up feeling ill everyday due to the horrible air quality. I know that it will take weeks and several washings to get the horrible smell out of my clothes and personal belongings. What a HORRIBLE experience. hotel was nice, but didn't get much in formation about our tickets we purchasted or about our bus to different locations. a lot of buses  only take 1 handicap  person, we spent a lot of time waiting on buses Nice room setting, comfy soft bed,nice pool areas and sand beach with hammocks where people can hang out.Food court has variety of foods, good for breakfast. There's a souvenirs shop where you can buy your Disney souvenirs in case you didn't have a chance to buy them at the park. Very pleased with the Caribeann Beach Hotel. We were there for five relaxing nights.enjoyed ourselves very much. Disney did not disappoint. We loved our pirate themed room. Part of the resort is under construction, but that did not affect our stay. Found a surprise food truck near our area one morning, for coffee and muffins. Saved a little time since we were a walk from the main food area. We didn’t do much at the resort, constructions didn’t bother us at all because we were at the theme park. My kids went to play in the kiddie pool area near the big pool and they love it. A lot of activities for the kids to do. Food was ok but not much on the menu. Transportations service is very good. Never have to wait long. Hotel room was ok, resort is big and very pretty. I love the staffs there, very friendly and helpful. I travel to Orlando for work a lot & this time, decided to splurge & book a Disney Resort. The Caribbean Beach Resort was affordable & I was eager to experience a little Disney magic during my downtime. The Resort is actually much larger than I expected, so my colleagues & I needed to drive or ride the internal shuttle bus to get together. The shuttle is super convenient, though, stopping every 15 minutes or so, so it worked out. The Resort does look a bit dated, with pastel colored buildings & funny 1980s leaded glass lighting. It was a bit like staying in a condo or townhouse. The rooms have big windows, but they all open onto the walkways of the buildings, so if you opened your curtains, everyone passing by would see you. I know the Resort is under reconstruction right now. I hope they will find a way to make the windows more private. Adding balconies to some rooms would be nice, too. Again, because every room opens onto the walkways, there's room for sitting outside, but you'd be sitting out in the open, where people are passing by. We were especially appreciative of the free shuttle to Disney parks &  Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney & Pleasure Island). We went to Disney Springs for dinner & shopping twice & it was really easy & convenient. We splurged for one night and made a reservation in a pirate room. You should have seem the size of our kids' eyes when we opened the door! Every detail was thought of in true Disney form - the dresser was disguised as old stacked crates, the beds were pirate ships, the curtain rod was a sword, and on and on. My son studied the different pirates ships printed on the shower curtain for quite some time. The main building was made to look like an outdoor market (but you're still inside). The main pool area had water slides themed inside of old pirate fort. The life guards were extremely attentive, yet always pleasant. We rented a surry bike for our family and biked around the whole resort on a beautiful paved path (used for running as well). We weren't here long, but it was definitely worth the splurge! My family and I stayed at Martinique July '17. We knew going in there would be construction, but I felt like the description of the impact didn't reflect reality. The property itself was run down. Shabby rooms, shabby decor, shabby exterior, shabby grounds (if Disney is trying to emulate the third world aspects of the Caribbean, they nailed it). It also kind of felt like the staff was on Island time - 45 minutes to check in is just not reasonable. There was only one proper restaurant open on the entire property and it was absolutely terrible in terms of food quality. The pool was decent (though the amount of chlorine in the was unbelievable) but we only got to enjoy it a few hours as the power went out. In July. When it 95 degrees and incredibly humid. For four hours. In the entire resort (including or no longer air conditioned room). Disney's budget properties were well above this resort. Really disappointing. It was not online but this hotel is going through a major renovation. The breakfast restaurant was s tent. The buffet was not expensive but the cooked food was all poor quality. There was fresh fruit, bread rolls and coffee. The grounds need better maintenance. The landscape maintenance is subpar for a Disney Resort. It took 30 minutes to register for our room. There was no wait as we were a late check in. Our room was clean and comfortable. The layout was thoughtout. The coffee maker had not been cleaned in days. The coffee pods were stuck to their frame wihin the design of the coffee maker. When I called for a  replacement I was told a replacement pot would take 45 minutes to get to the room. I settled for having the coffee maker replaced the next morning. This took three visits as house keeping showed up without coffee. Before leaving for a second trip I also asked house keeping for tea as the night before I was told tea would be included. The delivery person said no tea was available. Ok, I asked for decaf. He showed up with only regular coffee, therefore a third trip to my room to deliver decaf. All the Disney staff involved in transportation and merchandise were as friendly and helpful as Walt would have expected. The luggage handlers were also helpful and cheery. That being said 3 Stars is being very generous. The hotel staff did not tell us much about the food which there was none except for a food truck and dining room tend the food was not good the stuff was not helpful they didn’t let us know that we couldn’t walk around from the customhouse to our hotel rooms the shuttle was not reliable at one point we waited 45 minutes for an internal shuttle to come and get us the squirrels and birds are extremely aggressive and actually fluid my grandson and knocked him down the pool was great The lifeguards were great it seems that the staff really didn’t know much about what was going on there because they were not very helpful hotel is very nice and very clean had good food and nice pool Nice clean hotel with friendly staff, great pools and good food. short walk to catch the bus to different areas of disneyworld. buses run every 20 minutes so not much wait time. Our daughter and granddaughters were staying at the Caribbean Beach hotel. On our reservation (made weeks in advance ) we requested to stay in the same building. My daughter confirmed our request when she checked in and was assured our request would be honored. When we arrived we were told that there was no availability in that building and we were placed in a building at the total other side of the resort. It ruined our whole vacation. Clean room but for the price I would expect more of an update. The pool was very nice, the rooms were decent size with a lot of counter space ( I pack a lot, including a blender for my morning smoothies). I gave the facilities a 4 because they were under construction and the food court and gift shops were closed at this time. I will stay again! A bunch of places are being refurbished, including the main restaurant area and gift shop. Room Service had a 75 min wait for a pizza delivery. We had to ask them to change the sheets two nights in a row since we found stains on them. Still, the hotel is nice. I'm guessing that it's really beautiful when half of it isn't being blocked up for reconstruction. The rooms have a bit more space than the ones on value resorts. Even though under construction, staff did everything needed to make accommodations work. The bus service within the resort and within the park was great. Our grandson loved the pool! It was a disappointing site to see most of the facility under construction . Facilities for dining and concierge access were too far and inconvenient . Not enough amnesties for guest. Hotel did not even offer some sort of compensation for the current construction that made the hotel facilities very inconvenient. Not enough activities for guests. Too many inconvenience to list. The air conditioning/ heater is very noisy could not sleep. Hotel try to fix it last day stay. We recently stayed 2 night at the Caribbean Beach Resort and found the room musty which made it difficult as I have breathing issues. Additionally this is a really large resort with most facilities in one spot so if you are in a room at the end or the resort you need to either walk a far distance or take the internal shuttle. Would not recommend staying here unless you had a car. Layout of hotel is just too wipespead. Long walk from parking lot to room. Our room had clothes left in the drawer from the prior guests and trash cans with no trash bags. Not what we expected for a Disney hotel. Under construction food court is in a tent, building a whole new resort around the existing, We had a great stay. The only drawback was the construction on site. But all in all it was a great stay and we would return. Nicely appointed rooms, staff was excellent! Rooms looked updated with the exception of the mattresses. Worst bed I've ever slept in-- mattresses were slumped in the middle, absolutely horrible.
WiFi is fairly stable even though we have to request for daily passwords. Generous space Great location Great in-room facilities Good location. A/C in master bathroom was leaking. Also a bad smell was coming from the kitchen sink area. Service was good and location is convenient. Security good. Good greeting. But internet very bad. Slow speed Apartment is just behind Hotel Park Royal. Very clean, very quiet, near MRT & Malls. Has washing machine, kitchenette, bathtub and shower. Highly recommend for families with young children. Great apartment in the middle of the shopping area. It had a full kitchen, lounge and separate bedroom with ensuite. Security guards very vigilant and controlled access into the building. Very nice hotel, I went to this hotel for 5 days with family, it was like a second house ,very comfortable with all the facilities, you don't have to bring in any thing, breakfast was very good and the staff in the kitchen was very cooperative,front desk staff was also very helpful and understanding  ( specially Ms Sue),I have a great time with my family in Bintang fairlane Residences KL, I will give 5 stars, only one thing I should say that Hotel should have a back up electricity system which was lacking  because power failure happen for 2 hrs one day and ther was not any light in whole of the area ,I was expecting that hotel should have its own generator system which should back up electricity power for at least few hrs. Found this apartment style accomodation in the heart of Bukit Bintang, great location. We chose it after staying at another hotel nearby after returning from Langkawi. The gentleman manager who greeted us was so very helpful throughout our stay making us feel welcome. The size of the accomodation was amazing, two bedroom two bathrooms, huge lounge and kitchen. This was cheaper than the 4 star place we stayed at plus that was tiny for two adults and a teenager. Breakfast was adequate but not as much variety as elsewhere. Awesome roof top pool and gym as well. Being an apartment that the premises manages for owners and is let to tourists etc, it was not as clean as a hotel room, with dust etc accumulating under all furniture. Overall would stay again purely for the location, size, and cost factor. We booked a one bedroom superior suite only two days before arrival. A bit excited coz we've always wanted to have a quick weekend getaway but with good room amenities (kitchen, washer, etc) and spacious enough for our little girl to enjoy herself. But... when checking in the receptionist informed that the aircond in our room has broken down and we were transferred to another hotel with the promise that we will have the same type, an apartment suite. Upset but still positive, we went through the hellish jam all the way to the Federal Hotel only to find that the parking is part of Low Yat Plaza and around the time the parking is difficult. And old architecture with bizarre parking layouts.. Double upset when looking at our little girl fallen asleep in the car. When we checked in Federal, the receptionist inform that she gave us a free upgrade from deluxe to superior. A bit happy but once entering the room we found that it's only a normal room, not an apartment as promised by Bintang's receptionist. When I called Bintang they just mentioned yes it's a normal room. Not apartment. Maybe the other receptionist got it wrong without even having any slight guilt. Can't believe we book only 2 days in advance and suddenly the aircond is malfunctioning? The staff should've inform us much earlier. Very very upset. Will never book here again! The hotel management needs to put some attention on the hygene part. The rooms are extremely dirty and bathrooms filthy and smelly. 100 year old furniture which seems will break if you touch it and half the things do not work. There is no reception lobby, just a small dirty office where they do all your paper work and no one will bother about your luggage so pls do not leave it on the road. No shower/bathroom extras will be given so pls have your shampoo, showergel, toothbrush and toothpaste with you. They lie when they post pictures in Expedia and other online pages, the reality is far from what they show you. I would honestly urge you all not to book this hotel at any circumstances. Conveniently located apartment in the heart of KL, spacious & fully equipped. Yes, it's a bit lived in, yes, the shower/bath is a complete engineering fail leading to floods every time you shower, yes, there are a few stains & holes & the air-con units seem to have been installed by an ogre, but for us it was perfect, plenty of space, big fridge, washer/dryer, cable TV, wifi, air-con from heaven & pool on the rooftop.The Sungei Wang SC is just across the road & public transport a stones throw away. Check-in was a bit tedious & the girl couldn't even tell us where the nearest ATM was (just around the corner) or a supermarket (across the road in SW SC) was. Luckily, one of the security guards was a good source of such info. The best thing to say about breakfast is that the coffee was good & we got eggs made to order. Checkout was a simple & painless affair & the guy in the office was more than helpful. Overall a very safe hotel. Security is tip top.location is perfect. LRT and eatery and shopping everything is there in bukit bintang. Bathroom smelly due to flooding from shower. No hot water. Toiletries toilet paper not replenished. Towels discoloured. Could be great but is dilapidated. Advantage is It's in heart of the city. Budget facility. Clean and neat. Big space of the room worth the price. But only thing is the terrible smelly from the bathroom/toilet, dusty everywhere from the mattress, floor, to the balcony outside. The staff was really nice and the hotel gives the luxury feeling at first. But then the safe in the room wasn't working and there were ants walking around and some walls had broken parts and the room looked dirty. Rooms were dirty and had roaches and lizards in the room 1. Check in time not 7 AM, they ask me to wait until 2pm or pay for extra. but i did't pay extra & check in around 10am after having argument with staff.
Friendly and accommodating staff and a clean and pleasant environment. For the price paid this was a tired old hovel, very tatty, corridors tatty , bathroom tatty A night's stay splitting up a long drive. The car park has plenty of spaces by the hotel, easy enough to find if you watch out for the signs. The hotel staff were very efficient signing us in at 10:30pm, only took about 5 minutes which was ideal with a tired 5 year old waiting for his bed. The room itself is what you would expect for a roadside hotel, clean and functional. Ours had a double and single bed. The room was toasty hot which was nice after the freezing outdoors. Tea and coffee facilities consisted of a kettle two mugs and a small range of tea bags, dry coffee normal and decaf. Plus a pack of biscuits a small feature often missed out by these types of hotels. Who doesn't like a nice biccy with their tea? Recommended to all to stay here. The whole atmosphere from booking in to leaving the hotel is very good. Staff were very friendly and helpful Staff nice. Bed unbelievably crap. Slept on top of bed cus didn’t look very nice under covers. Carpet was dirty Room was fine if a bit tired decor. Unfortunately the mattress was not great. Could feel the springs and dipped either side of the centre. Otherwise fine foe the price. At 1st sight room looked great. Very spacious, but on a closer look room was dirty, cobwebs, juice sprayed up walls & soap scum on shore head & rail. Hotel was full so stayed the night in our very comfy & cosey beds & reported all to reception staff in the morning   They were very apologetic. The staff members were friendly. The Days Inn is very tired and in need of a refurbishment and a deep clean. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel it was basic but was Comfortable and clean and had everything we needed.xx Just what we needed after a long drive. Clean. Friendly. Perfect. Arrived frozen to a lovely welcome and then a comfy hot room great place for an overnight stay if you are travelling, been made so welcome I would definitely recommend it Hotel is well located just off the motorway one mile north of  Gretna. Hotel looks a bit tired and there  is no restaurant or bar. There is KFC , Burger King etc close . Reception was particularly warm. Room was fine and temperature was warm too, on a freezing night outside. overall good but needs upgrading  abit but comfortable We like staying at the Days Inn Gretna because of the helpful friendly staff. Always an enjoyable stay. We appreciated the New Showers This is the perfect hotel to stay in if you want to have a break while traveling, the rooms are warm and staff make you so welcome highly recommend it Ok cheap last minute stay, staff  friendly helpful presentable room was adequate clean coffee and tea facility's good no biscuits bed was comfy bedding was clean and stainless. Good,room big enough to accommodate an arm chair or small settee for viewing tv at night,but overall good value The room was clean and functional but only had 2 mugs and no tea bags, we had to ask at desk for them. We had booked a family room for three but towels only provided for two people. Really friendly staff and welcome. Only stayed 1 night on the way to Scotland. Rooms were spacious, bed a little uncomfortable and bathroom basic. We didn't eat at the hotel. We would stay there again for the night. On the motorway at gretna,  very convenient, the hotel is clean and the staff are very helpful and friendly. A great budget stop on the road to Scotland . Price - 10/10 Staff - 10/10 Room (29) - 10/10 Cleanliness - 10/10 Facilities - 08/10 - could only find one plug socket. Bed Comfort/Size - 10/10 Noise - 10/10 - extremely quiet. Would we recommend? YES!! Should be on the list of everyone who's staying for a wedding in Gretna or for tourism in the area. We had a good night's sleep. Only fault was the bath water want that hot apart from that we had a good stay for a family of 4 Room was basic, beds are horrendous to sleep On, though very clean generally the bath had a large rust stain on it from a leaky tap.. I say bath, what I mean is large sink! I'm a 6ft2 bloke and it wasn't deep enough to even sit in and cover my legs .. tv is tiny, get a brew kit with nice biscuits..   On arrival I got my room key and turns out that room hadn't been cleaned when we walked into it but was quickly offered another room by the very apologetic polite receptionist, room 2 smelt very bad of curry though. Overall it's just a place to get your head down for a few hours if you can manage to get comfy on the bed that's so springy every time you move it carries on rippling for a no it's or two giving you borderline sea sickness... then your gonna be sweet as in this place. Very basic hotel. The first room we were assigned had not been cleaned at all. The front desk quickly reassigned us another room but clearly they thought the first room had been cleaned. The other room had had only a basic clean. Both beds had hairs in them and the area behind the bathroom door had perhaps never been cleaned. Lace curtains were not properly attached, and the heating control was effectively the on/off switch. Also very few electrical outlets in the room. An overall lack of amenities is not surprising at this price point, but the lack of cleanliness is not acceptable. Funny damp smell and room not serviced during 3 day stay, had to get reception to give us fresh towels and even travelodge make your beds. Cups not cleaned/changed throughout stay and tea and coffee not replenished and only one spoon between three people. Bed was interesting it wobbled all over the place and felt like a waterbed. Staff were what we expected just the right side of polite to not complain. The hotel was easy to find, car parl was free and the stay was cheap. Didnt try the breakfast cause it looked way too expensive for what you got, we travelled 5 minutes down the road to the gretna gateway outlet centre and had a fantastic breakfast in their restaurant. Good stopover for trip home always great place too stay Very comfortable overnight stopover - but shame on the site operator who fails so lamentably to provide a reasonably lit and marked roadway for the first time nighttime visitor. Almost a Health and Safety matter - I had no idea where I was going, whether it was a one way roadway, etc etc. Nothing to rave about but it was clean and a good place to put our heads down for the night. Free Yorkshire Tea in the room was a massive bonus! Reception personnel were friendly and helpful. Friendly staff, warm clean room, bed a bit soft and lumpy, excellent shower. Great stay, but could do with better quality mattress. The hotel was clean and with friendly staff. Comfortable sleep so everything needed for an overnight stay A reasonable hotel, you get what you pay for. Cheap, quiet, relatively clean if you get the right room. It is on a service station. Friendly and helpful staff. Lovely comfortable bed. Great place to stop on long trips and easy access to Gretna Gateway shopping village. Restaurants nearby but nice and quiet. For the price paid this was a tired old hovel, very tatty, corridors tatty , bathroom tatty Stayed in this hotel with my husband and toddler. The room was immaculate could not fault it. The travel cot was already assbled with a cute little children's blanket. The room was warm and comfortable would definitely recommend to all. Staff were friends and approachable. Friendly and accommodating staff and a clean and pleasant environment. Good value basic room. Clean and comfortable. Staff helpful. Very convenient  stopover.
The lobby personnel are wonderful. This hotel had inconsistent quality. We started with a lovely room that smelled bad. Actually, the smell came from the hallway on the first floor. We moved to another floor. That room wasn't half as nice, same price, no smell but the bathroom was dirty. I showed them pictures of the dirty places so they moved us to a third room! The front desk person indicated they were short-staffed because of a holiday weekend. We find it hard to relax if we must move and move. That's why we book multiple nights in the same places. They'd sell a lot more breakfasts if they'd reduce the price, even if they have fewer foods offered. This was a pleasure trip so super-expensive breakfasts were not in the budget! We saw very few others at breakfast so it appears lots of other people agree with us. An in-room coffee & tea maker is always appreciated. We thought our 2nd room didn't have it but we found it, too late, in a VERY odd spot as we packed to move out! Was there to see old friends....was a little way from downtown and Old city, but staff showed me a bus available most of day from across the street. Staff was outstanding, very helpful--all of them from the front desk to the maids. Noted that most the managers were involved with their staff, cleaning constantly, and straightening areas constantly. Would definately stay there again. Breakfast was very good too, and they made me a box breakfast for an early airport departure. A nicer than nice staff. My single biggest problem with the Dan Boutique is the artificial fragrance that wafts throgh the lobby through the ac vents. So bad I got a migraine from the scent and had to take medication. Breakfast was unoriginal and never varied. Check in time is from 14:00. We had to wait almost an hour till the room was ready. Our preferred choice of hotel in Jerusalem. A very good choice in Jerusalem. Got a view room overlooking the old city!! Great stay. This hotel was good for it's purpose,  however wouldn't say exceptional. It could have been cleaner, overall. Bathrooms are outdated and carpet needs to be replaced. Hotel says free parking and lists parking as an amenity. Then in small print later on they add the word limited parking available. If you want to trust that the amenities listed are actually available at the hotel you book- stay clear from this fraudulent establishment clearly trying to trick people into services they do not provide. And their assurances to me that I was not the only one fooled and unable to park at the hotel did little to make me happier with the situation. Staff with power extremely rude and obstinate. They actually have the audacity to try and convince the guests we shouldn't expect the amenities they list online! Ones without power use the I only work here, I have no control excuse. My husband and I went to Israel to celebrate our 25th Anniversary, with family and friends that live there. We paid 300.00$ a day and was sent to a dark dingy room, with a baby play pen, pictures above this play pen that would only be appealing to a baby/child. Our view of the parking lot and garbage bin was directly below us. You can imagine my shock as I told Expedia we are two adults!! They moved us after I refused to have the crib/playpen removed. The decor in that area had pictures that would only be appropriate for a child. The second room had a view. However, it desperately needed new carpet and it felt dirty. The third move we were given the only balcony in the hotel from what I could see. We accepted this gratefully, thanks to a wonderful young woman who’s name I unfortunately have forgotten. Her lovely accent was that from Russia or the Ukraine. Her patience and concern of how disappointed I was mattered to her. My husband and I have always enjoyed staying in Dan hotels. The location of this hotel is fantastic. The rooms need to be redecorated. It should be noted that a couple should not be put in a room that would only be appropriate for a family with a small child. Hoping this information will provide insight in assisting future guests. We were upgraded to room on the second floor over the street. Shouldn't an upgrade have gotten us a room with a view of the Old City. The bed was two twin beds pushed together with two separate sheets. Room carpeting needed to be cleaned. It smelled pretty dank. Room needed a paint job. Wifi never worked well and sometimes not at all. Shower was good Good value and nice position adjacent to the Hatachanah Harishon. Rooms small but otherwise nice. Rather basic breakfast by Israeli standards Modern quirky hotel in convenient location. Good sized rooms. Good selection of buffet breakfast & evening meal. Staff very friendly, especially Ishmael in the bar. Lovely views from the roof terrace. Would definately recommend & return. Thank you all! Excellent staff and location. Modern hotel, free computer in lobby. 24 market within a two min walk. old railroad station converted to outside mall with restaurants and bars just across the street. old city around 20 min walk north of hotel. We chose this hotel based on it's proximity to the Old City and the ability to walk back and forth without having to rent a car. The terrace offered a beautiful outdoor patio that had tremendous views of the city. The hotel staff was friendly, courteous and helpful in providing directions and food recommendations. Enjoyed chatting with Islam who helped me with my dining experience. Love the chef who went out of his way to make me feel welcome! 5-10 mins walk to Jaffa Gate! Excellent location! I would never come back. Bad communication with guests. Not good value. Breakfast was terrible. Service was worse. It was exactly what I was looking for; it was clean, comfortable, the food was good, and the staff were excellent. Great location , staff very friendly and helpful , on site car park for hire car The hotel is located in a great location in Jerusalem, and some of the rooms have a fantastic view towards the old city (I was lucky to be in one of those). The service is excellent throughout the hotel: from the security people who will guide you to parking, to the bar hotel in the evening. The breakfast is outstanding and the food is excellent. The room is dark enough to provide a good sleep. Good WiFi connection too Lovely hotel , large room, large balcony , amazing Position Clean nice in a great location. Great stuff  Good breakfast Wonderful hotel. Very welcoming and helpful service. Helped us with great recommendations for restaurants. Good location, 15 minute walk to Jaffa Gate, though you have to deal with hill. Staff able to speak English too. No complaints! The hotel is quite good and staff are very nice. It is at an amazing location where you can actually  walk to the town   - 20 min. The weather was so good. Mind you, it's Israeli b'fast but still quite good. We were there for Passover week and we had a wonderful time. Also, we could attend the church service on Easter Sunday at Christ church which was only 10 minutes by taxi. I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Always stay at this hotel when in Jerusalem as it meets all my needs nice hotel...however, it was an uphill walk to the Kotel which was not easy. So a taxi was necessary. Overall the hotel was lovely. No pool which would have been nice. Great front desk staff and bell staff (especially Nael). Enjoyed my stay at the hotel. While the Dan chain likes to think of itself as a 4 - 5 start chain, the Dan Boutique is mediocre (3 star) at best. From the very start to the very ed. We arrived on a Thursday afternoon and advised that as the paring lot at the front of the hotel was full (only 4 spaces) to park around the back of the hotel and bring our bags in through the back entrance. OK, sounds good, but not stated was the about 20 step stairs that needed to be negotiated unaided with three 20Kg suitcases. The room itself, allegedly superior had air-conditioning that seemed to have only two modes to work - ON (which was noisy) and OFF which created a stifling room. There was a work-desk in the room, but positioned in a dim part of the room, and when requesting some type of lamp to make business work possible, was told no such lamp is available. When we asked for a better room was advised by the front desk that the hotel was full and room changes were impossible - a patent lie as the room maid later advised that the hotel had about 25 occupancy. Went to breakfast at 8:30am Friday and halfway through my meal was advised by staff that I needed to move to another table so that they could set up for lunch. Come on!!! Would I go back - heck no. We had a lovely stay in the Dan Boutique Hotel. The decor, though not entirely current everywhere was ALMOST current everywhere. (It looked like it had been renevated around ten years ago.) There were a lot of nice design details and both the private rooms and the common areas were pleasant to be in and furnished/designed nicely. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, and versatile enough to accommodate our family for various situations (sleeping, hanging out and playing, picnicing, etc.) The cold drinks available continuously in the lobby were a nice touch. The air conditioning in the room was definitely strong enough despite the intense heat outdoors. Overall we had a lovely stay and would go back in a heartbeat. Now for the weird things. 1 - The hallway smelled funky. It was kind of like sniffing an airplane. 2 - The bathrooms were not vented to the temperature control, so while our room was a very comfortable temperature, the bathroom was essentially a free sauna. There was a window in there that let in a cool breeze in the evening. We may have been able to include it in the AC had we been willing to leave the door open but we didn't try because of our toddlers. 3 - Not a big deal but it would have been nice if there was a hot water urn available over the Sabbath. There was hot water available but there was a question (for me) as to whether it was previously/continuously heated. Not relevant unless you are Sabbath-observant. A my arrival i ask for a room with a View out to the old city one of the reason to choice the hotel but was told it is only upgraded rooms . It was not mention during my reservation :(. i got a room with a view out to a parking lot. After some complained and one hour waiting the room was changed to a room with a view to the new Jerusalem. The hotel is nice have a small restaurant and nice sitting area the room is clean and nice  . a small problem is that there are many stairs to go up and down to get to the room , can be difficult with luggage. The hotel is clean, staff are helpful. Walking distance to the Old City and German Colony. Great views from the sun deck. The room is a bit small with small windows. So if you want floor to ceiling views from a spacious, open room, this might not be the place for you. We were very happy here and would definitely return. Great Hotel, the location is excellent. The staff especially the restaurant staff was excellent. There are no emenities other than a very small gym and a Sun deck with a breathtaking view. I stayed in a room with 2 kids and The room was very small not enough room to even open 2 suitcases at the same time. Friendly staff,good breakfast, convient location. . Nice location, walking distance to Jaffa Gate and block from first station, old train with diverse eating options. Awesome city views from rooftop deck. Very expansive breakfast buffet with many options. Front desk very helpful arranging airport transportation. Some rooms like mine came with great view of historic Jerusalem. Highly recommended to anybody visiting Jerusalem. Even bathrooms come with great views! Great location. Staff were pleasant and accommodating. Would recommend to friends. We have stayed at this hotel many times and it is our hotel of choice in Jerusalem. Staff attentiveness and friendliness is outstanding. Absolutely first class.
Nice hôtel, good employees, good food. (very tiny parking though, take a good driver!) Excellent transport connections. lovely food. Pleasant folk music in dining room 3 evenings. Very helpful concierge. Lovely holiday. opping Also, very noisy, sound isolation is poor. There is no elevator to the 4th floor. The room they gave me is right under the roof, it is hot. I \\f you forget to order the breakfast, you can get it at the hotel, but it costs 10 euros Nice and clean hotel with Friendly staff. Good parking spaces outside of hotel. Late check in so didn't see the area but decent hotel for a stop over. please go to another hotel Overall average. Would have got more if coffee mug in room + milk etx. Yes small thing but big. Also WiFi was extremely unreliable. Kept having to get it reset downstairs. So if you are in a position to improve both the above you would score much more. Much appreciated Very good location, bus stops every corner! Local market well worth a visit. The hotel staffs are helpful but the room is dirty and it smells. It is very noisy as well from the sound of the cars and public transportation outside to the guest in the hallway. I general, not a place to rest. There are also ants and insects on the floor the faucet was leaking. I spent two sleepless nights in this hotel.
This is the prefect hotel for a long layover, we booked it because we needed to be next to the airport and because we have three kids and saw the outdoor adventure area and thought that would be perfect for them to wear themselves out before the next flight. My only complaint is that the outdoor adventure area wasn’t even open yet abd has been advertised as part of the hotel for months now. They told me it was scheduled to open the week after we stayed there. Next time I’d recommend not to advertise something you don’t have available yet unless it says “coming soon.” The staff was helpful in finding us a little playground nearby. Practical and comfortable for an overnight stay, this hotel is 10 min. away by [free] shuttle bus from the airport. Frequent shuttle schedule, courteous & reliable driver/ staff. Clean suite and well appointed room with desk, multiple el. outlets [for re-chargers] mini bar and mini safe. Well conceived facilities/ bathroom. Excellent value. Stayed for one night and couldn’t be happier with the value. Small, cozy and very clean. The TV had 135 channels! The bed was soft and comfy. Check-in staff was friendly and gave me all the info I needed. The shuttle to the airport is very convenient and on time! Overall, very satisfied! As an overnight hotel it's great. There's a free shuttle between the hotel & airport that makes the 10min drive good. We were a family of 4 (2 teenagers 14yrs & 16yrs) & room was comfortable. Free coffee, tea & fruit in the lobby & Reception staff are only too pleased to assist you. Good hotel. Clean and quiet. Not far from downtown shopping centre. I recommend you take the train. Cab can be pricey. Nice hotel close to airport and train back to Zurich. Last minute stay, reasonably priced and the hotel staff were very nice. Let us checkin early to our room after a long flight :) It was my first stay in hotel. It was nice stay in welcome Inn. Hotel is clean with great in-room facilities. Hotel offers free hot coffee, airport transfers and the staff were very friendly. Great hotel close to the airport and SBahn. Check in was quick and a friendly experience. The hotel staff are very friendly. The hotel is very conveniently located almost within site of Kloten railway station stop, which is about 5 stops from Zurich's main train station on S7 train. Free shuttle to airport in the morning was very convenient and only 10 minute ride. Hotel is a bit dated but very clean. If you are looking for a comfortable and clean place to stay while in Zurich, this hotel offers excellent value. Very clean and comfortable. Shuttle from airport is great and check in is quick and easy. Highly recommend Hotel 10 minutes away from Zurich Airport by shuttle. Spacious rooms, delicious breakfast, friendly staff, and a very nice restaurant attached to the property! We chose this hotel as an overnight stay when coming into Switzerland. It is convenient, has free shuttle service to airport/rail station, is always clean and comfortable and the local area is catered for with cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Would recommend it to travellers who are looking for a short stay. Fast check in. Friendly and helpful staff. Airport pickup and shuttle the next morning was perfect. Perfect for an overnight stay near the airport. I didn't notice the local area, so I had to rate it as 3/5 since Hotels.com wouldn't let me give an N/A rating. Not the hotel's fault, but Hotels.com's fault! Comfortable no-frills hotel with free airport bus service. Reception staff are lovely. Breakfast is average - but good coffee! Close to the train station and woods for a jog in the morning. We stayed one night at this hotel for an early flight out the next day. They offered free shuttle service to and from the airport. Hotel was clean, roomy and comfortable. They had a mini fridge inside which was convenient. There is a restaurant on site and they offer a breakfast buffet. Staff was extremely friendly and gave us direction on how to get to the city and restaurants. They let us borrow electrical converters free of charge and offer free wifi. The staff member who checked us in was excellent. She was willing to assist us with travel advice, local activities and went the extra mile. The location was good close to the train station, supermarkets and coffee shops. The shuttle for the airport was fantastic value. The hotel is 5 minutes by car from the airport. There is a nice backerie and several snack type restaurants in walking distance. The parking is underground. The mistake we made is not dropping your luggage off at the entrance. You have to wheel your bags up an incline several hundred feet from the underground parking to the entrance. The hotel staff all spoke good english and readily answered questions. There is a hotel computer in the lobby so you can check email and print boarding passes. There is free coffee and apples,. The breakfast was 18 SF so we did not eat the breakfast. The room was clean. We were in Room 104 which faces the front. There was too much light coming in at night. At 3:00 A. M. we smelled smoke from the bathroom. Either the person in the room was smoking or we smelled smoke from the shuttle bus or delivery drivers who all seem to smoke outside of the hotel. The hotel is nonsmoking. The hotel does not have a pool. The hotel was okay for a close by place if you are going to the airport early in the morning. The price was average . The smoking smell ruined our sleep so we would probably never stay there again. We had a short stay at this hotel. We had to take a train from the Zurich train station in the early morning, and the location was convenient. The amenities were okay and the hotel staff were friendly. Everyone was so friendly !!! I forgot my plug for the outlets the house maiden let me borrow it till I left !!! The area is so cute if you walk around the town !!! I would stay again !! ! Great place-clean, quiet and loaded with nice people Great place to stay before a flight, Shuttle service to Airport; and also near a train station for access to the city. Super clean, quiet, well maintained, just a few minutes away from the airport, and really friend people from the front desk managers all the way to the airport/hotel shuttle drivers. We enjoyed our stay,close to the train station and restaurants.it would be nice if they didn’t let people smoke front of the hotel.breakfast was good and overall very good. Every 1/2 hour, the shatel conect between the hotel to Zurich airport, 5 min’ drive. Ecxelent! Great breakfast, Hot drinks and fruit are served all day in waiting area. We where very pleased
I spent 6 fantastic days at this location during The St. Patty’s Day Parade Week. Being an Irish girl SPD is a week long celebration for me! From the moment you walk in, Sandy, Ivan, Jeannie, Kansans, Abraham, June Li, Johanna, Ulza, Jamilka, Leslie, Arnold, Latina, Lis, Keyon, Jerome, Mary and Lin are graciously waiting to assist you in satisfying your requests. Sal in maintenance came to my room to quickly repair a shorted socket. I so enjoyed my morning coffee on the 7th floor overlooking the skaters in Rockefeller Center. Mauricio, Freddy, Gisell, Fernando,  Francisco and Zoumana do an excellent job in The Terrace Club by providing courteous and efficient service. Marion is always available to keep things running smoothly. Thank you all at The Club Quarters Rockefeller Center for the best St Patty’s Day, I’ve had to date! The staff was amazing. Lots of amenities that I wasn't staying long enough to enjoy (only there one evening). My decision to stay at the Club Quarters, opposite Rockfeller Center was based on location (around corner from event I attended), price (reasonable), and the great reviews. Well, I can honestly say, I would definitely stay here again and the positive reviews were well earned. If you are visiting NYC, the location is ideal for getting to the most popular sight seeing spots quickly and easily. The room was fairly small (par for the course in NYC), but clean, comfortable and well laid out. The only negative was that the noise level was a little louder than what I would have preferred, as I could hear the rather loud man in the room next to mine. I am sure that had I said something, the incredibly accommodating staff would have remedied the situation. Overall, the hotel is nice and I would definitely stay there again Having appointments at Rockefeller Center, this hotel was ideally located. Like many small hotels today, this is mostly a do-it-yourself experience. You check yourself in with a kiosk and absent some specific need, you may never actually speak with any staff during your stay. We rang for extra towels once and the person who delivered them (quickly) was our lone human contact. Rooms are of average size for NYC and while perhaps a bit worn are well appointed and comfortable. Sheets and towels are mid-grade, which is to be expected at this price point. The room seemed clean and well ordered. The thermostat was hard to modulate and the room was much too warm for us, so we chose to shut it off and open the window. Others might not have found this a good option and certainly if it had been raining, we'd have needed to find another solution. TV does not include any premium cable. Our room had a view of the ice rink and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Upon further inspection, two items in the room jumped out at me. The bathroom vent obviously had not been cleaned in -- perhaps -- years. I realize that this is not something that is cleaned with each guest, but it needs to be done in a standard rotation. This obviously isn't the case here. The photo hanging on the bathroom wall as decoration similarly hadn't been cleaned and was covered in splotches of God-knows-what. I have a great deal more to say (good & bad), but Expedia inexplicably limits this 1500 characters. Brilliant location bang in the centre of everything, a few minute walk to some of the biggest attractions. However, the hotel is very old and tired. What we were not made aware when booking through Expedia, which we are very disappointed about, was that although the booking confirmation said 'queen bed' it was actually in an extremely small room which the hotel calls a 'club' room. We were unfortunate enough to experience three rooms there as our first room was so small and the chair had stains and bedding holes, but we had to pay extra ourselves to upgrade from a 'club' room to a slightly larger room which was just standard. They would have changed our room at no cost but it would have been to another 'club' room and it just wasn't up to standard. The second room we were moved to and paid to upgrade to had a broken door onto a terrace so they said they would get it fixed. When we returned it wasn't fixed, there was a small bit of metal over the door to prevent it from flying open but it wasn't closed right so all of the freezing cold air was getting in and there was a clear security issue - I'm not sure how they deemed it was suitable for us to stay there. We asked to be moved. The next room was okay, but the heating system was broken and we had to switch it on manually under this big box. By this stage we were so sick of packing up our things and weren't confident that the next room wouldn't have even more problems so we just stayed in that room for the final few nights. This hotel is greatly located at Rockefeller Center.Great shopping and great food.Not far from Times Square or central park.Very near to many theatres and Radio City Music Hall,CBS and NBC studios.The day I checked in (Thursday),I will give the hotel a poor rating.One of two elevators was not working,my room TV and coffee maker also was not working.The next three days I give the hotel a excellent rating.The hotel restaurant is very nice and there is even a country bar in the basement  with free rides on a mechanical bull.I will be choosing this hotel again on my next trip to NYC because the location is fantastic Walking distance to Broadway show, evening dining and exhibits. At St. Patrick's Cathedral for Easter services. I chose this hotel based on location. It was a nice hotel, very comfortable. Rooms were quiet, bed comfortable, black out curtains blocked out the city lights. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. We stayed in the Club Quarters Hotel, opposite the Rockefeller Centre for 5 nights and could not fault this hotel. Location is perfect and the staff could not do enough for us. Would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel and will definitely stay again when I return to New York. Issue with charges to our room. Queried them, but as soon as we left, they charged my card regardless. Room was dirty. The temp outside wss 35+. The ac was not working. Staff wss willing to switch us to another room. chosen for it's central midtown location. Staff very friendly and helpful. The Terrace Club on the 7th floor is a discovery worth remembering, quiet atmosphere in a noisy place on the planet. Very convenient location but lots of street noise at night as construction was ongoing nesrby making it difficult to sleep. This hotel is the perfect location for sightseeing, next to rockerfella centre, 5th ave, Central Park and Times Square. The hotel was excellent, the room was perfect, a little small but that’s what you have to expect in nyc. The room had a coffee machine and unlimited bottles of water. It really was one of the best hotels I have stayed at in nyc with regards to value for money. I would definitely recommended staying here. I would stay here again. The price can’t be beat for the location. The room was small but beautifully appointed. There is a nice restaurant on the seventh floor with a great view and that also offers a nice breakfast buffet. And the check in and check out process was easy and efficient. Very comfortable, nice gym for its size. Very good room service. Walking distance to Carnegie Hall, Museum of modern art, Broadway, Central Park and good restaurants Just feet from Radio city music hall and Rockefeller Center Best hotel I've ever stayed in while in NYC. Early check-in. Close proximity to many restaurants. Subway entrances within 2 blocks. NYC was hit with a surprise snow storm 0°C - 3°C and brace this... the heater in my room was broken. Of course the hotel is fully booked that there's no other room I can move to. Apparently I was upgraded to a better room... the one that was falling apart with no heater or fan ventilation whatsoever. The toilet paper holder was broken as well dangling off the wall and hot water showers were not available at all times... if you're staying at a higher floor... good luck! No direct phone line to contact front desk at all, if you have a problem... you have to go down to the lobby and the elevator takes forever. Don't bother paying for breakfast with your hotel package, you're better off eating at a restaurant in the area. The only plus at this hotel is the convenient location and free wine happy hour... other than that it's terrible. Location was great. Food and service on the 7th floor was great. Snack offerings on 7th floor were unexpected and really good. Price was good too. However, the bed was uncomfortable with pillows and mattress were too soft. I also didn't have any wash clothes in my room, only hand towels and bath towels. Very nice. Clean and quiet. Friendly staff. Half block from radio city. Windows open  bit. Good thing to chill food drinks. LSO, a purified chilled water eith empty bottles. S plus. Great stay with the kids. Got two rooms and each included a sofa bed. Plenty of room in the suite and next to Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. The American Doll story is literally next door as well. Great stay in the city. This was the first time I’ve stayed at a hotel in NY. I was surprised that the rooms did not have a small fridge or microwave. WiFi was tricky. Though the location of the hotel was awesome. It’s basucakly in the middle of everything in Manhattan. Superb location for our Easter in New York. Wonderfully large and comfortable room. Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff, especially Sandy at the front desk. Partook of the free wine tasting - good innovation. Fast WiFi. Would certainly recommend to fellow travellers seeking a hassle free stay. The room was small and could have been cleaner. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The location is great. We were supposed to have a queen bed but it fit more like a full and the mattress was much too soft. The frosted glass bathroom door was an issue because it allowed light into the room when the bathroom was used in the middle of the night. Again small room. show, and shopping, perfect location! Great view from the restaurant Very good hotel. Located in a very good area Room is very small, some people would call it “cozy” but its very small, you can feel a little claustrophobic here. Restaurant and staff is very good and friendly. Walls are a little bit thin, we had one issue one night that the couple next door were fighting and we heard everything; Called front staff and luckily they solved the issue We were so disappointed with our stay at Club Quarters. It was hot in NYC when we stayed (90'sF). The air-conditioning was either not working, or had been turned off in all common areas. This made waiting for the lift (which often was an extended wait), riding in the lift and walking to our room very unpleasant. If this was due to broken air-conditioning, then we should have been notified. On top of that, the cleaning staff turned off our room air-conditioner whenever our room was serviced! Coming off the hot streets and entering a stuffy room is not what you expect from a hotel of this calibre. Getting ready for a night out in a room that is warm and stuffy is not pleasant. If this was a cost-cutting measure - I am appalled. I would expect that from a cheap hotel - but when you pay good prices, you expect good service. One night we returned to the hotel to see the front staff member with her head in her hands, resting on the front desk - looking bored out of her brain, tired and disinterested. I can understand if no-one is around, but if you see guests entering, it's good business to be greeted with a smile. I am not a complainer - so please don't write this off as one of those guests. I travel a lot and stay in many hotels all around the world. I have never experienced this at any other hotel in NYC for a similar priced hotel. Aside from that, location was excellent. Free refillable bottled water was excellent. Was supposed to check in on Wednesday evening and stay for 2 nights - but my flight in ended up being cancelled. I called Travelocity and they attempted to contact the Club Quarters hotel to see if they could change my reservation to only 1 night. The Club Quarters representative said it was their policy to not allow cancellations the day of the reservation - regardless of the reason, so I would be charged for the room for that evening. Up until this point, I was upset but understood them hiding behind their policy. I was able to get a flight first thing next morning, and arrived at the hotel at 8 am and attempted to check in to the room I had paid for last night. The front desk told me I could not check in right now - despite the fact I had already paid for the room. They then told me to come back and in an hour - and maybe by that time they would have their system issues resolved so I could check in. The hotel was in a good location, close to Rockefeller Plaza and fifth avenue shopping. We were disappointed with our stay for a few reasons. First, the restaurant on the seventh floor was not representative of the hotel. The hotel itself was nice, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The restaurant staff was not very friendly and the customer service was lacking. When we had breakfast the next morning, we weren't even offered coffee because the restaurant was so under-staffed that they didn't seem to even notice us. Additionally, we asked for extra pillows because we were only given two, and they said they ran out of pillows. For the price that we paid, we should have been able to get additional pillows. Our experience at the CQ Hotel was excellent. We recently stayed there to experience NYC during December. The location was perfect! We could walk everywhere,  i.e. Rockefeller Center directly across the street, theatre district, great restaurants. We didn't need to take a cab anywhere. The hotel staff was friendly and couldn't have been more accommodating. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by Sandy at check-in with a warm welcome and big  smile. Check in was 3pm and it was ready for us so we didn't have to wait to get into it. Our room was very clean and comfortable. When we asked for additional pillows, they were brought up to our room in record time. We also liked the idea of having to use our room key for the elevator (an added security measure)  We never waited long.for an elevator either. We also felt the price of the room was very affordable considering location and the time of the year. We loved our stay here and will definitely be back again. Thank you CQ for giving us such a wonderful experience. A little disappointing. I booked a one bedroom which was really a studio. Also, the room could have been more updated. Will not stay there again. This is my third time staying in this hotel, it used to be a convenient and great little place to stay because it was centrally located. Unfortunately, the hotel's rooms are now rundown. Our room was extremely dusty and the bathroom was dirty, including a run around the toilet bowl that shows they haven't disinfected it in weeks. The shower was also dirty and had mold growing in between the tiles. Great location. Across the street from Radio City music hall, Rockefeller Center, great shopping on 5th Ave, short walk to Times Square and Central Park. The room was very small, but clean and comfortable for 2 people. I'd stay again. Second time staying here and will come back. Amazing location, comfortable rooms, great friendly staff and great amenities for the price. Really happy with my stay! Will come back. just across Radio Music City Hall and Rockefeller Center. half block from 5th ave and all the nice stores. Walking distance to Central Park, Broadway and Times Square, etc. Subway station across the street. Really, can't be beat! Very convenient midtown location, halfway on 51st between 5th and 6th. Hotel has a dining room, nearby is a store where sundries if need can be purchased. Room was adequate, bed reasonably comfortable. IT is not a luxury hotel, but the location couple with the room rate was great. Elevators can be slow, plan adequate time when departing if you have a deadline to meet. I enjoyed my stay, especially that my room was fairly quiet. I appreciated the water filter with water bottles in the hall. It was a pretty convenient location, with Rockefeller Center just across the way. Checkout was a breeze. The elevator is very quick (and so quick that it made me slightly car sick actually). I stayed here 4 times in last 5-6 years  each time it losses stars :-(   housekeeping will not honor requests, extra towels IMPOSSIBLE  gotta keep calling desk! leaves wet towels in room, and those towels are like sandpaper. (gotta order new towels sometime? no??? terrace restaurant was the worst ever. coffee light (too much water) (saving $$ on grounds )? :-)))and terrible food in general better going elsewhere, buffett was sparse and fair at best. air conditioner did not work on check in, sent repair man hours later :-( , mattresses need an upgrade, they do not last forever. (i hate to tell em)  this is a pricey chain, i like this location but have also found other boutiques right round the corner for approx  $100 less a night! I love this place ( way it used to be) but since no one cares?? (as i told them this)  and was offered an I'M SORRY only (and i cannot spend that anywhere except changing my next stay and hopefully whoever reads this will too! too bad used to be my fav hotel in manhattan The hotel is located across the street from Rock Center, down the street from Radio City Music Hall, walking distance to Broadway shows and Museum of Modern Art. I took a quick cab from Penn Station (Most repairs are done by now, check to be sure). I appreciated the free, filtered water and recycled bottles available next to the elevators. The room was nice, very clean. I have no problem with small rooms, so not an issue. Only two things bothered me: There is no mini-fridge and I usually have something left over. There was no place to lay my suitcase except across the desk, which meant unplugging the coffee pot and moving it. I enjoy coffee at cafe's, so the loss of the coffee maker is no problem, but I like to open up the suitcase so it made the desk unusable and a bit cramped. I had room service twice and recommend the warm chicken sandwich with a nice, dark green leafy salad. It arrived in no time and was a nice, healthy meal before flying out of there over to the theater. This is my second stay, and though the place looks a bit more worn out than the first time, still a good deal. I will stay again. close to Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's. Basic clean room-perfect for spending the day, but not too on a room I was not able to be on NY on the dates reserved, i tried to change my reservation but they did nothing and they did not even offer a partial refund! ! Rooms a bit small but standard for NY. Bed was comfy and the hotel clean. Complimentary wine at 5 was nice. Housekeeping fell a little short replenishing towels and shampoo. Everything else was very good. Water bottles on each floor is a great add. We had a great stay. The hotel is across from Radio City, in the middle of all attractions. NYC rooms are always going to be small - so I figure if you manage to find a deal under $200 its a miracle no matter how small it is! CQ was clean and staff were so friendly. We arrived early and they held our bags no problem - and even texted me when the room was ready early. I would have paid more to stay there! We enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel staff were very helpful. The food was good and the rooms clean and comfortable. Very easy to get to from LaGuardia. Everything you need is at the hotel. The location of CQ is the overwhelming accraction for us, but the hotel itself is excellent. The rooms are nicely appointed and very comfortable. The staff is very helpful and friendly and the amenities are comparable to hotels that are 2x to 3x room per night We have been to CQ many times and will go back the next time we go to NYC Rooms too small. Some upgrades/repairs needed. Had a problem with heat and thermostat that hotel maintenance staff repaired promptly. Restaurant has 3-4 tables that over look Rockefeller center as well as a small outdoor area one can have a drink they're both on 7 th floor. I think the hotel needs more elevators there Are only 2 & it can take really long to wait for one. There is No lobby and very few staff members to check guest in & out so you may have to allow extra time for the check in or check out process. Great location! Was great stay. The room was clean and everything was good. Will definitely stay there again. We have never stayed here before. I had never even heard of Club Quarters Hotel before but I will definitely use this hotel again. Within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. Great friendly staff. Parking available 1 block away. We have stayed several times at Club Quarters near Rockefeller Center and always been pleased with the experience. It's clean, friendly, great Manhattan location, and grateful such a place exists. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, the staff are friendly, the rooms very nice and clean, dining great, a perfect location, I'll be back! Thank you,  Richard Dwyer I enjoyed my stay at club quarters. Friendly and professional staff. Great quiet location  in time square . My only complaint is they don't give you enough towels in the room. Overall I loved it and will be back. Restaurant, and hotel staff were great. Had the best club sandwich from room service. Issue was with the condition of the rooms. They looked nothing like the pictures on the website - completely beat up fixtures/paint/walls/furniture. Lobby is tiny, uncomfortable, and uninviting. I would not stay here again. Air conditioner did not work toilet did work mattress horrible what else can I say to much to say Can't beat the location-between Radio City Music Hall and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Hotel staff very pleasant and rooms are fine, but small. Not a place to hang out but perfect to crash after a day of NYC sights. Excellent parking deal w/ lot 1 1/2 blocks down the street. We were given a warm welcome upon our arrival and although we had a couple of issues with the toilet and lights not working during our 12 day stay, these issues were rectified in a timely fashion by lovely maintenance staff.
Even it is cheaper, I am sure this is not excuse for have not normal conditions in a hotel. I tried give chance to this hotel specially for the rating. Toilet no working. No soap. No shampoo. Problems with plumber too. Noisy. Located in a dirty street and the view basically is for some old buildings or streets. The rating for this hotel is not real, maybe because is managing for locals and make it very improvised. This accommodation is a hostel, not hotel and is basically for sleep. When i went to check in. There was only one guy on the front disk.. He was checking in a group and i was already booked through the website... I was waiting for 15 minutes till someone else came and checked me in.. In 5 minutes... At 8.30 i asked for a glass (empty glass) after i called 4 times the glass arrived at 10:00 .. They disnt even apologiz for this... At 12 am i heard a lady shouting outside... I opened the door found out that she was waiting outside her room for more than 30 minutes for the maintenance guy to open her room door (as the lock battery was empty) that what they said. No water, coffe, heater nothing inside the room.. Doesn't deserve 2 stars Language barrier.dusty, not cleaned,bed sheets dirty/stained.smoking in reception and at entrance.staff on your desk asking higher prices and dishonest.very noisy and polluted area.men doing their business in the street.bell boys asking for commission to arrange uber taxi and introducing to private car drivers . Requests made to leave Windows open ignored.mould in bathroom and damaged carpets.poor quality breakfast without fruits or fresh juice.cheap toilotries. More like 2 star hotel. Manager never appeared.mr haisham. its a full service hotel the breakfast for $5 is worth more than $30 i couldn't believe the price i paid  compare to other places in Europe ,i stayed in paris in a junk youth hostel called republic or in the republic paid Eu 40 was the worst place on earth  compare to this no way i recommend this hotel to every body The hotel is a little season. Apparently it was re-brand and was called something else before. The facilities are quite old. But if you are looking for value for money, then this is the place. Some more it is located in Giza. Actually this hotel doesn't deserve even 3 stars, and I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. I had a bad experience, the bed was not comfortable and the sheets were dirty and yellow. Completely was not like pictures The hotel rooms are clean FO manager and guests relation are very friendly and professional hotel location is great but the breakfast needs more attention plates and cups need to be replaced with newer ones lobby is poor and AC is bad Hotel staff is great. I slept in the king size room suite. Well that's what they told me, it has a balcony- very noisy highway. It is 1 hour away from CAI and 15 min from pyramids w. traffic. Bathroom was not clean, shower curtain had mildew was afraid to touch it. I did not sit on toilet-it was not clean. Old red carpet, very hard. I only stayed 1 night and that was long enough. Gift shop sells nice things in lobby. Nice hotel, partial view of the Pyramids. In the middle of a very busy street. A lot of noise, but not an issue for my wife and I as we wanted to experience Cario, not tourist Cario. Overall a nice place, needs some new carpet, but other than that it's good for the price. First time and last, the location in horrible st, for how is looking for cheap hotel This is a very misleading hotel. They are listing photos that are not even close to reality. I checked on my fist day, and a saw a lot of Moroccan beating each other, the 2nd day was the same. Rooms are so dirty. I had to leave earlier and lose 2 nights.... I even asked to talk to guest relationship, and never gave me time. Not safe at all The hotel Wes not clean and it was very far from the downtown also I think this hotel was too old. Moreover Housekeeping very bad staff not trained.restaurant staff very awful especially Karima she is very bad attitude.most of the staff not wearing uniforms In one word Horrible. No sat TV, no wifi, pool with anything inside except maybe crocodiles, dirty cups and glasses, reused brakfast buffet, the groom made faces on every request, holes on the walls....4 star hotel? Not even in my dreams! And the area? We almost got attacked because we wore western clothes! One of the worest hotel in the world. Only one positive thing is the receptionist.she is very good .she called heba .and nothing else in the hotel. we went early to the hotel at 9am and they didn’t let to do the check in until 12 even I said we will do early check in. Also all the couches in the lobby are broken, the room are bad condition and the bathroom omg nasty with mud my blanket was blanket was broken.
Family room was quite small but just about big enough. Great hotel with great service. A wonderful relaxing stay in a beautiful area. An easy and safe 5-10 min walk into the town. Would definitely stay there again. great hotel and location super friendly and helpful staff will revisit again when going back to lake garda We had a great  stay - here for 4 nights, nice breakfast & exceptional service Nice hotel, Fantastic view from the front rooms, good parking, friendly staff, wonderful meals. Short walk to the Castle and Duomo. Lovely hotel in a great location - has very pretty gardens and swimming pools. Breakfast and dining room were also lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Recently came back from Hotel Piccolo Vela. Couldn't fault the hotel location or condition. 5-10 min walk to Desenzano centre for restaurants/shops/cafes with ferry stop for exploration of the Lake Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and happy to provide local information  Would recommend and definitely revisit Stayed 9 nights at this charming little hotel with excellent facilities and staff. Breakfast was great as was the grounds and swimming pools. Great lake view from hotel balcony. Only complaints where the small rooms as there was really no place to place our suit cases, especially if you wanted to unpack the contents. Also the internet connections in the rooms were spotty at the best. Besides that no complaints.
We stay at this hotel each time we need to take our daughter to the children's hospital, the hotel is in a great location and is close to plenty of restaurants, it's clean and tidy, has a great selection of buffet breakfast, staff are very helpful. My family and I stayed at the Best Western Plus Hotel Diana for a week in June. The room was new, clean and comfortable, and the staff - especially Danny - were friendly. What I enjoyed most was the complimentary use of the hot spa and sauna in the basement - it was hassle-free and a great way to relax after a day out. Really enjoyed my stay there and would book at the hotel again when we next visit Brisbane! Spent two nights here. Check in was easy and staff were very pleasant. Hotel has a restaurant and cafe on the main floor, nice looking buffet breakfast served in the morning for a fee. Room had an oversized jetted tub. There are a lot of shops directly next door, as well as a lot of activities within a short walk. Our stay here was relaxing and the room was private and quiet. staff were friendly and helpful, but there's not much to do in the area, and nearby shops are often closed. Room was clean and neat. King size bed was two single beds pushed together. Breakfast was not included and cost $14 per person for a simple buffet breakfast. Elevators are slow and for the last two days one was out of order. Pleasant staff. Good location close to shops and restaurants but very noisy (karaoke restaurant next door). Great hotel, nice staff. The 2 bedroom with kitchen for family of 4 was a bit small, maybe good for a short stay. A very comfortable and clean room with all facilities. Close to the Mater Hospital, South Bank and the city. Parking on site. Great location. Easy walk into the city through southbank gardens. Free parking. I was very satisfied with my room because I got upgraded to a family suite from a single room. The room was big and comfortable, but the only issue I had was the hot tub. There were balls of hair and dirt when I turned it on, suggesting that the hot tub had not been cleaned properly. But other than that, the whole room was very nice and pleasant. had cockroaches in bathroom, in cupboards in kitchen there was what look like mouse poo in top cupboard, when pulled toaster down all the crumbs fell all over me,  when paying $269 a night think standard should be a bit better Travelling to Brisbane with family to enjoy the Big Bash, we were lucky enough to find Best Western Diana. Great facilities within walking distance of Gabba. Will certainly be recommending this hotel! The room and amenities were great plus excellent breakfast Sunday morning. No complaints other than no computer with printer that was accessible for guests to print boarding passes. They finally let me use the concierge's computer. Great location  Nice stay Value for money  No need to worry about car parking Loved it will be back especially when spa has undergone renovations great staff free parking good buffet breakfast movie Chanels free clean rooms great prices for everything If i was to complain about anything it would be the hardness of the mattress. Other than that excellent. I will stay there again excellent for the short stay in the city . polite and helpful staff. good location for touring the city. clean and tidy room with brilliant shower Close to Southbank, hospital, pub and restaurants, free spa downstairs, updated rooms and bathroom. Just needs a bigger sign outside when approaching from the north THIS HOTEL IS  UNDERATED. THE VERY BEST VALUE FOR MONEY YOU WILL EVER FIND AND FREE PARKING  IN BRISBANE .AND YOU ARE MISSING OUT IF DONT HAVE THE FULL BUFFET BREAKFAST Nice room, nice staff - breakfast.... don't take it - bathroom is not smal, but shower, toilet and sink are very tight and in the rest of the room is nothing. Was great, close to amenities that I required & quite. Great hotel, great service and great breakfast. Loved it. Very friendly and helpful staff. Reception desk clerk was excellent. Good location, The Gabba just in 20 mins by foot and Mater hospital just across the road. Staffs are very friendly. Unfortunately the bathroom is not very clean. A hair in the shower which is understandable but the toilet had a marks on the toilet seat cover. Staff were great. Showed a sense of humour. Stayed here before so we knew what it was like. Good hotel, and we had a great room that had a good ensuite (renovated since our last stay). Would stay here again. Danny at reception went above and beyond and made our stay perfect. The area is so easily accessible and convenient. Great value for money. My daughter and I flew to Brisbane from our home town and so had no form of personal transport. I booked two nights at the Best Western Plus Hotel Diana as it was in very easy walking distance to Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. My daughter had to be at the hospital by 0615 in the morning in preparation for a procedure so the location of the Motel was perfect. The room was very clean and comfortable. Right next door was a a selection of restaurants and take away stores as well as a convenience store so it was super easy for us to find dinner etc. We also managed to stroll down to South Bank from the Motel one afternoon  (1.3k walk) for a swim which was lovely. I will definitely book in there for my daughter's future appointments. When I arrived, I spoke to Kristy/kirsty at the desk, where she said hello while looking at her computer, & treating me as just another routine transaction! She immediately asked for the payment of the first 2 nights upfront, and a 'surprise deposit' of $50.00 to be taken as well for 'who knows what reason'? as this was not stated on the booking system with wotif, she continued to argue the point that it did. I said well no, it didn't clearly state any amount before making the booking through the website & it should, so you know what your up for, she just continued to disagree and said well that's the way they do it on their website which they cant control.. and that's our policy? I asked for a copy of the 'agreement' I was asked to sign and she said WHY DID I WANT ONE? I said so I can read the terms & for my own record, then she gave me a copy that was printed too light so I couldn't read any of my or important info. She was 'unpleasant & just wanting my money, and I felt locked in to stay for the full 2 nights without being able to cancel one night, without losing payment, due to changes of plans! She then told me my holding deposit wouldn't be available till 5 or so days later! Now I could have needed to use that money for something else! Any cancellation charges, upfront deposits ( which I don't agree with especially when you have paid the full price for the booking) or hidden additional costs should be clearly stated BEFORE you make the booking! and the Air Con was loud! Not worth the money go to mcdonalds . Toaster didnt work. Bacon stewing and broiling in water. Great place to stay,  close to southbank, Brisbane cbd, pubs,  restaurants and cafes. Very clean rooms. Hotel staff excellent, definitely will be staying again! Found a piece of hair in my omelette.. Was a very bad experience... Lovely staff, nice breakfast  Not the best beds or pillows  Clean and tidy. Close to Southbank and Gabba. Disappointing second bed for families. Café/ Bar closes to early. Close to South bank walking distance. Shops next to Hotel  to pick up any essential items. We booked late and were very happy with our cho uce to stay at Hotel Diana. Loved that hotel had spa services attached to Hotel... and that stay included use of Bathouse. Bathroom was not clean. Overall appearance of hotel was beginning to show signs of disrepair. Man at reception was unpleasant. We were book for 3 nights, but due to my operation being postponed until the following week the hotel was willing to move our booking until the following week. We have stayed here a few times and find it convenient to the hospital s. Staff are friendly . The rooms are always clean. This hotel is a great location if you're visiting the hospitals like we were. The only downfall is the beds are very hard and not a great nights sleep at all. If there was comfy beds we would continue to stay here while we have to keep going down to the hospitals. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Rooms well kept and very clean . unpleasant purpose with nice accommodation experience Tired condition. Broken down lift (1 of 2) for some months, cleaners not doing their job all that well (if at all). Overall the hotel was great. I think the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, especially the toilet and shower. The toilet was very dirty under the bowl rim. Very clean and really nice except the room was quite small with no moving space and mattress sunk in the middle which killed my back by morning The room was nice, however not cleaned very well. Lip marks on the glasses, left over food found under the bed (found by my sister who is a hotel cleaner), and cutlery not cleaned very well. Was comfortable for a 1-night stay. In a good location too for shops, restaurants etc. I spent two nights and it was very clean and comfortable. I slept well and breakfast accommodated my needs perfectly. I strongly recommend this hotel if you need a reasonably priced hotel where the services a for your maximum comfort. Overall very good with very helpful staff. Excellent fitness center.
I checked in late at night as travelling from Zürich via train so got there around 11pm. Service was fast for check in as no queue and the man on the desk was very polite, effiecent  and helpful and told me that they have a free shuttle bus to airport, as I was going to use the bus at 5am in the morning which stops directly outside of Hotel. Also early morning call was given on time plus shuttle bus on time. My room, was on the 9th floor,  the bed was really comfortable clean and very insulated against sound from outside or rooms nearby. The stay was only for a few hours as I did not try the breakfast etc or facilities. The only thing personally that is a bit bold for me is the paint job of the walls in the lounge area next to the bar and check in desk ....It is all red... apart from that I'm sure it is all good and it served its purpose for me, so would use again. Clean Good breakfast great staff nice touch with the free public transport cards Friendly staff with good facilities in the central bar & reception area. Did not eat at the hotel or use the gym on this visit. Arrive in the 50 bus from the airport - used the shuttle service back in the morning Room fine and hotel provided free shuttle to the airport. The dining experience was terrible - staff could care less and the food choices were not very good. Eating in the casino was not an option. Our plans changed somewhat and the reservation/price included breakfast. They would not refund me the difference. Amazing stay, staff was friendly and room was very nice Apparently with Expedia booking there are no amenities provided like shampoo lotion etc Quiet and comfortable beds. BSL airport is actually in France (not Switzerland), so was unable to reach hotel by my cell phone for shuttle. Taxi was $24. Be sure to know how to phone from France to Switzerland number for hotel shuttle service which is complementary. Hotel staff said that any people have this issue Staff was exceptional. Service was exceptional. Provided shuttles to and from the airport. Rooms are large for a European city. I would highly recommend. I had a quick visit to the Basal Airport Hotel. Although it is not in downtown Basel, the number 50 bus runs frequently and allows you to connect to any place in this quaint city. The hotel provides a transit pass for free rides on trolleys and buses. The casino and the restuarant are the only amenities near this hotel. However, it is also air conditioned which is important if you arrive during a rare heat wave. Staff at reception extremely helpful and efficient. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Price tonight was affordable. Hotel did what it said on the tin. It was pleasant enough, a little bit dated but comfortable and convienent for the airport . Staff friendly Only stayed the night was very clean. Staff seemed friendly. I would have liked some small extras such as tea, coffee etc that you often get with hotels. The pillows could have been more comfortable but in general the room was spacious, comfortable and shower room were good working order Dirty towels, old gown, bedding was smelly We stayed at Airport Hotel Basel one night in July 2016 as we had a very early flight from the Mulhouse airport the next morning. We found the hotel comfortable, modern, and with a nicely designed and amply sized room. The hotel is adjacent to a casino, which would offer an opportunity to relax for those with an interest in such pass-times. The staff were courteous and helpful, and we thought the cost was quite reasonable. Apart from the casino there is not much to see in the immediate area of the hotel, but they offer a free bus into town if you have the time. They also offer free transport to the airport. For someone needing a quick connection to the airport, this is a good choice. 2nd visit to this hotel. First visit was ok, however this visit wasn't good. Hotel advertises beds as being king however they are queen. Hotel's website states free parking but when you get to the hotel they advise you it is only those who book directly with them who get free parking (their website doesn't clearly state this - previous visit was free). Heating was on permanently which meant a 30C+ room temperature, impossible to sleep. Walls are paper thin, could hear everything neighbours said and the walls would move anytime a neighbour closed their door. When these problems were pointed out to staff, they became aggressive and dismissed all of this. Sadly won't be back. Excellent and friendly staff. Thomas at the reception desk is always very kind. Very convenient by cost-benefit The location was very good for public transportation. This is a very good hotel for travelers wishing to have airport transfers. There is even a chance that you can arrange a transfer to the River Cruise port. The transfers are not guaranteed but are possible if you arrange in advance and the driver is available. Good staff and very good location. Very friendly and helpful staff at Registration. Easy free bus to Basel Airport as well as free public transportation ticket to town center. Nice breakfast available for purchase. Gregory at the front desk is awesome! Very friendly staff overall. Anthony so patient with all my questions. Their computers can be a little slow, do allow 20min to check out. Otherwise, everything was better than expected for our group of 4.
When you first arrive, be prepared to walk up three flights of stairs with your luggage. The room is very plain but clean. No view from our window. Had a private bathroom that was outside our room with a separate key. Nice breakfast in the morning. There is only paid wifi. But close to lots of great sites and shopping and food. This hotel is well located...very near the Rialto bridge and a few minutes walk to St.Marks Square. Think about when Venice was thriving...a time before electricity and modern  conveniences. This hotel would be where you, a traveller, would stay. Hence, There is no elevator....you are walking up 2 flights to the reception, with bags, but once there...it is lovely, bright, clean and does have modern conveniences. The rooms are not fancy but have what you need. They serve a continental breakfast and the staff are helpful. We were lucky enough to have a room with windows on 2 canals! How Venetian! Wind you way through narrow streets to the main sights! This is a great place to soak up all that is Venice from....at an affordable price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. the staff and management were incredibly rude. once i made my reservation and they received the money they were unresponsive over the phone, unwilling to accommodate any request and extremely unfriendly. You have to remind to yourself that is a two star hotel. Our experience was a little bit tricky as we were tired and at 11:00PM the fire alarm started (someone was smokings in his room) and it went for about 30 minutes at least). Some rooms have their own bathroom outside  the room. Fine experience lovely staff not their fault for hotel design I found the room to be in excellent condition, especially considering this is rater a 2-star hotel. Breakfast includes toast, an excellent croissant, espresso, and plenty of orange juice. Breakfast would easily cost 7-9 euro nearby. The hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating. Small room with a double bed with no view at all. Expensive for what it was but I guess that's central Venice for you. Walls seemed paperthin and very noisy in the morning with other guests and cleaners banging doors. Staff overall were very nice however and didn't have an issue with management or cleanliness.
It was very good hotel for staying and we stayed only one day but It was very nice experience. The service was very good. They take of everything. The room was very nice and pleasant atmosphere. The food was very tasty and we tasted all south Indian food item. It was very nice experience. The hive is one of the best hotel for staying and as I was a south indian, the hotel was perfect and the food was very tasty and delicious. The management was very good and the room was very neat maintained and everything was very good at the hotel. It was nice experience. We were very tired when we reached this hotel. The service was very nice, they received very well and shown the room. It was very pleasant room and everything is nice in that room. After we had dinner. It was very tasty dinner and desserts were very tasty. It was very nice experience. As per my review it is one of the best hotel in Chennai. It looks very beautiful from outside, it's front gate is very nice. It resides in the heart of Chennai, the hotel management and staff are very friendly with customers. The food provided is hygienic and delicious. The rooms are clean and well-maintained, the cost is not high compared to other hotel. Facilities like Internet and gym is awesome. Finally I recommend all to visit the hotel. It is good hotel to stay and it was very good experience to us. The hotel was very decent and very well-maintained. The rooms were very spacious and very cool after we had breakfast and was very tasty. Hotel staff is helpful and room services is quick. Location was great. Trivago listed the hotel as near to MEPZ but it was actually ~20kms away. But no complaints. it took us only 45 min in peak hours and 30 min in non-peak to and fro office. Good overall experience. There is no lift and that's a big dampener. Good Wi-Fi connection and hassle-free too. Good Food. Recommended The place is simple for a business stay. The food cooked in house kitchen is clean and freshly made. we had nice stay. spacious rooms with all facility . cooperative staff ...food is awsm..

Improvement or increase staff Good and satisfactory More items should be included in the menu. breakfast needs to be improved
Torn curtains.tired decoration,grubby not an Oaks Hotel as confirmed by them when I contacted them.Staff friendly car park awkward to access.Position within Hamilton was good Checked in, got a key to a room. Opened it up, met with the overwhelming smell of mold. Asked the front desk for another room. Got escorted up, it was a bit better. Still swelteringly hot. Within five minutes I was feeling sick from all of the biohazards in the room. Found a different hotel and told the front desk we were leaving. Front desk suggested they could send up some air freshener. I said it was making me sick and we walked out. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away. Whilst everything functioned okay, the hotel was very old. The tiles in the bathrooms were cracked. Windows were cracked / broken or had plastic covering the glass. The beds were uncomfortable and the noise from surrounding areas (even on the second floor) was loud. The rooms have paper thing walls. It has WIFI, but this is extremely slow. The room was clean and tidy and had the basics you expect (tea/coffee facilities, TV, Sky). The staff weren't over friendly - possibly some language barriers. When booking in, the receptionist thought I wanted 2 rooms (because there were 2 of us!). The receptionist then charged me for the room that had been booked 2 months prior despite me saying I had already paid through Expedia. After I was able to show her proof (later), she agreed to arrange for the appropriate refund but not until another staff member could check it (next day). Airconditioning in the room (all rooms it turned out) was not working. We sweated through the night (no sleep), as we could not open the main window because of the street noise below. Great hotel, near Cbd itself. Food and bar is all around easy access. Victoria by the river park is a great place to chill and hang out with a lil picnic with the fam Clean and comfortable, however NO aircon ... very hot room! Bathroom had NO extractor fan so steamy. Great room, comfy bed but some evidence of damp and bugs in room. It was great to see new carpet in the hallways. Rooms are in desperate need of air conditioning - WAY TOO HOT. The hotel is in a great location, the rooms are a fabulous size. but it does need some TLC to bring the hotel back up to a good standard. Chose the hotel because it offered a room with Queen bed and two Single beds, perfect for our family of 4. Room was spacious, with high ceilings. Only issue it that the off-street parking (which is free, by the way) is in a garage with very difficult access for a mid-size car or larger. Beware and ask for a parking spot that you can access with the size vehicle you have. Otherwise, hotel was really good. Hotel is very dated and no aircon. My parents in law stayed in a room that was incredibly hot, windows did not open, no sleep for them, very disappointing. In my room at least the windows opened a little bit which made it reasonably bearable. I will never go there again, for the price they charge I would have expected much better! :( Close to city restaurants etc. Parking is available and rooms are large and tidy. Good location in city. Large room. Old hotel  but nice and tidy Spent from 2:30pm  to 6pm in the room. Attended birthday party from 6pm-11pm  There are no facilities like swimming pool and hot tub. Spacious and comfortable rooms in CBD close by to restaurants and shops Very noisy and room was very hot ( not due to the weather) so had to have noisy air con on all night. Could hear plumbing from other rooms through the night and noisy pub / restaurant clientele until 3.00 am every night, then road cleaners and truck traffic from 3.30 am! But if you like to party and stay up to 3.00 am good location for you! A  nasty smell bring covered up with cleaner was not pleasant. Lots of night noise from outside. Only problem we found was bathroom fan extremely noisy  Bathroom door had load squeak  Front staff were very helpful Great parking and very secure We were VERY Happy with our stay in the hotel. We had a lovely big room and it was very comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. We enjoyed our time there and would go back again. No airconditioning in rooms made it uncomfortable, they need to make it operational The room we stayed it has a very aged, old smell like something in the carpet you can't get rid off. Called reception they said it is fully booked out that night, no chance for changing to another room. Not even any explanation of that smell. In order to get some fresh air in,  we opened the window a bit then to find out later that night there were at least 10 mosquitoes and insects on the wall of the room. The wall behind the curtain has a serious damp issue, very disgusting. Great comfortable room. Very cosy bed in a great location. I thought it was great for the price. Huge spacious rooms and bathroom right in the heart of town A very convenient place to stay surrounded by restaurants and bars. The room was furnished as of a bygone era, and although showing some signs of age, it felt authentic. The room was also amazingly spacious. The only real let down was the view. Great location with easy access to many cafes and bars. The lovely river is close by. A massive room with all amenities required. The free car park was nice, free paper too! Some of the decor does require some attention. Opening windows wasn't easy, and lots of cobwebs. The walls seemed paper thin, very noisy from people talking next door. Hotel was great. Checked in minutes. Room was missing a single bed was was upsized immediately to a bigger room. Room was extremely big. Very impressed with size  and cleanliness. Beautiful bathroom needs upgrading of showers n toilets. Ok beds. Abit noisy at night due to being in Main Street  but overall very impressed with everything. Stayed 1 night First impression was a nice large room however, our king bed was two singles pushed together. My hubby spent most of the night slipping between the beds!! This is not a 4 star hotel as stated! The TV was the size of a postage stamp! The fan was a pedestal fan! Aircon? We woke at 6.30 to the tv noise from our neighbors! This hotel needs a revamp! Very old and worn down. Parking is terribly spaced out, reception don’t really care about you. Facilities in the room is pretty bad. Very stuffy and no aircon available. One window was nearly shattered. Terrible sound proofing, could hear neighbor blow his nose! We used a family room and it was spacious and clean. However the room windows were open and the room was very hot and had mosquitoes. One window we managed to close but the other one was broken and we couldn't close. There was no air conditioning and we were given pedestal fans (Receptionist was very helpful) but they were not enough to make the room comfortable at all. As a result we sweated throughout the stay. Although the room was good but the lift and the parking area Stinks. Great location and loved the bed, however mould on the curtain netting which was off putting and availability of the car park was also a nuisance Room nice and big. Clean. Bed comfortable. Bathroom huge but dated. Room was extremely hot as aircon not working properly. That was the only drawback. Worst even had in staying in a hotel Cricket trip, so wanted a location close to the ground. The VR is situated on the main bar street so great for restaurants and drinks Loved the huge rooms and old school charm Excellent location and friendly staff. However, Hotel is showing signs of age... Broken (cracked) windows, Windows that would not close, Tables with broken legs etc. Rooms had very high ceiling (which made the unit feel very roomy) but meant quite a few cobwebs and lack of cleaning in the hard to reach areas. Hotel has limited car parking, which is undercover, and some of the spaces are very difficult to navigate. Booked Hotel due to its good location in town and free parking. fine print reads limited and limited it is. At 5pm all parks were gone. Suggested solutions from staff was to drive around for an hour then street parking would become free from 6pm, this was the last thing i wanted to here considering i had just been through rush hour traffic. Main elevator is small and feels unsafe. Has a automatic fly spray that sprayed in my face as i walked in. There were also flies in the room. We call room service to bring some fly spray but they just didn't show. No air con, fine print. Must open windows to get air flowing. Noise pollution from the main road was crazy all night long. Room smelt damp. Place was just rundown, run by amateurs. Suggestion. If you can't offer everyone a free park, don't offer free parking. Make it valet parking instead. Put in heat pumps. We visit Hamilton fairly often and always stay at VR. The service is excellent, staff are always so friendly, welcoming and accommodating to our needs. We find the rooms clean and comfortable and have a homely feel, it's always a pleasure to be able to relax here. The hotel is an original, historic and grand building which retains period décor, but with modern conveniences one would expect. We find this very charming. The location is central and handy to everything. We look forward to our next stay. Arrived early evening. Ok welcome. However, at check-in male FOH tried to dispute free car park that came with booking, saying it was subject to availability, and asked if we would park on the street even though there were car parks available in hotel parking. Rude. I had to insist on parking in hotel car park. Received room key. Got up to room and it was very hot. No AC, just fan. Also, discovered a broken window with broken glass exposed and couldn't shut. H&S risk! Called reception, spoke to a lovely young Māori lady who assisted us. Asked to change rooms. Only available room was one that was extremely hot with only fan, or room with broken lock which couldn't be locked from outside with guest key. Chose second room option. She had to come up to the room to lock and unlock with master key when we wanted to go out and get back in. Discovered no fan or TV remote in second room once we tried settling in. Had to get her to assist again with that. She was very pleasant to deal with and very accommodating. VR's saving grace. Had a good sleep. Amenities in the room ok.  No problems at check-out. However, male FOH was very forward insisting I post a review about my stay, before asking me how my stay was. Odd. He was kind enough to let us leave the car in the car park for an hour past check-out while we had a quick look at the museum across the road. Got back to car with a lot of bird poop from pigeons nesting in parking building. Not the worst stay ever. But, below par. This is a perfect location for those who are going out on the town but not if you are staying in for the night. Room is very stuffy as there is no air con. The tiny fan in the room only blows around hot air the TV is way too small for the size of the room bathroom needs urgent repairs and the curtains have mildew on them u have too keep the windows open all night as it's just way too hot in those rooms and then it becomes too noisy so you just can't win, and as for the parking its absolutely horrible very hard to get in and out of its very tight parking gives you a bad impression of the place from the get go. We received an unrequested wake up call on our last day and the cleaning person knocked on the door before 10am which caused us to leave our drinks in the fridge. The air conditioning was poor in the room but excellent in the hallways. Parking was extremely difficult to get in and out off. The rubbish by the back entry was rancid. The staff in general were quite unfriendly, many not saying hello. The free wifi access was terrible, often cutting out every few minutes. I booked the hotel because it had car parking. On arrival there was no mention of it so I asked at the desk . I was told that there was free parking on the street after three pm . When I said I wanted a car park I was told that car parking was tight and he asked me what size my car was . The concierge  was relieved when I said I would park on the street. Room was comfortable. The door hinges could do with lubricant spray. Small things make big difference Very pleasant stay as had business meeting and hotel very well situated in town. Overall was OK. The parking and shower was VERY disappointing. Would only stay there if I just needed a bed. This hotel has lovely staff. The hotel itself is getting tired, the room I got was one of the biggest I've ever had but the aircon was noisy. Loved the style of the rooms and hotel. Lots of gorgeous nooks and crannies and art throughout. Recommend for people going out in the neighbourhood although it can get a bit noisy if you are a light sleeper. Only complaint is the tiling on the bathroom floor. Super slippery even not wet so had major tumble out of the shower recess. Recommend hotel provide non slip bathroom mats for safety. We stayed for one night at VR Hamilton. The rooms were large and had an old-world elegance to them (if somewhat faded). We had to change our date for staying a couple of days before arrival and they were very helpful and allowed us to do this with no issues. Overall, I liked the atmosphere of this hotel and would stay there again. Beautiful room. Unfortunately noisy airconditioner outside room. Bathroom first class No air-conditioning, no luggage trolleys, have to cart luggage up stairs, no assistance, parking is a joke, surveillance cameras in room , no sound or heat insulation of windows to main street, By no stretch of the imagination is this an Executive Suite and is in no way Luxurious  We stayed elsewhere Reminded us of the grand hotel of Budapest. Big rooms. Nice verandah. Would visit again Not match the internet photos, at best a 3 star. Very disappointed I love this place - it's like stepping into a Wes Anderson film set. I love the history, the character, the décor - it's so much fun! I look for excuses to visit Hamilton so I can stay at the VR... long may it welcome visitors to the Waikato Nice Hotel but lack of carparking space. Room was nice and clean. Friendly staff. Great mannerism. Would recommend and stay again Worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Among many deferred maintenance issues the top three were, broken leg on the bed which created a 20 degree tilt, a faulty toilet that overflowed every time it was flushed and the toilet was filthy with congealed urine on the bowl and seat. Absolutely disgusting. I would definitely stay again. I love the space in the rooms and the high ceilings, all amenities needed were available and the bed was super comfortable. Only negatives would be the first in-first served car parks as we had to park on the street and check our car regularly. The windows were also cracked/broken in our room and one was hollow with cardboard so it was a bit cold! I specifically checked in early to reserve a car park - when I returned later that afternoon my park was taken by someone else. Got very little sleep as there was so much noise outside - I understand that the hotel cannot control noise  however I would not recommend to anyone that was a light sleeper.
I will not recommend this hotel.Room are very small,A/C is very poor and does not cool the room good enough. The housekeeping service was good (beds made everyday, towels replenished). It did not seem like they swept which was a bummer since we had a lot of sand from the beach. The front-desk staff was friendly and helpful, especially for hailing a taxi. Good things: -Close to central Cancun (which we like, others who are not comfortable with the language may struggle in this area) -Rooms were clean -Check-in and Check-out were simple and easy  The not so good: -No fridge or microwave in our unit (other units have fridges available) -No common toiletries; instead it had a school-style dispenser with an all in one soap for hair & body. -No water for consumption (very common in Mexico) -Shower water pressure was not the greatest (it is just a shower, no tub)  Overall we were happy and satisfied for the price of the hotel. Traveling to and from the main Hotel zone (also referred to as the 7 by other reviewers) was simple and only cost us about 150 pesos each way. Very comfortable, quiet room; air conditioning was a little noisy. Fantastic shower. Breakfast was great value for money. Wifi was very fast. Nice business hotel, just could use a few more Amenities, rooms small but ok Double room slightly small but very comfortable. Amazing buffet breakfast. Staff is friendly and helpful. great location Where my experience was just getting around talking to a lot of people and get to know how everything works before you do it that way you won't get in trouble and fall in love not in Cancun by somebody Cancun lady Had no wash rags or hand towels, only 2 English Chanel's, had to keep getting the key reprogrammed due to it been disconnected DAILY,had to ask for the soap dispenser  in the shower to be refilled from the previous guest-was empty---neat Little room, however--just so many inconveniences AFTER A LONG DAY OUT AND TIRED UPON RETURN ONLY TO HAVE TO KEEP GOING BACK DOWNSTAIRS TO THE DESK OR CALLING TO RESOLVE ISSUES. NEED MORE REPS WHO CAN SPEAK ENGLISH ALSO. Rooms are clean. Walking distance to the Las Americas mall. Bus to the Hotel Zone can be hopped on right outside this hotel. Very clean,modern hotel with friendly staff. Room was clean.Missed swimming pool. More staff could speak English. Overall nice hotel. Good location downtown Cancun. Price was right for clean, inexpensive hotel. Rooms were simple, but clean. Bar and restaraunt on premise. Breakfast was fair. But, walking distance to a couple of nice restaurants. Check out Cafe Antoinette for breakfast.
I arrived very early in the morning (way too early for check-in). No coffee shops open for hours, so the friendly staff accommodated me by allowing me to store my luggage under the stairs and rest in the hotel's comfortable living room, where I was able to read my book, and even take a brief nap. When I was finally ready to check in, my room was immaculately lead. The mattress was a bit stiff, but OH SO WELCOMING after a long international flight. Breakfast in the morning was absolutely gourmet quality. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of all shopping, restaurants, and even a relaxing Mediterranean swim. I will definitely be back! ! Apparently, ritgh outdide is were bikers like to ride between 12 am and 3 am, and we could not sleep at all... tried closing windows but conditional was so beat down - god nows what kind of fungus lives inside- this hotel is only nice until you try to rest at night- the outside noise is just unbearble... It's a gracious, lovely hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and comfortable, the location ideal, and the breakfast included excellent choices. Excellent location at beginning of Liston Avenue. Countless shops, restaurants and lovely view of old fortress. We had a balcony which overlooked the Old Fortress in the fore with the beautiful cafe's and restaurants to our left. A lovely breakfast was available daily and the staff very friendly. Centrally located hotel within a short walk of the sites of the Old Town and a huge choice in restaurants, and cafes. Short walk to public buses provides easy access to nearby beaches and other parts of the island. Ideal for out of season visits (which is when I would visit Corfu).. The Arcadion is situated at the centre of Corfu old town, ideally located for shopping visiting the Old Fort and the many other attractions Corfu Town has to offer. There are many restaurants cafe's bars and eating places nearby. The hotel provided a very good breakfast with a good range of cold and hot food. This hotel is in a great location. Easy walk everywhere. Fortress is very close the market is close. The beds weren't too bad either. Good breakfast. Excellent location in the old city and easy walking distance to most things. The hotel is in very good condition and rooms are fantastic, ours had a balcony and view over the square and fort. Breakfast was very good, plenty of choice and staff helpful. Our room had a bath which was good for winter when you have been travelling for a while. We would definitely stay at Arcadion Hotel again. Everything was great the staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast was well done. Cleaning crew very efficient. Great location for those travelling on the religious trip - Saint Spiridon church is just 5 minutes away. You can appreciate evening promenades - a lot of restaurants within walking distance. Basic hotel but in a good location. Side rooms have NO views at all. Expensive mini bar in room, no free bottled water in the room! Supermarket around the corner, I used it for beer, water, snacks etc. Corfu town is Very Expensive now days. Excellent location and good breakfast. Room smelled like smoke but other than that, would recommend Great location, wonderful staff, fabulous breakfast Very clean hotel. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The location is perfect. Great central location, and there's a taxi stand just outside that has cars there starting about 7 in the morning The location was central however above a McDonalds. The staff were very friendly. Dining room for breakfast was small- however the breakfast itself was good. The beds are very firm so beware. I asked for blankets to put under the sheets to pad the very stuff mattress. Could use some updating to the lounge. The other thing I find fascinating is the lack of shampoo, etc...and very outdated blow dryer. Brilliant location, fantastic staff. Breakfast was fine but the dining room is a little cramped. The rooms are clean, bathrooms small but adequate. The bed was very hard, glad we were only spending one night! Conveniently located within few steps to everything - town center, dining, the fortress and even a small beach. Our room was nice and clean, the staff was very helpful. Hotel staff very helpful and an excellent location. Excellent choice and can fully recommend. We arrived very late but got a nice welcome. Comfortable room with nice view. Really good breakfast! Helpful staff. No roo m service..and in a very noisey room ..couldn't make a coffee in the room .. Hotel had a great location. Room was pleasing for one night. However, we paid a bit extra to ensure we had a nice park view. However, at night - it was SO loud. I think I did not fall asleep until 6AM (by no exaggeration at all), when the sound of motor bikes finally stopped. Apparently, motor bikes are common for Greece we found out. And by loud motor bikes, I mean LOUD. We would have closed the shutters/windows to the room, but the air-con was broken. Breakfast was fine. Was ok for one night, but wouldn't want to stay for longer.
I paid top dollar for the top floor and thought I was going to get a nice large room with a view. We did get the top floor but the room was far from roomy 2 queen beds which were hard and not comfortable the view was of the parking lot around back with a small deck . The house keepers did not replace the soap or shampoo the next day. The continental breakfast was pretty much emptied at 9:15am  We never did get a second cup of coffee . All in all the experience was ok but definitely not worth the money I could of stayed at the best western and had a better room in a nicer hotel. I stayed here with my partner and another couple. We had a premium room as well as an economy room. The premium room was great as we had extra space for all of our outdoor clothing as well as 2 sinks, which made it easier to get ready in the morning. The economy room was smaller but I did not hear any complaints from my friends. The storage room for skiing equipment was nice and warm and gave a ability to lock your gear to have peace of mind. The breakfast was good enough as it was free, good variety but we thought we had to go early in order to get seating. The outdoor hot tubs were the draw for us. We loved to use them everyday after skiing and allowed us to relax and not need to go to any other spas in the region. Location was great as we could walk to the grocery store and any restaurants nearby. The two shuttle stops to Lake Louise and Sunshine Village are extremely close to the hotel and make it very convenient to get to the resorts. Parking was also provided which was great. Overall, very happy with the stay and would stay here again in a heartbeat! We had a very enjoyable stay at Banff Aspen Lodge. Our room was large, with a separate lounge area. Ample parking, including underground options. 2 hot tubs with good capacity and the sauna and steam room were also very enjoyable. The option to divert spending from housekeeping towards charity or a voucher for the cafe was novel and well received. The laundry was the only area of frustration for us - a single washer and dryer for the whole hotel was inadequate and was always in use whenever we tried to use it. Overall our experience was ok.  Staff was great. The hotel itself you can tell is old and has been renovated. The rooms were small and nothing special....typical motel style with short 8' ceilings. The b-fast was nice and there was a decent selection and the service great and exceeded our expectations. Our only real complaint was that the room was very hot and dry and the thermostat did nothing to control the heat (room 234). We had to keep the window open and sometimes the door in order to keep the temp reasonable and in order to sleep. We stayed over spring break so the rates were higher than normal (approx. $250/night)....we still felt like we paid too much for the room even when the free breakfast was worked into the cost. The hotel itself seemed to be very well managed but we will probably try somewhere else next time. Indoor parking was a plus. Short walk to restaurants and entertainment. Great buffet breakfast included. This hotel is a great value. Staff was very helpful. Only suggestion would be more space/storage/drawers/hooks in the rooms, as we had a lot of gear. Yummy granola at breakfast. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The room was divided up into different areas so it is good for a family. The location was great for easy access to shopping and restaurants. Easy parking behind the hotel. Friendly staff. Hot tub, steam room, and sauna after skiing. Breakfast every morning included. Loved the beauty in this hotel -  breakfast was well-rounded and tasty, loved he outdoor hot tub‘s especially when it’s snowing at night and they have the outdoor fireplace running, room was small but cozy. This hotel was in the best location, walking distance to everything. The parking was underground, the hot tubs were amazing and the rooms were clean. Very nice situation. Close to points of interest. Booked this last minute for spring break with the kids. Clean and newly renovated. Rooms are modern, clean and spacious. Hotel staff is also super friendly. The free breakfast is also one of the better ones I've had in Banff. Will definitely visit again. We booked two adults and then our children`s plans changed and we arrived with 4 people. The hotel staff had no issues with this and we only had to pay the breakfast fee - which was very good as well. Thanks. This is a cute boutique hotel however the blankets were super thin room was freezing cold and you could bee loud shower noises from other units Place was clean and comfortable. Breakfast had plenty options. Good access to activities in Banff national Park. Pros: Full complimentary breakfast, hot tubs, steam room, sauna, free garage, functional design, comfortable beds, steps to restaurants and shopping, friendly useful staff. Our room was very quiet. Cons: rooms cleaned in the middle- dust in the corners, bed sheets and blankets had some funny spots. Breakfast is very good, however, sausages and beacon could be cooked less. Impressive fruit salad, but watermelon pieces looked slimy. Walkable location and great staff  Room was on the main level closest to lobby and across from the stairwell / elevator guests needed to use. Very noisy. We stayed for a week. Skiing, ice skating and site seeing. This was the perfect location to walk downtown and just a short drive to the ski resort. The rooms were perfect and the staff was so helpful and friendly. Breakfast was an added bonus and delicious. Would definitely stay again, loved it! My wife and I are primarily business travelers and spend about 200 nights a year living out of a suitcase therefore, this review may come across as overly critical but it is intended to help our fellow travelers in search of the ideal hotel to suit their needs. First, our room...we booked a room with a queen sized bed and ended up with a double that was fit for Fred and Wilma Flintstone. If you like a bed on the firmer side, this is your place however if you'd like a restful sleep without tossing and turning all night long to alleviate pressure points, there are MUCH better choices out there. Secondly...housekeeping appears to be asleep at the wheel. The shower curtain was heavily stained and reeked of mildew. We placed the curtain in the tub which was replaced the next day however one has to wonder why this would have been necessary in the first place. On a positive note, the front desk staff is very friendly, courteous and professional and the complimentary breakfast is outstanding and nothing provided free of charge by the major hotel chains comes close. These two pluses were somewhat of a recompense for the lousy mattress and the issue overlooked by housekeeping. That being said, a good night’s sleep trumps everything in our view therefore we won’t return unless this hotel invests in new mattresses. Good place to stay for a few nights. Spacious room, good location and good value for money. Breakfast was adequate, but not amazing Real diamond in the rough. Very good value. Comfortable and good location. Great breakfast and friendly! Room was right by the elevator, very loud. Bathroom area of room was quite small and cramped. Stay was fine however the cost was almost double what I would consider the room worth Very easy to check in and get oriented, great location and helpful polite staff, clean clean clean! Great stay at a great place, definitely would stay here again! Great location, very friendly staff, good breakfast, fun jacuzzis outdoor Sunshine and Lake Louise shuttle 50 yards away. Well worth the money. Friendly helpful staff. Clean comfortable rooms. Good breakfast selection. Relaxing hot spa. I would happily recommend this to people visiting the area. The staff at the hotel were amazing and friendly. The overall atmosphere was terrific, the outdoor hot tubs were a huge hit and a great way to end the day. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone going to Banff. My wife and I decided to spend a couple of days in Banff as a way of celebrating her birthday. The rates at Aspen Park Lodge were attractive and so I decided to take a chance on it. We were pleasantly surprised to find the lodge to more than meet our expectations. The lodge was bright and clean with friendly staff. We were upgraded to a premium room with a queen bed. The room was well appointed and spacious with great lighting. (I'm often disappointed with lack of good lighting for reading in most hotel rooms.) The lodge boasts two outdoor hot tubs as well as a steam room. The complimentary breakfast was a really pleasant surprise in that it was so much more than the usual coffee and danish on paper plates. In fact, it featured a wide array of cold and hot foods provided in pleasant surroundings. The lodge is situated right on Banff Avenue, close to shopping and other amenities. Our room was off in a back corner of the lodge and was extremely quiet with a great view. Really nice stay and very friendly staffs. Room was clean and comfortable. Only minus was fan noise when heater was on. Recommend Banff Aspen Lodge. We had a good experience at the Banff Aspen Lodge. The staff was helpful at check-in and throughout our stay. They helped us by offering restaurant suggestions, quickly taking care of the garage door when it wouldn't open for us, and by unlocking the garage door for us so we could leave at 3am. We observed that the staff was patient with the large number of Chinese guests even though the guests were sometimes hard to communicate with. The room was comfortable and fit our needs. Our only wish was that there were pocket doors on the bedrooms for more privacy. I booked the hotel as a place to sleep during a conference I was attending. I shared the room with another attendee, and was pleasantly surprised to find the room was basically two bedrooms separated by a washroom. This worked out perfect! The only downside was an extremely limited amount of parking. Otherwise the stay went off without a hitch. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The staff was wonderful. Unfortunately there is not air conditioning. This was a problem due to medical conditions. They did try to accommodate us by changing rooms. The breakfast and staff were wonderful. Everyone was very helpful. Very quaint; great breakfast. Staff eager to assist. Centrally located. What's not to like?
This hotel has potential to be exceptional if only they can brush up on a couple of key factors. Reception and wifi. The golf, rooms, food and general hotel ambience is superb. What lets it down is that there is no wifi which when questioned was told it is terrible and there is a desktop in reception that can be used. On advising a rather uninspiring and uninterested reception desk they did not care and when asked for the manager to write to for feedback they said he rarely opens his e mails so if you want a response to write to reception. Mmm but if you are also not happy with reception? First glance, nice hotel, a bit tired looking but nice pool and gym. A bit if a musty smell about the place too. Aircon non existent and rooms way too hot to sleep in. I had the added drama of the room above me flooding in the middle of the night and leaking into my room. Staff were very slow to help but eventually realised that I couldn't stay put for the night and gave me an alternative room with no window! ... which was even hotter!!! PLUS they charged me for the night even though I spent most of the night packing my bags, moving rooms and unpacking! When I complained they offered me the night for half price. I was so put off I left a day early. #poorcustomerservice Really like this hotel, however they had a major issue with the plumbing this morning. These things happen, but when I complained at checkout, I was spoken to like an idiot. So the water was like sewage smelly and yellow between 730 and 800. Apparently I should have cancelled my meeting and had a shower later after letting the water to run for 10 minutes. No apology, just very defensive defiant receptionist. Needs retraining, poor public perception. Excellent pool. How do they prevent condensation on the windows? Therapy staff were brilliant and the facilities were modern and well laid out. Room was clean and modern with view of the golf course. Would certainly visit again. Clean and comfortable rooms but the walls seem paper thin. We could hear conversations of people in next bedroom and in room above. Could also hear people using the toilet in room above! BUT the food and service in the golf club Terrace Restaurant was excellent and really saved the day! nothing more to add. nice but wifi a big let down. Very nice location and hotel was very comfortable. Staff helpful and efficient when we required them. Room and facilities were very good. The only negative point was that the hot breakfast, wasn't. Luke warm, would best describe this. Husband and i stayed for his birthday 21January 17,  had a superb weekend. Good facilities, friendly staff and comfortable room. pleasant stay, convenient location for travelling around the area Nice hotel with some lovely door served in the golf club next door. Great views and very friendly staff. Overall it was a very nice place to stay. This hotel was a perfect base for us to explore the Jurassic coast without being caught up in the tourist hassle. Unfortunately, the weather was too bad for any Golf but our stay was just as enjoyable. It did give us time to explore the area and enjoy the scenery. Once again our stay was a first class experience. clean and quiet room  good breakfast if a bit disorganised it was fine the room could need up dating the food was very good for lunch in the golf club house It was a real treat unfortunately we only had the time to stay the one night. Wish we could have stayed longer and taken advantage of the spa packages. Wonderful pool and spa facilities Delicious breakfast and evening meal in the Clubhouse Accommodating and friendly staff This was our 5th visit to the Woodbury, and we will be back. The upgrade to the spa facilities is definitely worth the visit. Food in the terrace bar, overlooking the golf course is always beautiful. A little bit disappointed that the hotel had lost or deleted my booking without explanation. Fortunately although the hotel was full I stayed in a huge lodge. This was a little dated, bathroom lights not working and no room service the bed left as per I left it. Glad it was only two nights, the receptionist was very helpful. To round it off it cost £20 to travel 5 miles to my place of work by taxi. Nothing wrong with the hotel but will look elsewhere in future. Food not what you'd expect for the price you pay example I had a steak onion rings were cold chips so hot took the skin off the roof of my mouth. Plate presentation or lack of it didn't impress. Golf course though is great bit hilly and lots of hazards study course lay out before hand and you'll enjoy it a lot more the green speed is second to none a real test of putting skill, spa centre bit of a let down pretty basic too functional no real relaxation area only a sauna and pool no character or atmosphere for chilling used it but was back in the room 45 mins later. As tilte said great place if your only going for Golf. My advice search for a deal then it may be worth a visit. A very nice room in a smart hotel in a lovely area. The food at the Terrace bar was good but the breakfast was not at all pleasant; eggs very hard, bacon was tasteless and the sausages not at all nice. I had the Continental breakfast on the second morning. My main criticism of this hotel was that most of the staff completely ignored me. I must have passed the reception a dozen times or more and not once did the on-duty receptionist, male or female, look up and ask me if everything was alright or a good morning or evening! The rest of the staff were the same: no greetings, enquiries or anything. The manager really has to give a short course on How to treat the guests who pay their wages. Go and visit a four star hotel in the States and see how they treat their guests!! Maybe it was because I wasn't a golf member! Stayed here as it was convenient for a meeting the following morning in Exeter, didn't eat in the evening as was too close to Exmouth and hadn't been before. Fantastic weather was a bonus, clear blue skies and warm. Exmouth a mere 15 minutes drive away along with a number of other seaside villages. Pubs aplenty in the area. Had breakfast in the morning in the Atrium restaurant and it was a good spread. Swimming pool and fitness facilities on site and rooms were well appointed and clean and tidy. Good shower too. Fantastic location and scenery to die for. Do I take up golf ?? ? Friendly, helpful staff My stay at Woodbury park was business related but also very enjoyable with the pool and golf. I would like to return with family and explore the area more. Great, super friendly reception staff. Food was great and the restaurant was beautiful but dimly lit which was lovely for dinner but not so good for breakfast! Good, comfy, clean room. Will stay again next time I'm in the area. Great hotel and great food however the tea & coffee need up grading A lovely venue with great service from all staff. Gorgeous bedroom and extremely comfortable beds - always a good thing! This is fairly local to us, 50 miles away, and is very convenient of travelling from Exeter Airport, or Exeter St. David's Train Station. We have started to stay there if we go to watch an Exeter Chiefs' game because it saves us a 1.5 hours' drive home and it's a very enjoyable stay. The food is very good and the staff friendly and welcoming. It has become my new favourite local place to stay. Good stay Pity there was no air conditioning in the bedroom. Staff were very nice. Leisure facilities were very good. Amazing. Great golf course. Helpful friendly staff. Comfortable room. Freshly cooked breakfast. Ample parking. Quiet. Great wifi. What more could you ask for Lovely location with nice rooms and very good food. I ate in the bar and the food was really nice - anti pasti starter platter was huge and the monkfish tails in salsa verde were delish. Good complex, accommodation and food good Comfortable and attractive hotel with nice modern rooms and a very good breakfast. Just a real problem getting reservation and desk staff to iron out a problem with the booking. I had two consecutive reservations made separately and all the way to the end of the first reservation the hotel staff seemed unable to link these to the same room. Only on my 5th attempt were these joined up (and I started trying some time before arrival) The hotel staff were welcoming, service exemplary, spa was really lovely.
Overall experience was good the bad could be a lot better for people that have back problems. Scrappin very accommodating. I think that the attempt to create an international  menu for the restaurant  was disappointing. Probably should’ve stayed to a German menu or concentrated on a regional cuisine and had it been more  authentic. Do not order the PHO bad very bad it was like  hey so are you sauce soup with hunks of tough meat. Very good choice for visit to the University of Bremen. Modern, stylish, comfortable, friendly staff, good breakfast and easy tram ride to city centre
We were visiting Gardaland, ideal place with free Gardaland bus near hotel, Customer Service was great and professional. When booking,  Expedia offered half board unfortunately this was disputed by hotel (not their fault). Expedia did offer to pay back, after complaint so all in all GOOD, although at the particular time not a great feeling. Will make sure I review my invoice next time as the half board did not show on the invoice  but was on the website. Lesson learnt. Very comfortable accommodation in a great location. We found it as nice hotel for family Friendly staff & cooperative Comfortable newly renovated hotel with excellent facilities (including attached good quality restaurant) and good staff. Ideal location (next to railway station, bus stop opposite, 2 mins walk from lake front, 5 mins walk from historic town centre. The only thing average about the hotel was the breakfast. Excellent staff and very comfortable hotel. Would definitely stay there again. The staff was excellent and very helpful and polite. The rooms were very comfortable and the location of the Hotel was perfect. I amply recommend Garden Hotel and I will stay again in this Hotel in my next visit to Peschiera del Garda. This  was the final pat of our holiday and we needed a hotel close to the station ready for our journey home the following day. A helpful receptionist welcomed us and gave us a map of the area highlighting the local beaches etc. Our room was ready for us even though we arrived in the middle of the day. It had everything we needed. We enjoyed our short stay at the Garden Hotel. Beautiful hotel, great price good location. Parking available. One of the most modern hotels we've stayed in on our many visits to Italy. Very comfortable and clean and rooms knitted out to a high standard. The only thing that lets it down is the breakfast buffet which was poor in comparison to other hotels we've stayed in. No hot food - not even a boiled egg, no facility to make toast and no fresh fruit other than some water melon. Location is right across from train station which is convenient and a 10 minute stroll into the town Excellent family suite. Shuttle bus us to theme parks on door step. Fantastic room and great sleep  Breakfast was great and plenty choice. Also the Gardaland bus stops over road. So a free ride into park and Home. Nice hotel and great staff. Bed was a little small but overall would definitely stay here again. Great hotel with high quality accommodation and service We arrived late and still had a nice and friendly staff. The hotel must have been remodeled very recently; thr room was super clean and spacious; the bed very comfortable with a firm mattress; the design typical Italian (fancy and state-of-the-art); the breakfast good and the value overall very much worth the money! We had a very pleasant experience!
Located within a short walk of the rail station and the beach.Within the heart of the town with access to shopping facilities..Hotel set back from the high street in a quiet side road.I have stayed at the Agur on a previous trip and always find the staff very friendly and pleasent to deal with.The rooms themselves are kept well maintained and are very clean although the decor could be described as a little dated.Fantastic value for money as it is only a two star hotel.. I will definitely use the hotel again.the only thing I would say was a negative was the fact that the other guests have a habit of slamming their doors to close them..use the key in it..much quieter The hotel is in the middle of town, so that's excellent. The room was clean and fit for purpose. However, the WIFI was next to useless as it dropped out every few minutes and kept forgetting it's own password. It states free parking, on arrival we were told that there are 3 bays all full...parking around here is hard to find and expensive...not as advertised, but it is right in the middle of town, your choice! I was travelling alone and felt very very safe in Hotel Agur, the staff were very welcoming and pleasant and the Hotel is very central Spotless friendly basic hotel great for a base if you are out and about during the day. Lovely staff would recommend and stay again Basic but good value - great location. Centrally located, friendly staff and nice and quiet,. Good for the price This is a comfortable and centrally located hotel, convenient for the beach and town centre buses and railway. The rooms are very clean. WiFi weak sometimes. Noise from other rooms. Overall good for the price. Lovely and helpful staff. English speaking. Fantastic locality. Nice rooms and facilities. Our 3rd stay there. The hotel was not difficult to find, located just a couple of blocks from the beach and steps from eating establishments. It was very clean and even though it was near a busy street there was no noise at night. I would definitely stay there again because the staff was efficient and friendly.. Book a room with a balcony much bigger. Center of town close to Bus/Train station. only downside beds were uncomfortable Right in the center of town near Bus/Train stations. Nice hotel book a room with balcony (Bigger) only down side uncomfortable beds. reception very helpful very convenient location, fan heater provided as heating not working.Loads of hot water. Staff very pleasant and helpful,  Not a very nice outlook from the window  Could do with an upgrade soon Friendly staff. Great location. Room was nice and conformable.
Really good location. Clean. Comfortable bed I didn't use the amnetities. Staff were friendly. Would come here again! Great location and clean, rooms are modern but the smallest I have ever seen which makes it uncomfortable. 2 people stayed 4 nights in Feb 2018 in a deluxe king room 113 on the first floor. Check in and out was quick. Reception staff (black lady with glasses - sorry I did not catch her name) was friendly and offered advice on nearby facilities and ways around the hotel. Checkout was 11 AM but we were allowed to stay in the room a bit longer without any additional charge because our flight was not until 3 M. Thanks for that. Room is spacious for two, especially when you are out most of the time. Daily room service with free milk, coffee and tea. Clean room. Modern toilet and shower with good hot water. Bath towers, floor mat and only one face towel were provided daily. No hand tower. However it can be supplied if request as told by the receptionist..There is only one hook on the door of the bathroom. That can be easily fixed by providing more hooks on the wall in front of the shower. No free drinking bottle. Air cond. setting was fixed. The only control is turning it ON or OFF. The air vent of the air cond. was blowing cold air right to the bed and we had to turn the air cond. off during the night because it is cold. Free Red CAT bus is right in front of the hotel. It also joins with other free CAT bus services around the city such as Yellow, Blue and Green buses. Elizabeth Quay, Bell Tower, Ferry terminal, Perth station, etc are all within walking distance. Overall it is quite pleasant staying at the hotel in that room. I looked at several hotels before I booked this one. So glad I did. Great location - very near to Perth train station, Red Cat bus stop opposite. Staff extremely helpful and on hand 24 hours. Room clean, bed very comfortable, plenty of hot water from a well powered shower. I chose a petite king room to give us a little more circulation space. If staying more than a couple of nights you might want to consider something larger - although there are comfy chairs in the lobby where you will find newspapers and other publications to browse through. Would definitely recommend to others. I was welcomed warmly at reception and was informed I had a late checkout if I wished and premium wifi. My room, although small ( petit queen ) had all the amenities needed. It was clean and quiet. Location is excellent - free bus across the street - walking distance to malls, supermarkets, art centre etc. I caught the 380 bus from the airport which was a great deal ( $4.70 ) and walked a couple of blocks to the hotel. All staff friendly and courteous. I will be staying again on my return to Perth. super fast checkin .. super nice staff. we had an awesome time the personalised card was a lovely touch & most appreciated rooms very small otherwise all good, have to pay for parking everywhere we travelled and stayed in hotels parking was complimentary as well as the water which we thought too expensive $4. Only thing I have to say, this hotel doesn't seem to be handicapped accessible. Stairs at entrance and step up to bathroom in rooms. That is the only negative thing I have to say about this hotel. It is located close to most things. Walk to Elizabeth Quay is doable and I use a cane. Shopping district is close. Lots of variety of stores. Fantastic location right in the city. Wonderful staff and clean and comfortable rooms. Great hotel in the CBD. Amazing staff allowed for an early morning checkin as my flight landed crazy early from Singapore. Rooms appear to have been recently renovated as they look fresh and up to date. Rooms are on the small side but it’s not like I’m hosting a frat party. We enjoyed our room, and the location was convenient also. Bathroom was small but it had everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. Rooms air-conditioned and clean, no complimentary water, and the lobby is well-presented. great location, reasonably priced. Breakfast options closeby. Had a lovely stay here over Easter. The hotel is in the City and within walking distance of all the attractions. While the room was a little small and perhaps a little dated, it was very clean and bright. The hotel staff were very helpful and nothing was a bother. Perhaps a coffee/snack shop would be nice. The Pensione Hotel Perth is always at the top of my list when booking accomodation for Perth. I enjoyed my night at the Pensione hotel, I will be sure to let friends know about it. Pensione Hotel is in the center of Perth City. It is very convenient to go to all the sightseeing locations. Also, it is close to Hay Street, so shopping, dining and visiting London Court are very easy. I walked 2 blocks to find a #380 bus stop to go to the airport and the road is flat and easy to push heavy luggage. Restaurants and bars are around the hotel but most close early. The Indian restaurant next to the hotel was still open after 10pm. The room was small. I couldn’t even open my 25-inch suitcase in the room and there was no suitcase stand. I was also disappointed that the hotel charged AU$4 per bottle of water in the room because I was visiting Perth in the hot summer. Many hotels provide complimentary water. The room has basic amenities and is clean and tidy. In conclusion, this hotel is suitable for singles/couples with no children and business travellers as well. Ideally situated in the city close to restaurants shops and the bus and train stations Small but clean I stayed here about a year ago. It seems to be undergoing some refurbishment but like last time was clean and comfortable with pleasant staff. It is a bargain for those looking for a decent hotel for a city break. Good value for money hotel in good location for touring area. Great location meeting all my needs , clean suites and efficient staff offering a great service. Tiny room, good location! Awesome stay! Comfortable room, great service from the desk, and close to shopping and restaurants. Would stay again! yes it was good. I cam late night but still felt comfortable. The hotel lobby was refurbished, giving a warm and cozy atmosphere. Hotel is centrally located with good eateries nearby, 5 mins walk to Airport Bus A380 bus stop and Hay Street shopping mall. Double Room was not big but very clean and bed was super comfortable. We love staying at Pensione ! Great central location, helpful staff, comfortable beds, really pleasant room - what more could anyone need for a stay? Great weather helpful staff Great! Very happy with the service, the hotel and the entire stay. The only very minor things I would change would be to have Foxtel in the room to watch footy/cricket when in, and to be able to get a beer when there are no takeaway outlets around at night. Room very clean and comfortable especially the bed. Staff very helpful and friendly especially  be not sure how she spells her name , nothing was too much trouble for her, she was always friendly ,respectful  and is a real assest to your hotel, knows how to treat customers. The only thing we found difficult was breakfast, there was no facility for breakfast except across the road. At miss Maude. We don't eat a big breakfast although we did one morning, there was no plates or cutelery. In our room. We had to buy cereal and fruit, we couldn't have toast. Some hotels have breakfast packs you can purchase and this would have been helpful for us as we stayed for 6 days.the Always a great stay. Wonderful; staying somewhere where the team are always warm, friendly and helpful. Room was serviced daily with clean towels. Rooms smallish but adequate when out all day. Staff were helpful. The hotel was very quiet and the aircon was great with hot weather. Good customer service Good compact deal don't need a big room Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx If you're after just a bed for the night, this is the place. Easy walking distance from many of Perths attractions at a very reasonably price. Limited reasonably priced parking with cozy (small) rooms that are basic but clean and comfortable. Also fairly quiet. My third stay and not disappointed, Very friendly staff. No restaurant but very close to a variety of different options. We had a dinner in the city and decided to stay in the city that night. Hotel was close to everything we needed. Clean and comfortable and the staff where lovely and very helpful Very lovely staff, room smelt unpleasant on arrival, but very comfy bed and nice facilities  and close to the city shops, restaurants and bars Very friendly very clean and great location..This Hotel just keeps getting better Highly recommend. The staff are always smiling and friendly. They make you feel at home as soon as they greet you. The hotel was really clean and the beds are so comfortable. I wanted to pack the bed up and bring it home with me! ! Great retro feel boutique hotel. Super comfy beds, only downsidw is rooms are small. Staff were fantasic & on the plus side they have a guest laundry Very accommodating, close to all city activities. Room was available quickly, located in  a quiet part of the city and easy to find . Staff was very welcoming and the rate was very agreeable. Stayed for 1 night, room recently painted and the fumes were still strong in the room........A/C didn't work.......wifi didn't work Excellent service staff very helpful would stay there again Modern hotel in great location, very helpful staff. Minimal amenities within the Hotel itself but close to everything. Will stay again....... will stay again, great staff, hope they drop the price just a little bit, 10-20$ a night. And hope they open the pub downstairs too. Awesome rooms! ! Nice basic clean room . Helpful staff Met our expectations Nice to be able to get nearby food connected to hotel account, An enjoyable stay and would book here again We are not familiar with Perth and staff very helpful with information , directions etc, we arrived at 12.30 am And had advised reception , the front door was promptly opened, we were  booked in, and off to our room the standard room was small but a perfect size for me travelling solo and had all I needed. Housekeeping are superstars and the room was spotless. Front desk staff are all friendly and helpful, especially Faye who went out of her way to find be a plug for the sink. Great location. Comfortable accommodation. Friendly helpful staff Nice and quiet with very comfortable and clean, updated rooms. Staff was helpful with all questions about parking, restaurants, even looking online for information and providing maps, etc... Easy to walk everywhere, with wifi and computer, if needed. Well located, friendly and helpful staff. My room wasn't big but for one person it's ok.
The hotel is near to Beppu JR station. I have booked a room with 4 western beds. Room is very spacious and comfortable. The room rate is excellent because it comes with buffet dinner and buffet breakfast. The dinner selection is good. My children are happy with french fries, fried chicken etc for buffet dinner since they had enough Japanese food the past few days. The outdoor onsen is quite nice. The only sight seeing we did was to visit the 8 hell of hotsprings. Frankly the 8 hells did not impress me at all. I only find 3 that are nice. I find the entrance ticket quite expensive. If you have a family of 4, take a taxi to the 8 hells. The bus ride is quite some distance especially the way back, almost 45 mins by bus to get back to beppu station and have many stops. Taxi should take about 20mins. The environment is comfortable and staff is friendly.This hotel is convenience that has store and hot spring. beppu is not interesting as I expected. Summer time is a little bit hot for hot spring. The sea water is not good but the sea hell is nice to visit .
The experience at the beach motel was great nice and quiet good spacious rooms If you want basic this is it. So basic. Close to airport. At least it has air conditioning Good basic hotel that is clean, convenient to beach and shops. Easy walk to decent cafes. Had a great time staying at the Beach Motel - the staff were lovely. Only issue we had is that they wouldn't refund our $100 deposit as my daughter split water on the floor. We did get it refunded later that day when they established it was water. So don't spill anything! Overall, a great place to stay with lovely staff. We loved our stay, most of our time at the hotel was spent in the pool/spa. Being on the esplanade we thought it would be noisy with the constant traffic, it was anything but. It was so peaceful and quiet! Definitely would come back! Close to the beach, recently renovated room. Very friendly staff. The pool area was quite spacious with plenty of table and chairs; even a BBQ to use (for a dollar). Good location with a couple restaurants within walking distance a Woolies about a 5minute drive away. Helpful friendly staff. Good clean facilities. Very close to beach. Nice beach motel literally next to beach picnic area. Had everything you need and is clean. hotel just across the road from beach, more of a budget hotel but has all you need I didn’t do my research should have got a ground floor unit with a toaster the restaurant was amazing Great hotel to stay at. We were in the older style room but it was very clean and comfortable. Very friendly staff and fantastic location. We will be back. Beautiful pool! ! Clean and spacious apartment, The bedrooms have been renovated but not the kitchens and bathrooms. Still in average condition though. We would definitely stay here again. Room facilities were good however we had some difficulties in connecting the laptop to the WiFi but thanks to reception staff this was resolved. Internet speed is very slow. Just a night in Hervey Bay. Beach is opposite the Motel. 800mts to the nearest pier lookout, BBQ spots and plenty of seating as you walk along the beach. Motel had everything we needed, was hoping for a washing machine but that was no problem. It was clean and comfortable. I can only say and couple of armchairs would of been more comfortable, a family of 4 to squeeze onto a 2.5 seater sofa was not practical, I ended up seating  on one of the dining chairs which was not comfortable. Walls and ceiling were alittle thin. I could her the music from next door and people upstairs. Great value for money, lovely place, would stay there again! Very good location. Just across the road to a nice sandy beach. Eateries nearby. Pleasant walk along the front in either direction. Nice size pleasant pool. This stay was the last night of our road trip from PD to Brisbane. It’s ok clean , won’t stay there again . Service cleaning lady checking carpets on leaving unnessary not nice . Location for beach great . Tide can be out for the day plan around tide times . Tv from the 90’s  very retro Room is old but has been newly refurbished, clean and comfortable with plenty of room. Will stay again, close to many eating places and the bay The hotel was lovely,just opposite the beach,the room was big and airy,clean,and very reasonably priced,which are the things that I look for when booking.Ok,it’s not 5 Star,but really good value for money.would definitely stay here again. Overall, the room was very comfortable! Only complaint was upon arriving we were informed we needed a $100 bond. I handed staff my card and was advised they would not accept debit card and it needed to be a credit card and I should have known this due to the email sent- which I didn’t receive. We don’t own credit cards. We were told they could take the $100 off the visa debit card but it takes 5 days to clear back into acct, or get cash out. After 7 hours in the car with a newborn and 5 year old this was not pleasing, however, drove out to get cash. Only to come back and be told they don’t open in the morning until 7am and if we wanted to leave earlier, we wouldn’t get our cash back!! as a young family the last thing we were interested in doing is trashing a room!! Having stayed in many places on our road trip, this was the only place that required a bond, and the only place so strict about it!! Very disappointing and because of this we won’t be back. After a 24 hour drive it was an easy place to crash. We were told we had one double bed, one single bed and a couch. No couch...and the shower wasn't the best, but it was a quick and easy place that was affordable for a last minute stay. My friends baby accidentally left his watered down pop top orange juice open and a small amount dripped out. I was charged a $60 cleaning fee in case the 'stain' wouldn't come out. (The 'stain' was just a wet mark after we tried cleaning it up with water to get rid of the smell) I was told this would be refunded if it did come out. I still haven't heard anything from the hotel and I find it hard to believe that a few drops of watered down orange juice would stain a dark THIN carpet. The staff were lovely though, very friendly and directed us towards a cafe down the road which was amazing. (Eat at Dan & Steph's) Unfortunately booked online only room we could get & it was a ‘budget room’ It was awful, so awful we couldn’t stay there. So lost our $’s and found something else. Looked great in online photos but in reality was terrible. The stay here was lovely , room was a little cosy but very clean. It's position is fantastic and bike hire is available with great bike paths for kms on the esplanade. We enjoyed the pool and BBQ area . Great family stay . We stayed for two weeks in a budget room and were very happy. The room was comfortable and the staff are lovely. Will stay there again and would recommend it to my friends. I booked at the last minute and was happy with the deal I got. As far as Motels go it was one of the best I’ve stayed at. for the price, this was a great place to stay. I had a budget room and it was perfect. The only negative is that the fridge was way to small. Good size spa room across the road to the beach, good pool and bbq area Just a very nice motel, spa room is comfortable. Pool and bbq area are perfect for relaxing summer days. Awsome beach just across the road. Have stayed there before and will again. Great location, & great pool were best features. Layout of room was disjointed, fridge at one end, tea & coffee stuff at the other end. Could do with more hanging space in the bathroom, & air conditioner was noisey. Not worthy of more than 3.5 rating for room we were in. A small get away, can't complain and everyone we're accommodating Very clean rooms. Very friendly staff. Great location. Well priced. Excellent location and friendly, helpful staff. The room was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The only fault was the light outside the room was on all night and made sleeping a little difficult. Pool looked beautiful and the surroundings the equal of any five star resort we have been to. We had a budget room and it was great. The money we paid for it we couldn’t ask for more. The stafff were amazing. We will visit again. No hassle booking and staff was great. Room was a bit old but clean and comfortable. Missing aircon remote had to manually turn off or lower the temperature manually, otherwise good. Location was good too. We stayed for one night and drove up from Brisbane, the rooms were very nice and clean. The beach was just across the road. I will be booking a stay here again. Just had one night ....but lovely , staff very good , happy to help in any way . Very clean , comfy bed , everything we needed for our stay . Thankyou Bags of linen were left lying in the corridors, were there when we arrived and still there 3 days later. Staff were pretty rude. Pool facilities were lovely and it’s nice and close to everything. Excellent apart from the internet and very close from beach. Very friendly and helpful staff. Close to shops and the beach.We enjoyed the early morning walk along the waterfront. This hotel is very basic- it was clean but a little dilapidated. Jus don't expect good jus ok.
Got the suit with a jacuzzi that was fun, but the toilet seat was about to fall off, the kleenex box was stuck hanging out of the wall, missing light fixture in the bathroom, and the view was a mud wall and 24hr adult video booth across the street. If they want to charge full price they should maintain the room better, cracked tiles and exposed caulking everywhere felt grimy and they held my $100 deposit for 3 days. I should have took photos I didn't realize it was an option. Good time. Over priced. Not clean feeling due to lack of maintenance not maids Rude front desk, and housekeeping tried to come into our room at 8:40AM without knocking or saying housekeeping. We even had the do not disturb sign up. Very dissapointed. The staff was ok. The hallways and elevator where dirty Excellent room for the money!! Facilities are clean and the guy at the desk was very helpful. You wont find a better room for the price. do not go this place never .... unkind customer service  and very poor breakfast  and etc ... Nothing fancy but was clean and pleasant. Good room for the price! Nice, clean basic motel. On a main road, not too noisy. Street lights and businesses around so not able to leave drapes open for natural light at night, which I like. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Basic, adequate breakfast. Good overall. The room was modern and had everything... coffee, iron and ironing board, wifi. Burn marks on bedding, strong pot smell in lobby and hall. Dirty, old, horrible mattress. People loitering in hall for hours. Front desk had no personality. 9 am and no breakfast. My boyfriend and I booked 2 nights at Days Inn aurora for new years eve as we were in town, we were pleasantly surprised at how nice the hotel was for the price. We had assumed it would be more motel style, but it was very comfortable, clean and a place I would stay in again. The bus stop going downtown is a block away and there is a great Mexican restaurant near by also. Good place and affordable. No hot water, slightly warm only so not able to have a bath. Poor internet connection ~ very slow. Room was clean easy to find lobby. Hotel staff didn't talk to me much when I checked in and when I tried to check out I waited 5 min just for the guy to come realize we were at the desk. When we arrived the room smelled of disinfectant. We left the windows open while we went to dinner and left the bathroom fan on. 3 hours later it was OK. Hotel is located slightly north of Seattle, in Shoreline. Freeways and commuting is convenient and located nearby. Cost efficient instead of staying closer to downtown or where tourist are located. Hotel was quiet and easy accessible. It was great!Staff are approachable.The room was cleaned & more space. Very pleasant. I would recommend and stay here again. staff are nice. Room is decent. When we got onto our floor, there is weed smell in the hallway. People come and go from the hotel seems complication. On the elevator there is warning about people calling rooms for information, so we unplugged the phone. I Should do better research next time. probably not for family. Staff on check in was very rude. He was in a back room when I arrived and finally appeared after 5 minutes. They over charged us and the manager is very rude we come to seattke every weeek for work and will never stay there again!!!!!!!!!! I got some kind of rash from taking a bath there My husband and I stayed at this hotel because my daughters college softball team was playing near by. As soon as we walked through the front door we were greeted with an overly powerful smell of perfume.We were placed in a room right off the front desk sharing a wall with the breakfast room. Traffic sound from the roads and hotel foot traffic made for a noisy stay. Our room like the hotel lobby had a very strong overpowering perfume smell. The TV volume was very low and if the heater and the TV were on at the same time we weren't able to hear the TV. Breakfast is disappointing as well. Room was the best part of the stay. The front desk person at check in and check out did not seem to have a grasp of what was going on or what they were doing. I've stayed here before and had better experiences, so I hope this was an anamoly. Staff at desk were not very welcoming, both in coming and leaving. Check out person hardly looked at me and didn’t say thank you, good morning or have a great day. While the room was comfortable, it had a very noisy refrigerator that made noise all night Clean,  mostly quiet, and decent breakfast,  although there weren't many food options. Overall pretty satisfied Extremely Satisfied, couldn't have been better, and I shall Use the Hotel again if needed  !! 10+++++ The staff was rude and made our stay horrible. A female front desk person made my fiancee stay outside in the snow because he had been drinking and  turned her down. Another guest told on her. Our stay was quite pleasant. The biggest issue was our room was SO warm when we entered and it took several hours for it to cool down to a comfortable sleeping temperature. Great experience. Exactly what we were looking for. Awesome amenities for the price of the room. The room always smelled and refreshing. The employees were courteous and friendly. Wish there was some sort of protein at breakfast. Always stay here. Room was quiet, comfortable and a great location for north Seattle activities I loved how restaurants for food and gas stations n stores were in walking distance. Great location. Great staff and great price It was a simple hotel in Shoreline close enough to just about everything as I had a rental car and drove around. No issues at all and the staff was friendly. Room was nice size and clean. Had table and 2 chairs, plus another cloth chair. Bathroom very large. Only problem was the mattress was not comfortable. But new mattresses were coming in the day we left! Located in a safe neighborhood. Easy access to I 5. Less than an hour to airport. No real complaints. GREAT PLACE FOR THE MONEY STAFF FRIENDLY, THE ROOMS ARE CLEAN PRETTY CLOSE TO ALL. I WOULD COME BACK AND STAY AGAIN FOR TH EPRICE YOU CNA'T GO WRONG. THE STAFF HELPED WITH ALL NEEDS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO REST YOUR HEAD THIS IS IT ! ! Traveled alone. Hardly seen or heard any other guests. Staff were nice. Good location. Loved my stay here Very nice experience. Close to shops and restaurants. Check in Staff was very nice! The staff was friendly and helpful with recommendations for dining. The internet was down when I checked in and the front desk clerk said she would call my room to notify me when it was back up. She followed through diligently. not bad...handy to and from highway or surface streets Nothing negative about this hotel. Good value for the price. Easy access to a number of shops. Quiet neighborhood. 24-7 staff availability. Breakfast included - a plus. Only Really Bad Staff, didn't clean up my room, very rude reception n never wants answer ur phone from room because i check the staff only care about his self, smoking outside, eating, and watching movie (doesn't look work at all) i have to go down to receptions if want to ask anything about the room special staff shift night time always, before the hotel not like this because i use the hotel often. Just this time i got really bad staffs There hallways stunk. The floors were filthy. There was a piece of paper in the hallway I joked let's see how long it sits there. 2 days later it was still there. Taking a shower I looked up and there was what looked like bugers wiped on the wall above the shower head. Looked like they hadn't vacuumed room or halls for weeks Cheapest lodging near Seattle that meets most folks minimum standards. It felt like the hotel management (and the way it was constructed) did the least amount they had to in order to look after the guests' comfort. The walls are thin, really thin. The carpet was filthy, bathroom door had to be lifted up in order to close it. One blanket for the bed (in Winter). I felt safe there, but uncomfortable and restless. I went with a group and stood in two different rooms. Two room keys each, that wouldn't work..got locked out of rooms multiple times. Got an extra two keys for both rooms and those wouldn't even work..ended up finding the original keys and those were the only ones that would work all of the sudden..just bad problems with the room keys.
Excellent location, and clean, well maintained property. Very friendly and polite staff in every department. The morning breakfast is number one in quality with so much variety and excellent service provides a taste of local and international flair. Its central location near a park makes your stay enjoyable without any stress or effort on the part of the residents. The most important aspect is the friendliness of staff who are very fluent in English which is a plus point. The room rates are in the normal range for the excellent service one gets. Impressed by the promptness of response by staff to email questions/inquiries. The experience is typical example of Bulgarian tradition and culture. For a first time visitor to the country we (wife and I)enjoyed our stay at the Hilton the most. We will not hesitate to visit Bulgaria again and stay at the Hilton. Good location to walk to local places of interest. Location has metro (underground ) close by and easy walking access to the city centre and places of historical and cultural interest. The facilities of the hotel enable a relaxing experience with spa facilities available for most of day and night. Nice hotel which is close to city centre, shops and the sights of Sofia. Rooms very spacious and beds comfy. Only gripe was that the shower is not powerful which I would have expected from a 5* hotel. WIFI excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Good location, lovely rooms and mega comfortable beds. The pool was great with a nice terrace so you could sit outside after a dip. Friendly, helpful staff. Really couldn't fault it. Great stay for three nights, welcoming and helpful staff. Stayed here for 4 nights and had an amazing stay as the hotel was beautiful and the staff were helpful and friendly. Would recommend without hesitation. A very nice and well located hotel relatively reasonably priced for the quality Didn't eat in as seemed expensive compared to the rest of sofia - apart from that it was perfect. The location of the hotel is excellent, close to the pedestrian area. A little bit overprised compared to other hotels in Sofia. thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel good. the only downside was that when we arrived there was a conference so all the lobby area was taken up with stands etc. and then on the Sunday there was a wedding and the lobby was full of drinks tables so there was nowhere to sit if you were waiting for transport etc. However, even though there was a conference and a wedding the hotel was very quiet and apart from the disruption in the lobby you would not have noticed. well done. Very good atmosphere and fine hotel. But the swimming pool is little. Warm, welcoming staff. Great views. Very convenient location - very close to the city centre. Clean room. Good spa facilities. Would certainly go back. 10min walk to the Main Street in Sofia. Room and service could not be faulted.
We arrived in Granada by bus and took a taxi form the bus station to the hotel (taxi cost 7 Euros). Bus station is on outskirts so not easily walkable to city centre. We stayed 2 nights in this hotel which is ideally situated in Granada city centre close to the Cathedral and the old town.Lots of bars and restaurants nearby. We visited the Alhambra (we bought tickets before holiday) the Cathedral and Royal Chapel and spent a lot of time walking round the historic areas of Albaicin and Sacromonte, The initial contact with the hotel included pictorial directions to the car park, which was useful, and when our flight was delayed they responded to an e-mail saying it was not a problem and advising the car park was open 24 hours - all very reassuring. Check in was great and we had a room on the 3rd floor with a great outlook off the balcony. The room was spotlessly clean and there was a little welcome tray of sweets and cake for us. We were offered breakfast but we walked out everyday and explored the city, where there were some great cafes doing breakfast at very reasonable rates - we were amazed by the value for money on food and drink all around Granada. Within 5 minutes walk of the hotel were as many Tapas bars as you could ever need. The hotel room had coffee and tea making facilities and a reasonably priced mini-bar. Some reviews talk about the rooms being noisy. The double glazed doors did not silence the external noise but we did not find this a problem; maybe it is quieter in February? We booked a guided tour to the Alhambra ourselves but the tour company picked us up at the hotel and  it was a great experience - the queue for self-guided tours was very long - go early! The car park was 20 euros per day but it was very convenient and we had 3 day trips out around Andalusia - favorite was the Alpajurra with its white villages and one side of the valley totally covered in almond blossom - spectacular for mile after mile. The NH Victoria provide an excellent base! Close to attractions but needs a complete renovation.overall 3 star hotel at its best. Super central location and wonderful staff and facilities. Can’t get any better than this for such an awesome price. Hotel is very central .The hotel had everything and the staff were very friendly and helpful.Nice treat with the sweet selection at reception.Rooms were very clean and comfortable.Bars and restaurants just minutes away. Nice hotel in city center close to shopping area friendly staff clean rooms very rich breakfast We stayed at this hotel during Holy Week and what  a room we had! We literally watched 10 processions from our room, absolutely beautiful! The hotel was in a perfect location and the staff was friendly and very helpful! Would definitely stay there again. Good stay at a well-located hotel in centre of Granada. Hotel is in a historical building in a central location. Comfortable and of good quality. Had a nice little balcony by the square. Great, clean hotel, good location and fantastic helpful staff We had an inside view so very quiet but may have preferred a street view with some traffic noise. The premiumroom was quite basic and very noisy externally making sleep difficult. Reasonable buffet breakfast, restaurant not operating. Good location. We had a great time using this hotel as our base for sightseeing on foot and utilising the tourist train. parking was difficult - we used a nearby underground public carpark for 23 E per day. lots of small supermarkets nearby for supplies and heaps of choices of eateries. Ask the hotel for a city map (not offered) but free and very helpful. The room was high on comfort, with standard amenities expected for hotels of this caliber. The professional staff goes above and beyond expectations for service. Stayed 4 nights. Friendly staff. This is a perfect location for exploring the different neighborhoods of Granada. Lots of shopping and restaurants in the area, which is very walkable. The only reason I give 4 and not 5 is because the area is noisy and from the street view you can hear much of it. Would definitely stay here agin if I returned.
Hotel is up to standards...food is very good...location is excellent to the airport. Meliá Barajas is a beautiful hotel in a prime location. Close to the airport and down the block from some very tasty food spots. The metro is also not a far walk either. The staff was very friendly and the environment is peaceful and clean. Definitely would recommend. All went well! Staff and room were above expectations. Pleasant stay: efficient shuttle service from the airport, tasty breakfast buffet, rooms are big, cleaning service is efficient. Employees could be a bit more friendly however. Can not recommend this hotel. We waited over 30 minutes for their airport shuttle to pick us up and when it finally arrived the driver was extremely rude. The employee at check in was also rude and seemed annoyed by any questions I had. The room was adequate but we were only provided with 1 towel for the 2 guests in the room. There are much better hotel options near the airport than this hotel. Great hotel,very close to Madrid Airport, restaurants nearby and situated in a pleasant area of Barajas suburb of Madrid. Hotel was ideally located for the airport, with a complimentary shuttle. Public areas of the hotel were great and the food in the bar was delicious. Rooms were spacious, albeit a little dated. The only downside was the bathroom - it was so badly designed that the bath stopped you sitting straight on the toilet and you couldn't get in and out of the bath without first moving the shower screen! great location for last day near the airport I booked room convenient for airport as I had an early flight. Everything was fine except I could not sleep because of the noise from what sounded like a Machine/ boiler room above my room. Therefore was a complete waste of money. Excellent option when you lose a flight connection. Close to airport. Food is good. Staff is friendly and willling to help you out. Hotel was very pleasant. Check in process was quick. Had a late bite to eat before retiring( and wait staff was very friendly. Room was clean comfortable and had more amenities than you would usually get in a hotel. (shaving kit, toothbrush and toothpaste as well as the usuals. Free Shuttle bus was very prompt leaving every 15 minutes. Only problem was hair dryer did not work (think there was no power plug) and I let them know when I checked out. They said they would have some go right up to look at it, but I was on my way out so don't know if it was done. I am assuming they did as they were very apologetic. Our first room was awful, but after checking in we were not there long enough to notice. It was small and did not look like any of the photos shown for the property on Travelocity and was located directly over a bar and a set of noisy steps. This room gets a rating of ZERO. When we went to bed the noise became evident. A call to the desk got us a better room, but we were moving our stuff at 11:00 at night. The new room was very nice. I rate it a FOUR. On average, based on our assessment of the 2 rooms, the property gets a rating of TWO. We just spend 1 night but find it very convenience for our early flight out of Barajas! ! Great staff and in the center of a small town, Barajas. Good restaurants and Tapa bars. Perfect for a Madrid stopover. Great nights sleep and convenient shuttle bus services. The place is very nice. Big hotel that feels luxurious. The rooms are not huge, but they were very clean and comfortable. The bed was pretty comfortable, but not the best one I have slept in, but this was not a big deal. The lounge was nice, and the staff at the hotel were all very solicitous. Definitely a very good deal. If I had known about the shuttle to and from the airport that the hotel operates, I would have saved myself 20 Euros in cab fare, but the van ride the next day to the airport was short, on time and pleasant. On our trip on Iberia from Athens to Chicago, we had to layover for one night. The hotel has a free airport shuttle that is easy to locate and runs every fifteen to twenty minutes and a number to call if there is any problem. The beds and bedding were very confortable; the room had a bath and separate shower and included amenities such as a toothbrush /toothpaste, razor/shaving gel and robes; and a restaurant onsite. The breakfast was very good, but the dinner buffet was average. For dinner, I would recommend ordering Ala carte from the menu. We were happy for the restaurant as we arrived late evening, but there is also a McDonalds next door. It was a very  pleasant stay and will now try other Melia hotels. Bait and switch. Although I had with Orbitz a reservation for one double bed room classic, the reception placed us in a poor room with two single beds and one cot. When I told them this was not correct, they upgraded me for an addition cost of ten euros to a classic  room with a double bed. Later that evening,  after I showed the reception desk my Orbitz itinerary with a room picture stating one double bed, they cancelled the extra ten euros. They also were not sure that breakfast was in eluded until I again pointed this included amenity on the Orbitz itinerary. Overall experience poor! We stay here for just one day not to loose our connection to Lima, Peru. The hotel staff is very gentle. Has a free shuttle to the airport and the breakfast buffet is a very reasonable value for money. I totally recommend this hotel for a short stay in Madrid. This hotel was an excellent choice. Very comfortable. The breakfast is the best we had in our trip for different countries. The staff is highly professional, helpful, kind and friendly. Next trip to Madrid we will come back to Melia. Y Surprised by the size of the room, really big. Typical airport hotel. You will not experience Melia. Better off staying somewhere cheaper. The buffet is good. Only found bathtub hard to get in and has poor safety features. High risk for falls This was a very nice hotel. We stayed there the night before our flight out of Madrid. It is close to the airport and has a shuttle to the airport free of charge. It is far from the actual city attractions but if all you want to do is stay at the hotel and your only destination is to and from the airport this is a great hotel. Fabulous hotel staff and room. I highly recommend staying here. Good location, not so many amenities and poor appearance Good hotel to stay for a couple of nights. The hotel is under refurbishment. paid very high price and expected to be a 4-star hotel, but the staff and service likes a one-star motel. hotel itself is outdated, dirty and small. asking for kettle which is a very common equipment in normal hotel but demands to be paid 20 euro which is ridiculous. have car while check in but you have to paid for the temporally park for 4 euro for about 20 minutes, this is a greedy hotel. will never stay there again. Perfect if you're on a connection flight the morning after. Generous sized room, lovely breakfast.
Wifi internet was charged at £7 per night - Excuse me? really! !- not good in this day and age This was a big turn off from my point of view.. Hotel is old may be 1800s built so the lobby is majestic  and remind you off good old times, however the corridors, and elevators need some touching up to do. Room was modern but carpets require a change. as it was looking very outdated. Exhaust fan in the room was not working so after taking shower the room & the shower/ toilet were covered in smog! , cleanliness of the room has  not been exemplary , I would rate it as below average , we could see stain marks on the bath and wash basin , nevertheless it looked like someone has spent time cleaning it, so don't get me wrong on that, staff has been working hard I am sure. We went for a last minute deal so the room price was good for us. Remember the parking is charged in this hotel  & in comparison to nearby parking for full day its better to keep your car in the hotel car park, its much better.- although very few parking spaces for the hotel guests, so please check with hotel if they have spaces before you make your journey We didn't tried the hotel food , so cant comment on that, Lovely place to stay great location right in the centre Pictures online is deceiving and totally different from the room allocated on arrival. Disappointed with the size of the room. Clean and tidy. And very close to transport.alwats stay hete when we goto london We arrived at the train station, where there was an entrance to the hotel. Plenty of places to eat near the hotel, the town centre just on the hotel doorstep. The hotel is a bit dated, but very clean and all the staff are pleasant and helpful. Very good breakfast. Had to change rooms because we booked a club double and were given a standard double. The first room had a strong smell of smoking. Had a room at the front of the hotel but the window was screwed shut and the air con not working, turned heating off and had a fan but still very warm. Breakfast is better quality, cheaper and quicker at the café in the railway station. No water from the taps for duration of the stay. Everything else was as expected. Hotel is great for overnight stay. Perfect location in the railway station itself it is my hotel of choice when in town for rugby league games at KCOM stadium which is only a 20 minute walk away. Sadly  a lovely hotel, great staff but no running cold water! Had a lovely stay at the hotel.staff where very nice and friendly.room was clean and lovely.staff couldn't help you enough. Had a nice stay, room very good, meals reasonable and decent quality The shower had a leak and dripped all night keeping me awake  The bathroom also had black mould on the tiles and silicone and hairs in the plug hole The walls had stains all over them and the room had a fusty smell to it Nice if a little dated. The hotel is right next to the train station which is great if you're travelling by train obviously. Had a pleasent overnight stay. No complaints. Clean, well kept, comfortable and a good price for a city centre hotel. Exactly what we wanted. It’s first time we have stayed at the Royal Hotel in Hull, easy walking distance to the town & marina, lots to see and do Pleasant staff beautiful facade and old building, interior lovely but this only really applirs to downstairs it looks very clean but dated and worn in the bedroom. Very well cleaned but shabby fittings and too minimal very convenient location, parking access, room a bit small but very clean and up to date amenities. definitely value for money Nice hotel well located  paekibf at the train station is 5 pound a day which is good Hotel was perfect for the weekend atop over we needed. I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness of the room and also the layout, as was larger than expected, considering it was a club room. I had a great nights sleep in the very comfortable bed. The food in the restaurant was good and reasonably priced, with quick service. The only aspect of my trip, which completely spoilt it was, that even though I had paid £7 for 24 hours for Wifi in my room, I could not use it, as it did not work. I complained to the Hotel and they advised me to call Virgin, which I did and spent most of the evening on the phone to them (you have to wait for them to call you back) the matter was not resolved and I ended up doing my work in the bar until 1am. If I was on business again, I would not stay here, unless I had the guarantee of Wifi in the room. A big thank you to the night reception staff, who gave me an extension lead to use. The room I had was backed onto the train station kept wake by the trains and announcer having to pay for WiFi is a joke it should be built into the room rate like the car parking should be to Room was a bit ‘tired’, bathroom especially with shower hanging loose from the wall. In room Wi-fi = 2x20 mins free, chargeable thereafter. Free in bar and restaurant though; not good. Car parking was convenient but this seemingly only advantage over local competition. I was very unimpressed with this hotel. The lifts were out of order, an extra charge for parking and my room overlooked platform 5 of Hull station. I won’t be returning. Good Location Friendly Staff Moved room twice due the 1st room being cold and the air being out of order. The 2nd room was at the top of the building and due to the wind the window rattled. Final too. Was looking in towards the small square and was nice without any noise and the heating Wish Mercury still owned this hotel. You were at least asked if you’d enjoyed your stay. The staff don’t seem bothered now. Hotel looking tatty and unloved. Great location, shame no hot water for a shower in the morning The cold tap in the washbasin did not work Very good breakfast/excellent service in breakfast room.Good cup of tea. Handy situation for shopping/transport Reception staff lack common sense and understanding when I needed help. There were hairs in my bed. The rooms are really noisy. It's a shame as the building is pretty amazing and the location is pretty good for Hull. Stay was fine except I was put in a new room which was in the basement and had no windows. Good facilities. However I felt claustrophobic. Felt like I was in a cell! Nice clean hotel right in the centre of town perfect for a night on the town or to see a show ,perfect for train or public transport I would defernately stay again . Great location Really enjoyed the overnight stay. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was great. Hotel location couldn't have been better for exploring the centre of the city. Would definitely stay here again. Hotel is quite dated. Rooms are extremely small. Hotel staff members were helpful. The rooms were kept uncomfortably hot. Even with windows open it was unbearable. Nice easy check in, was given a free room upgrade to Executive room, nice large clean room with tea/coffee making facilities. Great night out drinking in the Old Town, then back to the Hotel for a good nights sleep, only to be woke up by Humberside Police using sirens about 4am in the morning. Totally uncalled for, in South Yorkshire they are banned until 7am, but otherwise nice stay.
I needed a short overnight stay to avoid driving to from work in bad weather-1 night. Room was comfortable, bed good, lighting good, restaurant food good-staff very good. But I thought 135.00 for a night in the middle of winter for a room that although pretty clean-definitely could use painting and sprucing up - was a bit pricey for this level of hotel (3 star). With taxes 150 - so - I didn't really want to spend that much considering the purpose. We arrived late and called for the shuttle when we had our bags. We were told 15 min. We waited in the cold for 30 before calling back again and asking where it was. We were told it would be fine and it would be there in 10. The drive from the airport is 8 min long. Which means we were forgotten about. The driver didn't say anything when he finally arrived, no greeting and no apology. Nor did he help us with our bags or communicate to us that after our 40 min wait that he needed to loop around again to pick up someone else who just arrived adding another 10 min. When we finally arrived at the hotel, they did apologize and gave us a free breakfast for the morning which we appreciated. The room however was not a king like we had booked and the heat was on full blast. It was so hot there was condensation on the windows but since we only had 5 hours left to sleep before returning for our connecting flight we turned on the air conditioning and did our best to sleep. The morning shuttle driver was great, friendly and helped me with my bags. Room was very clean ! The Resturant was very good and fare prices . Staff was amazing .The only thing we were disappointed in was the POOL :( it needs to be all redone , the pools walls and floor was stained green. Got tub not working , the walls all peeling, ceiling was nasty just not a peeling at all. Didn't even stay, left and went to another hotel. There was splatter on the wall near the bed that appeared to be blood, sheets looked gray and unwashed and there were bugs in the room. This room was meant to be just a day stay for our daughter due to a late flight. It was so bad that she didn't even stay for the day. Very nice and clean . My kids love it. My kids are very picky for cleanliness and they love this place. Add said free parking. Had to pay extrafor parking......? Staff was rude and unhelpful -- basically told me that they wouldn't book the shuttle to airport for the time I wanted ... had to demand it. On top of it all -- they charged my credit card for the room even though it had been pre-paid through Expedia. Very hot in room upon arrival. Had to sleep with air conditioning on. Friendly staff at reception desk and cleaning. Shuttle was slow to pick me at airport, one hour wait but on time from hotel to airport. People seem to love this place for its service and more. I would definitely go back. They r gud. Clean hotel clean  room. Most important thing. Room beds. Comfortable. I like the pillows. Check in was awesome. Room was clean and well appointed. Once we figured out that we should turn the heat off rather than just lower the temp we were much more comfortable.Room was clean and beds comfortable. Nice and clean...close to the woodbine mall and Casino. We enjoyed our stay. The most impressive is the airport shuttle ride. The front staff were efficient, friendly and helpful except one that looked and behaved as if she would rather be somewhere else! It's close to the airport, shopping malls and restaurants. It was a good value for our money. I will definitely recommend this hotel and book it again in the future... Stay was pleasant. Close shopping and casino. Extra coffee was provided upon request. Warm. Beds were comfortable. Fridge was a bonus. Friendly reception at check in. Had newly renovated room, which was most pleasant and well equipped.. Enjoyed an on demand movie, still playing at theatres. Looks pretty old, and have strange smell. Pot deco. The hotel handled all our needs to and from our destination without any problems. The room was filthy when we checked in, left over garbage from the previous guests (I'm assuming) and then in the middle of the night our toilet flooded the entire bathroom causing us to have to switch rooms. When we called the front desk, someone came up and said yep it's flooded and then we waited in the room. No one came back, so we called again then went downstairs for us to be handed a key and told go and check out this room, see if it's ok and then come back which we did. The second room was fine but when I told all of this to the front desk upon checking out the next morning, nothing was offered to me except for an I'm sorry. Most times if this happens you're offered maybe a coupon for breakfast or maybe even some money off of your bill but...nope...nothing. I would never stay here again! Bed was a litll worn but ok better info re. shuttle pickups such as times and pickup post nos. Overall very good Hotel! No real issues to note. We went there based on the fact there was a pool. Unfortunately it had been closed by the city health department. There was also an issue with our pass keys not working in our door but managaement did fix that quickly by moving us to another room. Not saying this isnt a good place to stay but our first experience was less than desireable. Nothing fancy here but it does have a Kernig for coffee machine which makes my hot water and coffee clean and safe. I walked in there and there are 2 big flying bugs on the window. Everything else is ok. An hour ride to the city totally do not worth staying with the room just ok. Unfortunately we could not get 3 weeks parking with our stay, had to park somewhere else. I would have certainly paid at the hotel what I paid to park elsewhere. Something to consider. The hotel is looking a little scruffy, needs some minor improvements. Overall very convienent and the staff are very helpful and courteous. Nice clean room and looked like it was recently renovated. Very comfortable bed. Free parking. Quick check in and friendly staff. You wont go wrong booking a room at this hotel. Close to racetrack/casino. On the last night of my stay ,I fell outside and hurt myself.I leave a message for the GM.Hope he will return my call.Apart from my keys was not working had to keep going to the front deskl.Over all the my time there was ok. We were very disappointed that you would not have mentioned the pool was out of service we really wanted our son to be able to go for a swim and we pick this hotel because it had a pool Second time here. Ideal location to airport. We had problem with room card and ended up changing room because of faulty lock on door. Staff at desk very friendly. We had Rajhit(?) before and were very pleased. They have free coffee bar. Didn't have time for the pool so can't comment on it. A little disappointed no microwave or fridge but guess stay not long enough to use. Didn't check pricing of hotels in the area so cannot comment on that. There are a few restaurants in the area and of course a coffee shop (Tim Horton's). Will definitely stay again. Nice simple hotel close to shopping centre, food place etc. For those who have to stay nearby the airport, this hotel is very good for the money. It was horrible. Clearly construction going on, but it seemed like no one had vacuumed in weeks. First room they put me in had dirty sheets, as in, a bed re made without cleaning the sheets. The floor was covered with dirt and detritus and the bathroom straight dirty. The second room was a “renovated” room, still dirty, the bathroom in the second room was even worse and the ac unit didn’t work, so I was freezing all night.
We arrived just before Christmas, so it was busy, busy. Check in was personable, efficient and professional. Concierge is extremely useful and helpful. We used the restaurant in the adjoining building - a good way to start the day. Our room had a fine view of....nothing in particular - just the central empty roof space in the middle of the hotel. The room was dominated by the very high and comfy bed. Noise - the hotel walls and ceiling have a life of their own. The plumbing and, I assume, air con, rattled, wheezed and gasped in chorus with the minibar fridge. Be warned if you're after a quiet retreat. Despite the cacophony it was a comfy stay, and we would have booked again on our return to the city had it not been booked out. The Argonaut is a nice hotel right by the water close to tons of restaurants, shopping, parks and cable car stops. The staff were super friendly and helpful and I recommend using the concierge to help book restaurants and outings. Rooms are very nice and spacious, a bit of noise between the rooms especially through the doors that connect rooms, and we had two on each side. Otherwise, very comfortable and clean. The Mermaid restaurant is very good, especially for breakfast and reasonably priced. Overall, a great hotel and easy location to get around San Fran, away from the busy crowds of Union Square area. My son and I really enjoyed the look and location of this hotel, staying 6 nights. It's beautifully decorated, clean, and quiet. Excellent concierges, though one was rather pushy and we ended up spending more than necessary for the attractions because of that. The $25 + Tax/day resort fee seems rather greedy. The hotel is not a resort by any means and the in-room coffee & exercise room are pretty standard even in 3-star hotels. Many even provide tea as an alternative (for kids, for example), which this hotel does not. There is an unusually large selection of drinks and snacks provided in the room for sale at the normally inflated hotel prices; the fridge was completely filled up with them, in addition to a large tray. I would have preferred not to have to relocate them in order to be able to use the fridge for our needs. The hotel restaurant is OK far from amazing; the menu is rather limited and it's expensive, even with the small discount included in the resort fee. There is a lot of food available nearby, though. Overall very good stay. Hotel is situated in a very populated part of town with scenic views everywhere you look. Walking distance to beach, restaurant, all the piers, and cable cars. The hotel is meticulously decorated with a Nautical theme and features authentic wood beams throughout every room, highlighting the original intent of the building. With that being said, since the building was not built for a hotel, it does have some issues. Since central Heating and cooling might not have been in mind when the building was created, the duct work and interior A/C units are located wherever it was possible to place them. This was apparent in each of the four rooms the (wonderful) staff tried to place us in. Each louder than the other. It sounded like your room was about to lift off into space. If you're annoyed by noise like myself, don't stay here; otherwise, it was perfect. Also, if you book with expedia, they will charge you a $25+tax per day resort fee... I missed this detail when booking and was pleasantly surprised upon check-in. Lovely hotel and a lovely sympathetic conversion of a historic building. Well located for Fisherman's Wharf and Hyde Street Cable Car turnaround for access to downtown San Francisco. Upgraded to a suite and was very impressed. Wonderful deep jacuzzi bath and separate shower. Lots of room in the separate sitting and dining area. Although clean there were areas where cleaning could have been improved but that is being picky. Did not like the stocked 'Honour' bar that left no room for you to use for your own drinks. Also got charged for something we never had but only found out after departure. I also requested a room on the highest possible floor which would have been 4 but got the lowest possible which was 2! Super Hotel in awesome location! Rooms are very clean and they are nicely decorated. They don't look like a steril hotel rooms. Staff is very friendly and helpful! Great location. Clean hotel and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend! ! Came for Spring Break with my kids 13 and 1. Located close to everything! The staff was very friendly. The place was clean and the decor was pretty cool. I'm glad that we chose this hotel. Very convenient to many attractions. The beds were very comfortable but were difficult to get into because they were high off the ground. A small step would have helped tremendously! Great location! You can walk or ride the trolly to almost every attraction along the pier. Only drawback is the thin inside walls. It was like our neighbors were in our room with us. Very nice location.nothing was too much effort for the staff .we had a couple of minor problems .but was delt with immediately and with a smile and apology we had great stay. close to  everything and a smaller in a good way hotel. great staff. we would definitely  stay again or recommend  to friends. Wonderful boutique hotel with great location close to bay and near a nice walkway that winds towards the bridge. The hotel is conveniently located near the fisherman's wharf. The rooms are clean and charming. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. Parking is rather expensive, but I guess that's San Francisco. Have stayed here before and decided to give it another try. The room felt dark and cold. The walls were exposed brick and the room was long, which probably hindered the room from being fully heated. If you enjoy this type of style --fine. Next year, I will return to the cozy Marriott rooms up the block. On a positive note -- the breakfast in the Blue Mermaid was excellent! Fantastic hotel. Great location if you wish to stay on fisherman’s wharf. Great views over to Alcatraz and the bridge from our room on the 4th floor. Rooms nicely appointed with coffee making facilities. Alternative there is a Starbucks walking distance 2 mins away. ....  Great cafe round the corner too called “bueno vista” What a fab themed hotel and amazing bed for a great sleep We had a pleasant stay at the hotel with our young son. We had hoped to rely on the concierge for help planning our days but she was busy for up to half an hour at a time and didn’t break ever from her guests to say, “do you need a quick recommendation or directions...”. At one point it sounded like they were just gabbing about personal experiences while we just wanted a quick dinner recommendation and she wouldn’t even glance our way as we waited. The room was fine. Location is good if you are looking to hit the touristy spots on the wharf. Next time we plan to stay in a more central part of town that isn’t so touristy. So we don’t spend so much on Uber’s getting away from enormous lines at in and out burger and Krispy Kreme and can get to Chinatown or union square easily. Great staff, clean I love this hotel - great staff, easy location, clean and a 'just right size'. Took advantage of the free bike rental on my last visit which was a perk. I usually stay union square for business but the argonaut was a terrific find in fisherman’s wharf. Super quiet rooms and comfortable beds in a great location. Just perfect ! Super stay. Thinking of staying again for a night next month when I pass through SF. Hotel is lovely with a nautical theme, friendly, helpful staff, a great location and a great restaurant. The parking is $75 per day though which was a bit of a shock The room is clean, decent and the location is perfect. Great location and great staff. Minor problems with electrical appliances did not overcome other virtues. We (my wife and I) will certainly consider staying there again. The rooms were clean and large, in the lobby there was lots of games to play with family. Breakfast in the hotel was okay and fast but not great hotel is situated in a perfect location. Cable car just a minute round the corner, a must for a visit to the hilly streets of san francisco! Hotel is steps away from everything on Fisherman's Wharf. Hotel very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was ok - food arrived quite cold and took ages. Plenty of eateries nearby. Very clean, and the staff was very accommodating....and fantastic location! We had a fabulous stay at the Argonaut Hotel on our recent visit to San Francisco. It is located right in Fisherman's Wharf with quick access to Ghirardelli Square and the cable cars plus all the excitement of the Wharf. It was beautifully decorated and very clean. Although it is right in the middle of all the action, noise was never a problem. The staff was amazing. Josh greeted us at our car and made sure we got checked in good and brought our luggage up. He made sure to find out where we were from and ask us about our home state of Alabama. Levon who works the desk went out of her way to help me print e-tickets for our bus tours which was not part of her job but she wanted to help and could tell that neither of us were very tech savvy. We have already been recommending the hotel to all our friends. It was a great experience! ! This was my second time staying at the argonaut and I am never disappointed. The rooms are beautiful, clean and nicely decorated. Housekeeping is excellent! All staff are courteous and well trained..eager to make your stay the best it can be. They have a very knowledgable concierge who will help you get the most out of your stay in San Francisco. I just recommended the argonaut to someone else going to San Francisco. It deserves a five star rating! When we arrived at the hotel we were immediately greeted by a uniformed employee who asked if we needed help with our baggage. The front desk personnel were excellent and accommodated our request. The concierge were so friendly and helped us by booking up our tours, dinner reservations etc. They kept us informed constantly. The rooms were excellent and very comfy. The room was always kept clean and stocked properly with the shampoo, soap and especially the Kleenex box always maintained. More than enough towels compared to other hotels. I hate to call for more towels and other items, which should have been stocked properly. The hotel is right at the board walk with the docks right there, but was very quiet. I was surprised how clean the board walk had been kept up. I liked the idea of the police walking their beat on the board walk. I felt quite safe. I would difinately go back to this hotel with no hesitation. Every aspect of this hotel is charming from top to bottom. The hotel lobby is gorgeously decorated in nautical themes, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and the room was large, beautifully accented in more nautical decor, and extremely clean. the location is prime in Fisherman's Wharf and right next to a shop to rent bikes to tour the city or ride across the Golden Gate Bridge (which we did!). The hotel bar is so nice with delicious happy hour food and drink specials every night. It was a great stop for a quick bite after our long days of touristy fun. When we return to San Fran we will surely stay here again. Hotel was within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and all waterfront activities. Cable cars were literally next door. I won't stay anywhere else in San Fran! Would stay there again. Staff was friendly and helpful. Convenient location put us within walking distance of restaurants and activities on fisherman's wharf. Room was very clean and bed was comfortable. Highly recommend. We loved this hotel and would definitely stay again! The location was perfect, as we walked along the wharf many times. Also convenient to grabbing a trolley. Great restaurants nearby and also at the hotel we had a wonderful breakfast at the Blue Mermaid cafe. The free bikes were a fun benefit and riding across the Golden Gate Bridge was absolutely fantastic. Traditional trip to San Francisco for lunch started 30 plus years ago. Love the city and will be back soon! Wonderful hotel in a perfect location. Friendly, great and exceptionally knowledgeable staff. We would definitely stay here again. Best spot for holidays in Fisherman's Wharf IMHO, right next to cable car start station, easy walk everywhere. The only slight blemish on the hotel's performance was the quality of the connection at the business center - slow ponderous internet access at immense cost. Other than that - perfect. I really wanted a hotel away from the city center and homelessness problem. The Argonaut could not be in a better location. It is central to everything and right near a lovely beach. Great walks in every direction. Hotel room was excellent even though I only had a courtyard view, but this didn't bother me. Bed was super comfortable. Lobby amenity was terrific and hotel food very good. Staff super friendly and helpful. I can be a bit of a princess when it comes to hotel rooms but this one passed the test! Situated right in the heart of fisherman’s wharf great staff and let us in early when we arrived This was a great hotel, wonderful location. We arrived early and the hotel staff happily let us into an available room. Would highly recommend Found the bed a little uncomfortable. Great staff and friendly. Great hotel in a great location Mermaid bar provides excellent fresh food Amazing location right on Fisherman's Wharf. Cable car located right next to the hotel and of course the great location and restaurants along the Wharf area. The staff and ambience of the hotel were first class and would highly recommend this hotel. Some of the front office staff were rude and argumentative with me for absolutely no fault of mine. I guess they can be arrogant since it is a popular destination and they don't really care about customers. Pros 1] Close to Fisherman's wharf. Cons 1] Extremely expensive hotel - upwards of $250 a night and on top of that you have to pay a ridiculous resort fee of $100 and also they force valet parking(approximately 50 to 60 bucks a night) on you although they don't really have a dedicated spot and just park in the lot behind the hotel. You could also directly park there and pay a lot less. 2] The inside of the hotel is really tiny and the windows don't open to the bay like in the photos. The view is pretty terrible and you will end up never actually opening the shades. 3] The restroom with the attached bath doesn't have a vent fan. So it will get pretty smelly fast and the smell will linger on for a while. 4] Breakfast is not free either. 5] The bed is made of a thick material and set pretty high up. Couldn't fall asleep on it. Overall, this is a very nice place with excellent staff and nice rooms. All staff from the valet to the maids and everyone in between are superior. They don't mind assisting with anything and always are super nice. The rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable. I love the buttons by the door that are for privacy or to clean the room. So much better than a paper sign. I did not like that the bathroom did not have a switch for air flow- odor....we are humans. The hotel does have thin walls so keep that in mind. Would stay here again if I ever went back to SF. This hotel made me happy! It is really charming, and the staff was really nice and helpful. If you walk to the left, you can get to nature. If you walk to the right, you get to the touristy piers of Fisherman’s Warf. It’s also far enough at one end that it wasn’t overrun with people once the weekend hit. I was also right next to the cable car stop, so it was easy to get to when we came back from going into the city. I would happily stay here again! The hotel is small but super good situation you can walk and can take any transportation from there. Hotel was very nice. Cordial help and beautiful rooms. Really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is close to the wharf and restaurants and shops. Cable car station is just around the corner. The building in itself is a historical landmark, beautifully transformed to a hotel. Nice clean rooms treat your self with a wiew of the bay. Professional and friendly staff and a very good restaurant. I can recomend this hotel to anybody going to SF. Donavan was a GREAT member of your staff. Everyone was very helpful. Centrally located, great hotel rooms and staff. No complaints . We would stay again The hotel had nice decor, it was clean and the staff, friendly and helpful. The staff was great. They were very friendly and helpful throughout my stay We had a great stay. The room was clean. The staff were all helpful and friendly. The location is great. Great home base to see SF. We had easy access to the water and the cable cars, so easy to get around. Close to in town beach and great running in the mornings. Staff were very friendly. We had an excellent stay. It is well located, I was able to jogging to the Golden Gate Bridge, the staff was very helpful & I would definitely go again. Hotel is very convenient to all the sights and you would be hard pressed to find a friendlier staff. We would definitely stay here again! Had a rental car and cancelled it since this hotel is in the perfect location. Would stay here again. Such a cute hotel with great amenities and great staff! Very clean, quiet and a fantastic location! Perfect location to get anywhere, anytime in the city. Safe, convenient, creative, and comfortable. Great for families. Park at the hotel and then forget about your car. Connect with the concierge regarding trolly, rail, and hop on/off tour buses that make all the difference. Staff was wonderful. The entire experience was so much better than a large but faceless hotel or a cheap and unsatisfying location. Don’t hesitate on this one. We had a great stay, exceptional location! Friendly and warm staff We had a great time, the location is great. The valet parking rate of $85 is a bit steep but the staff was very friendly. Hotel was in the perfect location. The lobby smells like fresh chocolate chip cookies ALL THE TIME. Beds and pillows were dreamy. Nice size room. Nice staff. The only bad thing in the hotel was the restaurant. Waiters and hosts are horrible, minus the girl bar tender. The room was spacious for a city hotel. The location was perfect being just away from Fishermans Wharf but easy walking and we were located right by a cable car. The staff were friendly and we loved the fact they welcomed pets at the hotel ( even though our dog was in England!) They was even a bottle of the wine in the room for when we arrived.
Hotel Makar has excellent service, very good position in quite and green part of Pecs and superb fitness facilities. Stay in standard room - very dated, however cheap price. Good economy hotel on the outskirts of the town centre (20/25 min walk - or 2 mins taxi ride with the local lunatic cabbie) Courtyard garden for relaxing, but two chairs to cater for it, and the most uncomfortable bench seating. Room was comfortable and clean. There was an extra charge to park the car there that wasn't listed on the website. It wasn't much just a surprise. Some of the spa features weren't working but the pool was great. It was a great value especially if you can use the sports facilities.
Nothing much, just a stay-over night while waiting for my visa to be processed yet I don't want to disturb a friend Good & Smoke free  The only problem is its not a queen size bed. Not too comfortable to sleep at night. We are couples. Not singles. So it was 2 single beds join together. We can feel the middle portion. Not a good room for couples The hotel itself was pleasant; nice friendly staff and clean rooms (it was rather small sized though). However the neighbourhood was quite intimidating at night as it is the red light district and there were a lot of men lingering around the streets directly staring as I walked past. Also the hotel was quite far from the MRT station (3 stations via bus) but the bus stops were nearby which led to many main attraction sites I have stayed before with the Hotel 81 group & find them good value for hotels as my trip was just a transfer  & Ground transport  from Channi is reasonable . The hotels are not far from Airport & yet Singapore is still reachable . I would recommend this hotel again as its got all you need for a night stop over Rude staff. Never gave me a refund after I told them I am not staying here. In the middle of a red light district, bad old hotel outdated and dirty Located in red light district,used by local sex workers.All taxi drivers,told us it was a dreadful hotel. Rooms are small and dated and Stink like stale cigarettes in rooms. Pretty good. Prefer a thicker blanket. Cause it was raining heavily on that day. its a good budget hotel. near to shops and cheap food outlets. Easy checking in and out. Clean and good wifi in our room. It had all it needed and we had a comfortable stay. Small & congested room & wash room. I left the hotel after 1 night. small room with unfriendly staff Pillow is too flat and My neck ache next day. The TV is way to small and was mounted on the left side of the wall. Therefore we couldn't enjoy the entertainment from the TV. Nice mid-range hotel located among many other hotels. Very convenient (2 short blocks) to main street with many restaurants, mini marts, 24 hour grocery and money exchange. Very quiet hotel, despite being so close to a major roadway. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Printed out onward itinerary and reservations without charge or acting put upon. Excellent value for the money. We are planning on staying here again on a return trip in March. room had no window, only one bottled water supplied, no tissue box It was nice and easy.but this is not a family hotel. Lobby counter staff Gordon is friendly and good attitude. Front staff are very rude . Rooms are tiny , will develop neck pain as you have to watch tv in sleeping mode only  No seperate shower space Small , clean, but Aircon too noisy , also outside too noisy
You wont find anything better for this price. The view from balcony and especially from the rooftop (which is open 24 hours) is AMAZING. The room is just enough size. The location is great - 7 minute walk to city center (shipping area etc), and literally 3 minute walk to acropolis entrance. Only minus is that the shower space is TINY - smallest I've ever seen in my life. It's difficult for an adult to take a shower and wash oneself. its extremely small and uncomfortable. The Acropolis View is true to its name in that from the large rooftop you have a panoramic view of the city and Acropolis. The rooftop is accessible 24/7 and has many tables and chairs. The facility is probably around 40 years old and shows signs of wear but is made well --marble staircase, high ceilings, decorative light fixtures  --and in good shape. The front staff are very accommodating; they will make you a cocktail or latte at anytime, book your tours, and watch over your belongings while you enjoy Athens on your final day. Excellent value for money, perfect location, wide breakfast selection, elevator, safe in room, water always very hot. Great view of Acropolis from the balcony rooms especially at night. Christopher on reception was full of good information about what to do, where to go etc. Everybody so friendly. Two experienced taxi drivers did not know where it was but both used GPS to find it so make sure you check out where it is on the map before you leave home (I had it loaded on my iPhone). Fixed price taxi from airport so it does not matter if the taxi driver has to drive around to find hotel. Bathroom small. Shower in bathroom very small. Toiletries provided. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to friends. Excellent location, within walking distance of all the sites we wanted to visit. The hotel was very clean, staff were helpful, breakfast was plentiful, location was perfect! Nice, small hotel close to the Acropolis and to where all the city's tour buses intersect. Great view of the Acropolis from the roof top. Rooms are meant for sleeping, not relaxing, presuming that almost all awake time is spent out of the room. Rooms were clean, just small and not meant for lounging. Staff were extremely helpful. Breakfast was fine for bread, cheese and coffee. Some whole fruit and cold cereal as well. Up the hill to the Acropolis! Very decent place and clean BEST VIEW IN ATHENS -  Acropolis Complex could be seen from our balcony & from rooftop terrace. GREAT STAFF GREAT LOCATION-  very short walk to Acropolis complex (> 2 blocks), lots of excellent restaurants and shops. This wonderful hotel is located in the ancient Athens centre, i.e. the Acropolis. The staff is very helpful and amicable, and the hotel is very clean. Wonderful view of the Acropolis from the terrace and the hotel is at walkable distance from 95% of the main attractions in Athens. Definitely recommend! The hotel provides a great value for money - the facilities, staff service, etc. The location is amazing, allowing to experience Athen's most important and interesting places by walk. This is the perfect place to stay if you want to be close to the Acropolis, Plaka etc. It is a small, basic hotel but it is very comfortable and clean and the staff is extremely helpful with directions, recommendations for eating out and in general. This hotel is very reasonably priced so don't expect luxury but one cannot ask for better location and service. They gave us our breakfast 45 minutes early so we could get to the airport. We got stuck in the lift but still love the place (they got us out quickly and it was fixed in a public holiday) The view from the roof fantastic Hotel has fantastic rooftop view of the Acropolis and there are restaurants close by. Also about 10 mins walk to Metro. Good value and staff were helpful. Great location to walk to the Acropolis, shopping and delicious late night dining. The staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this hotel! Great location, breakfast, room, and amenities. The concierge was very helpful. The one thing that sealed the deal was the view of the Acropolis. This was a good trip. Hotel is nice. We had trouble locating it and it is a little crowded around that area but so close (walking distance) to a pedestrian walk way, the Acropolis Museum, and the Parthenon oh and the Metro. Weather was great in November...a sunny 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Staff at hotel was helpful and gabe us recommendation for restaurants. Amazing! Loved the view from rooftop terrace of the Acropolos! Wonderful location! Stayed 2 nights. Very conveniently located near tourist attractions. Hotel staff very pleasant & obliging. Good breakfast  & comfortable room. Great location for the best Athens has to offer! Quiet, dispite being in the heart of things and very helpful staff. Good value for it's location. Very Happy with our stay. Lovely affordable hotel with good service. Awesome place. Very centralized location. Friendly and helpful staff.
Staff are helpful, breakfast was good, lots of Russian options to try like blintzes. Nice decor in the hotel, rooms are quite large, bathroom was clean. Friendly staff spoke good English. We ended up staying there more days than we planned. They knew the AC wasn't working. One day was in the 90s. They sent a repairman, but he didn't fix it. The window open worked but there were no screens, so the mosquitos were bad. I was there a week. I wish they'd changed me to a room with functioning AC.
Wonderful, hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. Didn't get a chance to try the breakfast (had to leave early in the morning) but the facilities looked wonderful. Everything was clean. Great room with a great location (and staff) - shower a smidge small but not a deal breaker :) Overall it was an outstanding hotel. Wonderful time. We enjoyed the central location, though were disturbed on both nights by rather loud conversations being held in the street outside. The bathroom was a little cramped. Interesting artwork on the walls. Excellent staff, extremely friendly and hospitable. We had an issue with the AC leaking but they were extremely helpful and prompt and compensated us for the inconvenience. All in all, a very pleasant stay and experience. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a central spot in the middle of all the action Small room, but very comfortable. Lovely staff. Nice breakfast. Nice location, near the University. Very central and great walking distance of the university and main museums. The room was basic but definitely worth the money. Staff were a little abrupt and I had to move rooms unexpectedly which made me late for the conference I was speaking at. Although I was thanked for complying, this was a considerable inconvenience and there was no concession made for this. Super economy in terms of the room: bare bones accommodations in a graffiti-overrun part of town. The room was clean and had no bedbugs. Super scratchy bedsheets with a coarse weave, so long sleeves helped prevent feeling itchy. We stayed in mid-June, and the room was extremely hot. We did not realize we even had AC the first night. With the AC on it made no difference. Also, there is a lot of street noise (people partying) until 2AM, so earplugs were necessary. Breakfast was uninspired, so we stopped heading down for it. Wifi is spotty and did not work in most parts of the room, so try sitting in the hallway or head downstairs, if you really need it. For the price, it's clean and functional, but not particularly comfortable. Great for college kids and those on a tight budget, perhaps. That said, all of the staff at the front desk was extremely kind, helpful, and made concerted efforts to make everyone's stays very pleasant. All of them deserve excellent marks!
Firstly St.Augustine is a must visit and I would definitely recommend taking a hop-on-hop-off Trolley tour to get familiar with the area. Apart from the historic value of the town, the quantity and quality of the food outlets is amazing and excellently priced. I would also recommend taking a tour of the island and visiting the Alligator Farm as it was definitely not what I was expecting. Also worth visiting is the Fountain of Youth area --- not for the fountain, but for everything else. If you need public transport to get around the area (as my wife and I did), I would recommend trying Uber rather than the local taxis service --- although quite pleasant drivers, the vehicles left MUCH to be desired --- one I took had the front bumper bar partly hanging off and I think that the rear one could have been taped up, while the interior was quite dirty --- BUT the driver was great. It would be best to visit the area during the week as it gets VERY busy at weekends. This hotel is on the bayfront and one block from the historic part of St Augustine. It is easy to walk to the fort and many attractions. This is the best thing about the hotel. The staff is terrible- they are unfriendly at best. Never say hello, good morning , etc. That in itself would be ok, because of the location, but the room was dirty. It was not serviced at all one day, and the next we were given towels and the beds were made, but that is all. The room had not been swept at all. The 'clean' floor still had trash on it and your feet turned black when walking on it. We cleaned the room ourselves. There is a $10/day parking fee, which is worth it. The parking lot attendant is very nice. I would stay somewhere else- for the expense of staying here, we expected more. Upon check in we were given our keys, the process was smooth. Arriving to our room, we were met with pizza boxes, other garbage And a messy bed. We went to the lonby, swapped rooms. The second room had popcorn and garbage. Called the desk - they sent a housekeeper half an hour later. Who made excuses and took the garbage. There apparently were renovations going on, which we were not made aware of at booking. The renovations happened to be inthe rooms next to us!! Awoken early by banging noises! Told the receptionist- he did not seem to care. No apologies, no anything. Will not recommend. Beds were very uncomfortable. Doors did not seem secure. Very loud with the bar outback. I was very pleased with the location and the rooms were very clean. Room was very clean and had all necessary things needed for a confortable stay The bathrooms are extremely small and the parking was unpleasant Walking distance to everything in old town. Pretty clean, however we were both walking around in white socks and they weren't white anymore after an hour or so. Bathroom was way to small ,so hard to get in. Steps to second floor very narrow!! ! The location was great and the room was comfortable and clean. Breakfast is not included but they provide a restaurant next door Mary’s that serves delicious breakfast. It is walking distance to the Pedestrian Mall snd restaurants/bars and trolley. Great location. On the bay in the heart of the historic district. Room was nice, staff was great! Second trip to St Aug. Had stayed at a BW in town and enjoyed it, so thought we'd try the one by the bay.No way! Was not clean. Staff rude Great location, clean hotel, all updated. Beautiful View,  Nice staff☺ Hotel is in Old Town which is great. It’s beside the fort and across the street from the water. There are tons of bars and restaurants nearby. Rooms are a bit small but great for the price and location. There was some construction going on in the hotel that woke us up in the morning but no other problems. We were pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness and updated room. We’d definitely stay at the Best Western again, perfect location too. This was my second visit there and I very disliked my room location next to maid services. Very noisy always a laundry cart right outside my door in the way. The AC wasn’t very comfortable... kept having to turn down but always felt clammy in the room. When I checked out they didn’t even ask about my stay. Our internet didn’t work the whole time we were there. I stay for the location and those times I like to bring my dog. Very good location. It's close to shopping and the fort. They provide a coupon for a quaint breakfast place steps away. Very comfortable! Great Location, within walking distance of nice bars, restaraunts, and tourist attractions. Bathroom was a little tight, but the convenient location makes this hotel worthwhile. Very friendly and helpful staff. Quaint room, great location steps from great restaurants and shops, nice staff, and very comfortable beds! Great location and the staff was professional and personable. Room was comfortable. Parking can be a bit tricky but the staff handled it to my satisfaction. Bathroom mirror hung so high, I could not put makeup on in the bathroom. I am 5 ft tall. Excellent room with view We stayed one night in St. Augustine and found the Best Western to be clean and the staff was especially helpful. Rooms and location great!! Bathroom area too small. Great location but the music coming   from the bars and restaurants behind us was Loud through the walls late at night. Great location you can walk to all the sites from there. Perfect location, clean rooms helpful staff Great place! Parking is very tight and I was afraid to leave due to not being able to get into the parking lot or parallel park in a tight space...  but the staff were amazing and the location was just perfect, couldn’t ask for a better spot. Had issues with housekeeping and had to remind the front desk twice through the course of the day/evening time. Nice place, great staff, great location, bay across the street. Dog in the next room that barked for hours, staff called several times, people suck! The location of the hotel and friendliness of the staff were great. The floor in our room was very dirty and the sheets were pretty uncomfortable. The room was also very musty and humid. Other than that a great stay but will likely consider another location in the future. Right on bayfront and close to shops bars and restaurants. Downside is little parking and what is there is very tight. Great location with a nice view. Even though hotel is older, the rooms have been renovated and are very comfy and clean. Loved that we could walk everywhere from our hotel to see the sights of old St. Augustine. Only complaint is that hotel backs up to a street that comes alive at night with live music from bars which sometimes didn't end until 1:30am. Also, did not like that there was no restroom in lobby. This review will undoubtedly be considered insulting and not be posted, however it cannot be said any other way. Made reservations online. Buyer beware, because they have no affiliation with them and it's your responsibility to call the hotel/motel to get the right information, per the receptionist. To say the least the stay was very disappointing. Charged per day for parking on property. Charged more than twice the going rate per day (per pet) because of cost of cleanup. We have one small Maltese, paper trained and then it turns out the flooring in the room was laminate. Behind the door in the very small bathroom is a window with mold growing on it. This hotel is perfect for those who like to park and be close to everything. Walking distance to St. George and tons of dining places. Right across the street from the water and the fort so a very pleasant view. Parking is tight and you have to pay extra to park which I find a bit ridiculous but being that you don't have to drive anywhere, which would mean a fee for parking anyway, it's acceptable. The hotel rooms are sufficient- clean but tight. Very small bathroom but manageable. Staff was friendly during the minimal interaction needed. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel in the future. The convenience alone makes up for a tiny bathroom and $10 a day parking. Overall a good hotel. Probably the smallest hotel room I've ever had but it was clean and a great location. We parked when we arrived and walked everywhere which was a huge plus. Parking is tough to find so it was nice to be close to everything. The bathroom was tiny but clean. Older, small toilet. Bed was fairly comfortable but the blanket was old and very rough feeling. They need to get rid of those asap. Office staff were very nice and the housekeeping staff were very courteous and friendly when we encountered them. We would likely return there but I do believe the price is a little high considering the limited accommodations. This hotel has the perfect location. You can sit on the deck and watch the boats in the bay or walk out your door and turn the corner and be downtown in  just a few steps. The staff are friendly and helpful. We try to stay here each visit. The rooms are kind of small but if you are like us you don't spend much time there This hotel is a little dated but is the perfect location near the all shops and restaurants in Historic St. Augustine. We stayed here in July (which was very hot) and the room air conditioner could've cooled our room better but that is basically the only negative. Overall, it was a great trip and enjoyed our stay! Bathtub drain was stopped up even after they fixed it. Phone would not work. Keys to room would not work multiple times. Noises from young adults first two nights. Pool closed one day. Parking horrific. BUT...beds comfy and staff trying! I hope they are able to turn it around. If you are staying in St Augustine, the Bayfront Best Western is a great place. Clean rooms, friendly staff, perfect location if you want to enjoy the historic downtown area. Rooms were over priced b/c of location I guess !!! Parking was a challenge. Overall we enjoyed our time there !! ! Hotel says bay front but you are on a very busy thoroughfare, the busiest in downtown. The bay is across a jammed packed parking lot, across that street and then a pedestrian walkway, not actually on the bay. The hotel was over priced by at least $120 dollars. We paid $229 a night plus $21 for parking, that was not mentioned when booking, surprise! $250/night for the following: The lighting fixtures were horrendous, bathroom exhaust fan was so loud you couldn't hear the TV or your companion, couldn't wait to get out of the bathroom. Friends came by and had a look at the room and called it Sad, so it wasn't just us. We had room 214 which shared a party wall with a bar that played live music all day and night which was loud enough to ID every song. I imagine every room on that side shared the same music. I would stay away and look into any of the amazing B&B's that the town has. We were a last minute booking and paid for it. Had an excellent stay    Staff very accommodating and thoughtful   Room very clean and great location Stay was wonderful location you couldn't beat it and the folks there were terrific Parking was horrendous. Not enough spaces for the rooms available. Not able to park near our room and it is a hodgepodge parking story at best. This hotel is right in the middle of everything. I loved the location. Even with a bar next door on a Saturday night, our room was quiet and comfortable. I slept so well. Will definitely stay here again! Best location for a night on the town. The rooms were updated and clean. I will be back Close to everything. Enjoyed walking to most of historic downtown. Festival of Lights and the boat parade was fantastic. Every restaurant was packed but food was worth the wait. Great family get-together location. Loved the location of this hotel. The staff was very friendly and the room was clean and ready early. Only negative thing is they make you pay to park I feel that is completely uncalled for if I am paying $300 for a night of lodging then parking should be included. The only good thing about this hotel is its location! Very crowded in town. I like more laid back. Hotel very nice close to everything in old town. Just ok. It's clean but a bit outdated. Needs some new, modern touches. Thought the price was very high. While I was in the office the front desk clerk quoted a price to a walk in customer considerable less that what I paid. Doesn't seem fair. Very nice property and pleasant staff. Very attentive to their guests and extremely helpful. Facilities were very clean and comfortable. Park your car and walk everywhere restaurants historic district It’s a great location basic room bathroom is so small my husband barely fit Friendly Staff. Excellent Location. Air Conditioner too noisy.
nice lady on reception. Double bed was clean and comfy, single bed lumpy but clean, basin clean, mouse droppings in cupboard, whole place smelled of smoke, butts on patio, red mold on bath, blinds broken, dirty window tracks etc, old place shabby and needs full reno, The drapes were old and dirty. Overall cleanliness was poor. Hotel was OK. Shared bathroom which was a little outdated. Not that close to the airport but shuttle organised through hotel worked fine (for $20). Relatively close to a busy road and quite noisy with traffic during the night. This place was perfect for our needs. Clean, comfortable, friendly and affordable I booked for 3 nights but left 2 nights and they refused to pay me back for that extra night. The room was ok for one night before heading to the airport, but the room was really cold, the AC did not work and the blanket was too thin. Didn't like the check in process. No one at the check in counter to help us out, no information sent by email or text about check in. No mobile number to contact the motel staff! Clean and close to the airport,friendly staff. Good value for money My mum and I flew to Brisbane for one night from Sydney this weekend. I searched through Expedia for deals as this trip was thought of last minute. I saw Ascot Budget Inn & knew for the price - it would be perfect. Didn’t disappoint! The room was clean & fresh. Air Con worked perfectly, TV was massive. Shared bathrooms but they were so clean, & hot water pressure was amazing. Cute little outdoor area to have your breakkie & smokers area. I would highly recommend this motel to anyone & everyone & would stay again! I initially was searching for a accommodation close to the airport to catch an early flight and did not wish to burden the friends I stayed with on the other side of the city to get up early to take me. I also planned to catch a taxi to the airport at 4:30am to book in at 5:00am and was surprised the hotel provided a shuttle service with a friendly driver for a very reasonable fee. Then I discovered the location was between the two major Queensland racing tracks, Eagle Farm and Doomben and would have been convenient for me on the Saturday before as I had a function at Eagle Farm with phantom races due to the rain and finally to discover the Hamilton Bowls Club just across the road for a nice meal and a short stagger back to the motel. Thanks again... This is probably the best value hotel in Brisbane. Just a step from the Airport. Only 2 star hotel but very very clean, rooms quite small but that was just enough for a couple, looked like just refurbished. For extra king bed we paid extra $6 but I think it was worth it - was very comfy. The only think some people might think as a con is a communal toilet, but again, was not crowded at all + very clean so I did not think it was a big disadvantage. Lady at the front desk was direct and kind. Continental brekky between 6 to 8am + kitchen facility available all day long. Definitely we will be coming back. Highly recommend for a $79 per night. Pictures were adequate not like in other places!! ! Needed a bed close to the airport for one night. Definitely budget decor but it was clean, plenty of hot water and the beds were comfortable. Undercover parking was a bonus. I was a bit concerned about the place but what a surprise (in a good way). Building looked a bit old from the outside. Inside was beautifully furnished and nicely renovated. Excellent value for money. Will be going back for sure! Racecourse is a 2 minute walk. The place is a decent place to stay. It's clean though a bit old place. Aircon units in bedrooms doesn't work well. Had a family room, older hotel but renovated. Pleasant stay at a reasonable price. The older staff at the reception was lovely she kiwi working day shift  but the night one with glasses seem really arrogant which is not good as a receptionist 300 meters to Doomben railway station. Perfect position and great friendly staff. Excellent hotel, amazing and good localization and very clean. Time to breakfast is perfect and the staff are gentle and helpful As I only wanted a bed for the night prior to catching an early flight this accommodation was fine. Very clean; an interesting mixture of hostel/motel style. I'd recommend it for low budget accommodation. Pleasant breakfast bar/eating area flows to outdoor patio and garden. Free wifi and parking. Shared toilets and showers! Tea / coffee in room with bar fridge and handbasin. Coin operated laundry with washing line outside. Good cheap accommodation for people waiting on a connection flight the following day Budget motel clean and comfortable Staff friendly and helpful I searched online for a place with secure off-street parking and located close to Brisbane International Airport and Gateway Bridge direct to the Gold Coast. It did not take me long to find Ascot Budget Inn ticked all the boxes. Breakfast included in price and free wi-fi was a nice bonus. I would recommend this place if travelling by car. A comfortable and friend motel with the great service. Good value and accessible. unfortunately we didnt stay longer , we have had a lovely time and always a lovely breakfast The personal service upon entry and friendliness was excellent. The rooms were simple but comfortable. Has a bowls club across the road with excellent food. Unfortunately the bathrooms were communal but they were very clean and tidy with pleasant music playing. Very affordable rates. Would happily stay there again. To minimise stress in M1 traffic we decided to stay as close to Brisbane airport the night before as we had international flights and were travelling from northern NSW. I found this beaut hotel via Wotif and was amazed at the great rates for three adults. We found the hotel to be spotlessly clean and comfrotable for our night's stay. The staff were friendly and most friendly. The ease of booking, checking in and out certainly made our stay enjoyable. I would highy recommend this hotel for those on a budget, looking for a stress free stay close to the airport. Very Clean and perfect for a one night stay. Only downfall is that fellow quests not respecting the fact the hallway echos and they can be quite loud Close to airport, ideal for those catching early flights. Easy to find, quiet, simple and clean. Friendly staff and close to restaurants. The staff were extremely accomodating, friendly and informative. Unfortunately we had a cockroach problem having to dispose of several. The heavy doors to the rooms and narrow hallways caused a problem in as much with the banging shut every time a guest went to the bathroom,as well as the continued loud conversations in the hallway by guests again going and coming  to and from the bathrooms as well as checking in, continuing into the early hours. Found it a bit hard to go to toilet whilst a male in the shower across from you. Nice for budget conscious who don't mind noise while night- due to frontage of busy road that leads to airport Enjoyable,friendly helpful staff ,the motel is close to the shops and Hamilton wharf.It can be a bit noisy at times because of the busy road nearby The overall experience was great and being NSW country people the city was a bit daunting but the staff as advised us on how to get where we were going and a few hints on landmarks etc. The staff at this accommodation were unhelpful, unfriendly and difficult to deal with. The level of 'budget' accommodation was well below par with the smell, feel and look of the apartment nothing like what was advertised online. I have stayed with many places through Wotif. I will never consider this place again. Friendly staff. Easy to find.close to city.cheap. breaky included. Bowls club across street ,meals good.thet can take you to airport.hirecars next door.permanent stay.great. Okay so I should have double checked... But for the price: shared bathroom and toilet in the hallway, but even that could be okay. But the room was smelly, a lot!, carpet or curtain, something needs to be disposed of. Bed was borderline lumpy, and the facilities were spartanic at best. So dont go here, go somewhere else, there are plenty of choice in the area and for around $30 more (Hacienda Motel) Unit convenient to airport. Friendly reasonably priced prompt shuttle service. Decor a bit dated, but some attempt to modernise it. Nice meal at the bowling club across the road. very clean. Only improvement would be a better mattress, Great place if you arrive late into Brisbane. Friendly staff. Simple but convenient to have breakfast on site. A bit difficult to locate, but once found it was very suitable accommodation not pleasant at all. booked for 2 noghts only stayed 1. found accomidation else where Great staff, remembered me from one year ago when I stayed. Cheap, facilities not star quality but who cares when you get a continental breakfast and the staff are super nice. I would recommend this for anyone needing to stay near the airport for a night or two Great place to stay, friendly staff, nice continental breakfast, good sized room for a family, close to public transport, cheap and affordable. Had no blinds or curtains in room woke up with the bed in full sun it was like we were sun baking!
I am sold on the Pineapple. The decor is fresh, unique and gives it an unique style in a charming section of Boston. My room was a little tight - the whole of it was occupied by the bed with little space for ones bags and gear. The bathroom is tight too, especially navigating around the shower and sink. The amenities though are abundant - Keurig coffee with real mugs (talkin' ceramic here people), real cream, assorted sugars, waters, genuine towels, microfiber robes, a legit 60 umbrella and a slew of other things. They even offer bright yellow and green (think Pineapple) bikes to use about town. Perfect for getting up and heading out to see Boston. The hotel's neighbor is a bar with a great, lively crowd most evenings. For those who want to mingle with locals, you cannot beat it for convenience. There is no parking nearby - a multi-level parking deck is about a half-mile away . The hotel offers a parking discount (ask for their sticker!!). Street parking on Friday and weekends is free. If you got the parallel parking skills to swing into a spot, have no fear about ones car sitting there along the road and want to save about $30 bucks a day, then go for it. A cautionary note- nothing is 100% free. Those aforementioned amenities incur an $15/day charge on your bill (whether you use them or not). For me- 100% worth it. Others, however, might balk and take umbrage. Feel free to feign outrage and argue the charges be removed. It was inexpensive, close to where I work and easy to get to. Nice, interesting room. Clean and comfortable. Small. No desk/chair. Tiny sink. Overall a nice experience. The bathroom smelled as if a skunk had been living in it and the pillows smelled sour. Had a lovely stay at the Staypineapple at The Alise Boston, although when I booked it was called the Chandler Inn, so that was slightly confusing. Still, lovely place, comfortable beds, and lots of fun and funky details everywhere. Will certainly stay htere again. For 15USD/day I don't think it worth the quality. WiFi was limited to 2Mbps/1.5Mbps and I didn't use the other services. Paid 45 USD (3 days)  just to have a slow Internet connectivity. Hotel was close to Boston Common and many activities. The restaurant in the was convenient and good and had great staff. While the motel room was small, it was recently renovated and quite nice. The only downside was that my room was directly over the restaurant/bar and noisy until the bar closed. Don't stay on the second floor, go higher in the to get away from the bar and street noise. The Alise is a new hotel and they have not completed the remodel, including the lobby and hallways. That being said, it was a very nice place and the rooms were definitely new. The TV was very large and bed very comfortable. They don't have a desk nor do they have a mini fridge but I did appreciate the umbrella available for use as well as the robe and slippers. The vibe is hip and fun and they have a nice neighborhood restaurant/bar just next door called the Trophy Room which was convenient. You could hear when other people took showers in the morning as it's an old building. The staff were fantastic, happy to offer suggestions to restaurants and attractions and clearly loved where they worked. Excellent location, clean, rooms are small but great for a one-night stay! Great hotel - friendly staff - great bed This hotel is recently revamped in the quiet part of the back bay but close to everything. It is stylish, but very small. Great for an overnighter or if you're just using the hotel to sleep (great bed) and shower (great toiletries). 6 USB ports by the side of the bed! In room coffee. Bikes to borrow. Overall v good hotel. Room is small but quality where important - great bed, robe , shower etc Staff in bar really friendly and food excellent. Only issue was they attempted to charge an amenity charge of $15 on departure for WiFi when the booking site clearly advertised free wifi excellent choice of hotel, clean , convenient , with amazing bed , and really friendly staff Great little hotel, its just been rebranded so everything is fresh. Location is very convenient being just a few minutes walk from Boston Common. Although we didn’t eat at the Trophy Room I can say the food did smell amazing when we walked past. If I visit Boston again I wouldn’t think twice about staying here again. Had a great time at the hotel. They've done a wonderful job in the transition of the property. Staff was highly attentive and very friendly. As an example- The A/C in my room was not working, upon alerting the staff, a member came up to try and repair the unit. Unable to do so, they moved me to the adjoining room very quickly. First time staying here, as i try to visit Boston frequently. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff friendly abd helpful. Great location and convenient to all my local spots. Excellent location, very pleasant staff,comfy room
Following England cricket team for Cape town test and then sight seeing for a further week. Hotel is close to main tourist bus office which allowed for sight seeing to both inner and outer city sights such as Table Mountain (when open), Constanta wine tasting, Hout Bay, Botanical Gardens. Within 20 minutes walk of the hotel were National Gallery, District 6 museum, Cape Castle, Slave House, and Bo Kaap museum which I also visited. The Waterfront is approx 30 minutes walk from hotel. The staff was fanstastic, the location is fantastic. The only problem is getting booked into a room so close to the gym. Constantly hearing the dropping of weights was an annoyance. Also the cleaning staff slamming doors shut wasn't soothing. I really enjoyed the hotel but I can't help but think if I was placed in a better room I would have none of the above concerns. The simple fact is we were put right next to the gym. Other than that a fantastic hotel. Bad check in - they ask guests to guess how much they might spend in a day to determine the credit card hold authorization amount. Rooms not prepared as we had asked - after asking 3 times we gave up. We needed one room with one bed, and another room with two beds, which apparently is too much work for them. This hotel is falsely advertised on Expedia - they DO NOT have king sized beds. We were placed in a room with a queen and the hotel staff told me that was their king size. Elevators under construction for over a year now. Two elevators are available but very slow. Rooms very small, the professional photos are misleading. Be prepared to duck to not hit your head on the wall-mounted TV. Feces smell coming from the shower drain. New Year's Eve party poorly managed and folks without VVIP access were allowed in that area, creating a 40 minute wait at the bar. Communication from the top-down is non-existent. Every time we asked an employee a question, they said, Let me go get my manager. Staff are rude and act like you are an inconvenience to them. No semblance of customer service happening at this place. The entire hotel is disorganized and poorly managed. We stayed for 6 nights, so the problems were compounded each day. Bottom line - service is terrible. I can guarantee you will get more for your money at a hostel for a much cheaper price. Don't let your fabulous vacation to Cape Town be overshadowed by a terrible hotel experience. Hotel is in a good location in the city, close to long street and Kloof Nek. The rooms are very small and the furnishings are now getting dated. The bathroom is part of the room with the washbasin and the shower being in the room, which isnt great. The pool area is very small, so not great if you want to relax around the pool. I stayed here in December which was very busy, it took around 15 minutes each morning to get a cup of coffee at breakfast, there wasnt a coffee station to help yourself, you had to order from the staff, who were extremely busy. One morning had to wait 10 minutes to get cutlery as there was no clean cutlery on the tables. Overall I found this hotel expensive for the facilities and service. Upgraded free to loft with 2 bedrooms. Bedroom downstairs had no window,  noise coming from sewer pipe next to the wall and from garage. TV positioned at the end if bed, I almost went cross-eyed being so close to wide-screen TV. TV programming is very poor. Local calls and internet not free. Had to walk about 100 meters on the street from reception to the next building where lofts are. I dont know what the regular rooms look like, but I didn't like noisy, windowless loft bedroom. Hotel staff was fine, can't complain about their performance. Loft was clean. There was no security in the garage and one could walk right up to my room from there unabstracted. It doesn't feel safe on that street - I saw many people scawange garbage beans right outside the entrance to the building, and dubious personalities walking up and down the street. I love this hotel - I've stayed here twice and will do so again. Scored a corner room with a large balcony with a spectacular view of Table Mountain. Request this if you can! Good check in. Plumbing problems not resolved. A few of the restaurant staff quite rude. Complaints dealt with by one good manager. Check out a nightmare hotel tried to overcharge. Incorrect amount deducted from credit card overcharged by over 34,000 rands. Not amused. Good facilities, but the rooms were very small and cramped. No warnings were given about the room size. Small room. No bathroom. Poor lifts. Trickle only of hot water in wash basin. No globe in toilet. the only problem is that I forgot the black bag Mmimos paper bag which two hand bags in it, one is new. I tried to call with no luck. they always promised to comeback to me, still waiting Friendly staff, close to city spots and only 10mins from the waterfront. Breakfast was great, laundry was easy to have done, staff very friendly. Location was close to tourist locations (the Company Gardens, museums, St George's Cathedral). Great hotel. House keeping needs some attention though as the room is not supplied with coffee and water after day 1 See above direct torrent of air full time, hate that type of AC and never get it knowingly Wish I knew ahead of tlme! was tired and dirty at times not conveniently laid out and amenities were sadly lacking The hotel offers a shuttle collection from airport, could not email direct and I most defineately did not want to ring from U.K. I managed to get a response from Hotel via the Marriott hotels link. I requested a shuttle and thanked them for their response. The lady Ms Garrow was not in the office for a week and I travelled in 3 days from my request. So had to have a taxi to hotel. Not a nice area felt quite intimidated. Hotel is geared towards the younger generation very noisy at weekends. The Good The room was enormous. I stayed in the loft unit. Funky design Cool view of signal hill Super central so walking to any shops/restaurants was easy  The Bad WiFi is ridiculously overpriced at R500 for 2GB. This is seriously a problem for business travel. Room service was really poor with incorrectly labeled items on the menu. The gym was seriously tired and needs a renovation. No bedside lights and sleeping next to the shower is a little strange. The hotel is well situated but the noise level inside is unbearable. The music is pumping so loudly that you can't even hear what the receptionist is saying. The sound is muffled in the rooms but I was awoken very, very early by the cleaners who were standing right outside our door chatting and laughing loudly. Great location but too noisy and the hotel an overhaul. (The swimming pool was absolutely disgusting.) Good location, nice idea, food was good, hotel not great condition, lots of things broken or missing in rooms, not a big focus on detail when cleaning and stocking rooms The place had a tiny outdoor pool and no spa service in the hotel. Don't believe the website the spa is down the street in a small store which is hardly open. Very dissapointed. The restaurant menu wasn't up to scratch either not much of a variety. Internet service they only gave you coupons which you had to ask for all the time The tv remote didnt work and was only fixed a day after it was reported The tv had more snow than the andes It took longer than 90 minutes for a milkshake to be delivered via room service A wonderful hotel. Young and Vibey. The friendliest staff I have ever encountered at a hotel. It was just horrible. Will not recommend to anybody.Toilet flush not working properly and sink was not draining water.Heating seems to be not working at capacity. It was horrible place to be. My friend had same issuse. He was staying in room 205 and myself in 214.I am asking for partial refund. The bedrooms didn't have enough windows for natural light and I did not like the way I was treated when checking out, the lady wanted me to pay again and even when I explained that payment has been made she insisted on me paying again and also wanted my documents to make copies even though they were made on check in. I didn't like the service at all. I  will definitely not come back at this hotel. Arrived earlier than the check in time but my room was prepared within 15mins. Friendly staff; food in restaurant very good and reasonably priced. Good location to walk to Long St, Bree St and Kloof for food and drinking options Not so good. TV not working, Aircon not working, staff not aware of housekeeping rules; very amateur staff overall. Best ovation in Cape Town just moments from all the great bars and cafes of Bree St and Kloof St. Handy underground parking and loft apartments are superb value for money for the duplex split level space. Only downside is the air con was noisy!
Simple, nr sea, central, good view, clean and spacious Arcachon is a lovely town with a great beach. The hotel is very convenient for the beach and there are some excellent restaurants on the sea front and within the town itself. Great site seeing opportunities, especially boat tours  of the bay and also the Dune du Pilat. There were no major issues with our stay; staff were generally helpful. The apartment had a slightly strange layout, there were no plug sockets in the bedroom and the light switch was in the sitting room, meaning you had to leave the bedroom to turn out the bedside lights then come back in the dark. There was no plug in the bath, the receptionist gave us one when I asked, however, after bathing the plug became stuck in the plughole. One morning at 9am we were awoken by the door being opened, it was four members of staff conducting an inventory of the room, there was a language barrier but eventually they said they would come back later, but were then heard giggling loudly outside the door. We were given a leaflet on arrival that worryingly said a £50 cleaning charge applied when checking out, we were concerned about this but when we left it was not mentioned at all when we left. These are only small issues, but would have improved our stay a lot. The area is very nice and the hotel is very close to the beach and lots of restaurants. We didn't use hotel parking as we went at the end of September and there was plenty of free parking in the nearby residential streets. 200m from train station, city centre and supermarket, 30m  from beach. Staff was friendly, room was ready early. Clean and convenient. I would go back again for longer stay for beach vacation. Easy bus to dune de pilot.
Booked a city view- which is ideal if you do not spend lots of time in your room. We had 4 in the room (2 adults and 2 teenage girls) and the space was ok - all the items in the room assumed there were 2 in the room - glasses, balcony furniture and  towels to start with until I asked for more. The staff are brilliant and the food was amazing. The beach is great and did not get too disturbed by the building works but it does spoil the view. Overall we had a great holiday. First tome in Dubai staying at the Fairmont, Amazing luxury hotel with lots to do, would definitely recommend. Jon from guest relations was lovely and  looked after us, will definitely go back. We had an amazing week at Fairmont The Palm. The Fairmont Gold staff were very attentive and ensured we were looked after at all times. Fantastic service! We would thoroughly recommend eating at the Little Miss India restaurant. The food was superb with great staff. One of the best hotel’s that we have stayed at and we will definitely be back in the future. Lovely hotel with great location and fantastic amenities. Highly recommend paying a bit extra for Gold as it's totally worth it. The ongoing construction totally surrounds the pool area. It's loud and an eyesore plus doesn't seem like it will be completed anytime soon. Other than that the staff and property are lovely. Service is bad, manager on duty not professional to say the least, beach under heavy construction and there was no mention only a very small comment disclaimer that can hardly be read at the buttom page of Expedia. I’m an elite member on Expedia and this is supposed to be a vip hotel partner but you don’t get anything as compared to other hotels. For the same price try Jumeirah beach hotel... Hotel is nice, booked an executive level room. Ware and tare is starting to show; however it’s stil in very good condition. The entire experience was ruined by construction work on both sides of the beach/pool areas. Would not recommend this hotel before contruction is competed; which looks like would take more than 6 months. Enjoyed our stay at the Fairmont The Palm. There was some building work going on but this did not really disturb our holiday. It was in a great location, close to town and beach. The hotel staff could not be more helpful. Fabulous entrance, wonderful perfume! Spacious Room and lovely facilities within. Terrific turn down service. Wide selection to choose from for Breakfast at Flow. Loved the food in Frevo during Happy Hour....affordable. Faultless snacks and drinks around the Adult Pool Bar. Screening/View:(:(:( Sad Attentive Pool staff to maintain that it stayed under 18 yrs free at all times. Super Mini Bus shuttle service to the Malls. Hotel location is great on the palm. Breakfast fantastic with an amazing selection. Staff are brilliant literally can’t do enough for you as a guest. One problem is building work that is going on in the hotel and also in front of the hotel on the beach. It could be noisy sometimes and was a little inconvenient and we weren’t told of this before we booked. But on the whole the hotel and staff were great My girlfriend and I were really looking forward to our stay at Fairmont the Palm. After a busy night waiting to check into our rooms (and rudely queue jumped by an Indian family-no surprises there) the experience was first class. The room was spacious with a splendid king-sized bed, spacious shower and bath facilities and balcony too. Room service was first class, and the gym and changing rooms (a mini hotel I'd describe it as) were even more beyond my expectations. There are plenty of places to eat and drink within the hotel, especially the Cigar Room and the Seafood Grill. My biggest gripe would be having to pay £10 a day to use the hotel wifi. EVERY other hotel in Dubai (even Jumeirah ) has free wifi. Can the hotel reply to me explaining why the Fairmont charges for wifi? ? Great hotel on the Palm. 30 mins from downtown Dubai and easily accessible by taxi. Construction work means view of sea is restricted from pool area but apart from that, hotel very good. Great family hotel, good choice of restaurants and children’s facilities. This hotel lacks entertainment. No pool side activities or even music. Twenty four hour construction on both sides . Fairmont the Palm exceeded all expectations, we stayed in other 5 stars hotels in Dubai downtown but Fairmont with no doubt is outstanding for families and business stays. We were allowed to do very early checkin after arriving from overseas and a very warm welcome and a gift from the hotel was delivered to our room. the staff, the service and cleanliness including the location can’t be beaten. Highly recommended for everyone and I would definitely checkin again. The Fairmont hotel and staff are amazing,  My family have stayed at 2 more hotels on the Palm in the past and they have all been awesome  We will definitely stay there again, my kids loved it, food at its best, room spotless, staff could not do enough for you. If the standards at the Fairmont stay the same they are on to a winner. There is a bit of building work going on next door to the hotel, does not interfere in any way with your stay at all. To be brutally honest if you stay at this hotel and you are not happy, then you would never be happy anywhere  I am in the event/ service industry in Australia and I know the hard work that goes into keeping people happy and in my opinion the Fairmont is doing that 24/7  Keep up the good work everybody, it is working  All the best,  The hastie family - Australia We just stayed at the Fairmont and can honestly say we did not want to leave, we are back in the new year and are looking forward to it already. Have stayed in many wonderful hotels in the world and the Fairmont is in our top 10  Thanks from the hastie family   Happy Christmas to all the staff at the fairmont The location is beautiful on the palm. Service was excellent from all of the staff members. The room was perfect as well, with a great view and plenty of space. I also appreciated the Nespresso machine in the room. Everything was good except the construction all around, not ideal to rest It's a very nice 5-star hotel, but milks you for cash any chance it can. Short 1 night stay as layover in Dubai. Very pleasant experience. My girlfriend and I were really looking forward to our stay at Fairmont the Palm.

Hotel more than exceeded expectations. Location to marina is ideal if you are berthing for a few days or perhaps looking at a long term stay. Staff attentiveness and service was first class, being a prolific traveller and having stayed in hotels around the world this one stands out as a premium experience. Although there are restaurant options around the marina and Tivat the hotel offers a good alternative where the cuisine is limited, but superbly executed. Some development work going on nearby but not too disruptive and expected to be complete by end of June 2017. Ask for a room overlooking the marina if possible. Very nice experience in a fabulous area. Hotel is new and nicely finished. The pool area is limited in size and facilities. Just brilliant!!!!! Every request politely dealt with. Check in was horrible. First they said I hadn't paid for the room and wanted to charge me again. Even after showing then my paid in fill invoice from Expedia I had to call Expedia to get them to contact the hotel. We were a flight crew arriving early after a 10 hour flight and had to wait 6 hours for our rooms. After that it was a good stay. What a fantastic place -  nee elegant and service driven -  I will definitely be back for the elegance of it
Amazing service from the staff. Within seconds of arriving out front the bell staff was there to take our bags and help us check in. We had a vehicle, so we used the valet service. My only issue with the hotel was the $46 for parking. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. They have a complemetory happy hour at 5pm where they make you a drink with local gin or vodka. If you want a local beer, they are free after 4pm at the front desk. You can even have your own personal concierge. If you want great service this hotel is for you. One weird item is the 65” TV in the hotel room that doesn’t seem to fit. I’d stay here again any day and likely will on our next visit to Portland. once I checked in, they told me there is only one option is available for parking which is $45 dollars a night for valet parking. when I asked what the other options available, they said no other option other than parking on the street which you need to repay every 3 hours. What they did not tell me is that there is a parking right in front of Heathman which is 18 bucks per day. i would have found a cheaper parking option if I was not tired of driving 7 hours to get to Portland. A classic vintage hotel with updated rooms. A large 65” tv to help you unwind after a day of shopping and eating in Portland. Great central downtown location with friendly staff I booked the hotel because of their extensive library available to clients who stay there. The entire library was closed off and NOT available. Extreamly disappointing. I would of stayed somewhere else if I knew this ahead of time. Staff was wonderful. Really enjoyed my stay and drinks at the Headwater. The Heathman Hotel is renovating, no problem with that, down to one elevator. And when the remaining elevator stops running (which happened) there is a bit of an issue. Also, no chairs or table in our room so I guess we were expected to be either standing or laying in bed. Charge a resort fee - minimal amenities. Don’t understand why it was charged. Great location, beautifully renovated comfortable room and friendly helpful staff. The Heathman is a wonderful hotel. The brought up a dog bed and toy for my pup. The room service is great, the the food was consistently tepid, which was a shame considering the prices. Overall, a great stay! Nice room, but the pipes make a horrible constant high-pitched noise when the shower is being used, which makes it unpleasant. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Shower drain was slow. TV was difficult to figure out. The remote was nearly dysfunctional (battery?). Had only one chair. Staff was polite, helpful, and efficient. Nice location for our purpose. Good French press coffee service and high end teas. Will certainly stay again. We had a nice stay. The room was nice. The hotel is being remodeled so that would have been nice to know before we booked a room but it was still nice. I didn’t love the 9am housekeeping. Pretty room though but the bathroom was pretty small. The hotel is very nice but currently undergoing construction. My attempt at enjoying a long morning sleeping in was met with loud construction noises. $26 facilities fee + $45 parking fee add-ons and construction so only 1 elevator working at a time. The elevator took so long (15 minutes we had luggage so couldn't take the stairs) I had to call down to see if elevators were working...  Its a great hotel but I think I will just keep staying at the Benson. They made our experience really special. We went for our anniversary and the room was upgraded and a bottle of bubbly waiting, great experience! Beautiful remodel! Rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. I chose this hotel because it was adjacent to the Arlene Schnitzer concert hall, where I went for a show. Besides the obvious convenience of being next door, the MAX train stops a mere couple blocks away (red line  takes you directly to the airport) Funky hotel, with modern-style rooms (mine was newly renovated). I stopped in at Headwaters bar after the show, was also impressed with the food there. This was our second time in Phis hotel. We basically were disapointed. Was great, had someone available if I needed anything. Even had a cold beer for you at check in Amazing service from Hotels.com who helped me get a refund for one of the three rooms I had reserved. We were having a family weekend but one of my daughters became ill and couldn't come. Hotels.com worked with us and the hotel to refund a nonrefundable room for us. They had to push a manipulative desk clerk to get it done but they did it with grace. An A++ of service. Room was comfortable. Hotel is under renovation so pretty noisy during the day but not at night. No suitcase rack in our room but everything else was great. Our stay was great. Generally it was great but $45 for overnight parking was horrible and the $25 for what?? It’s already expensive to even stay there. It was very convenient to go to theater. Check in was horrible, staff was rude. Even restaurant and bar staff was rude. Only stayed for a night... But absolutely loved it!!! We will definitely be staying longer next time!! ! Great location. Folks at the front desk were very helpful. Would definitely stay there again. great - can't wait to go back in May Staff was amazing, kind and fast. Nice Property, undergoing minor updating/construction. Accommodating staff. Small billing issue, resolved fairly at checkout. The hotel is really well located, right downtown, so in walking distance to most things on the West end. They are renovating, so my room was very modern. The room has a french press, kettle and ground coffee, I thought this was a great extra! They also have complimentary drinks in the lobby nearly all afternoon, but really you end up paying for this in the end with their facilities fee - so drink up! The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and comfortable, and we had a great view of the downtown area! If you are looking for a hotel walking distance from really yummy restaurants and breweries, then this one is great! The Heathman hotel has character and a relaxing environment. Portland's Museum of Art is around the corner, and Pioneer Square just two blocks away. This stay was even better than my previous visit to the Heathman four years ago. i WAS ILL AND WE NEVER GOT TO THE HEATHMAN! WE KNOW FROM YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THAT IT IS A WONDERFUL HOTEL. Greeted by very friendly staff and offered some very nice champagne. Hotel is meant to offer old world charm and it pulls it off reasonably well. Room is a bit on the small side but very nicely appointed and the bed was very comfortable. Location is good. Valet parking only which is a bit expensive ($42 a night). All in all a nice place to stay but not truly exceptional. Would be nice if the restaurant was open for breakfast. Probably not my first choice if staying downtown Portland again. There are some other more mainstream options just a block or so away. For a hotel in this price range - you expect there to be an on-site restaurant and bar (especially if it is listed in the description). Not the case with the Heathman. I was told at booking Oh and by the way, our restaurant is now closed -- but in August we will have something new and exciting. Hmm - that is helpful. They do offer a menu of minimal lunch and dinner items (ending at 8pm - what?) -- coming from some restaurant -- but it has an extra surcharge, in addition to the typical room service charge and it is very generic. I'm sure it is out-sourced from somewhere. I had to ask for the menu, even though I was told it would be placed under my door. The description on this site is very misleading -- I hope they change it. There is no free bottled water either. Also - I had the experience of having my room fill up with marijuana smoke from the adjacent room at 2am. I called the front desk and was told there was nothing they could do -- but I should try to open my windows. I opened my windows and even more smoke came into my room. Evidently the room next to me was not walled off but had an adjoining door behind a curtain. This door had a good 1/3 of space on the top and bottom of it -- allowing the stink and smoke to come into my room. It was awful and I got a nice sore throat from the experience. If there was no pot smoke and they had an onsite restaurant as advertised then this would be a decent hotel. Instead it turned into unhealthy nightmare. This was our 25 wedding anniversary and word of mouth and internet searches lead me to the Heathman as 5 star 4 diamond hotel. I was let down by the size of the room, especially the bathroom (tub and toilet area extremely cramped, symphony suite - not a true suite) and by the street noise (on the 3rd floor). Packages for this occasion were very limited and staff made no special offers; however, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I would recommend it for location, but I would recommend ear plugs and noise maker as well as bumping up to the larger suite for a normal sized bathroom. I was thoroughly disappointed that the hotel didn't offer some amenities that competing high end hotels in the area do. I am accustomed to staying at The Nines & in my option this hotel didn't live up to my expectations by comparison. We were able to check-in with no hassle, which was the only plus. The room was nice & clean. The amenities in the room were next to none such as in-room slippers, music dock or an interactive TV experience. What I disliked most about the room was the restroom, which was the size of hall closet, claustrophobically small, step in & hardly able to move. The counter space was next to none, dark lighting & no vent.I didn't like that we were not able to call down to have our car brought around. There were a few times we waited at least 10 minutes for the car to be brought to the front which cost us $44 for the overnight parking. Overall I was expecting better customer service personality, especially at check-in. We were met with more gloom than friendly faces. This hotel is currently being renovated, but did not impact the stay at all. The management, Ms. White and Brittany Kauffman, went above and beyond to make sure my stay was pleasant and comfortable. I was put on a higher floor and could not hear most of the noise, but the construction did not last long. The room was amazing! Very spacious, modern and the bed was not too soft, but not too firm. I slept great. The location is also a highlight because you can walk most places. What a beautiful hotel and great location. The only problem was the guest in the room next to me was having a fight with a spouse or something over the phone and I could hear every part of her argument...at 2 in the morning. I eventually knocked on the adjoining door and they stopped. But those walls are paper thin. Everything else was very enjoyable. The bed was very comfortable and the layout of the room was efficient. Hotel was exceptional in almost all regards - staff were helpful and went above and beyond. Accommodations are world class. Only issue was exorbitant cost of parking which wasn't explicitly disclosed until I asked about the fee at check-out (~$50/night). The hotel feels claustrophobic - the room was so small I couldn't shut the bathroom door when I stood at the tiny bathroom sink. The cleaning service - made the bed up and that was about it. The lobby is small. Nice hotel. Great location. Great staff. Tiny room. Restaurant closed. Parking @ $42 per day is rediculous. Use lot in building across the street - $18 per day. We enjoyed our stay at the Heathman but the sink in our original room was leaking on the floor. They gave us another room which wasn't as nice as the original. We brought this to the attention of the manager and she offered us a mini suite and comped some extra charges we had. She went out of the way to make us happy. We would definitely stay there again. Customer service was poor. Room very cramped. Valet quite pricey. All good, perfect walking location to local things, nice lil' happy hour and really friendly staff. Staff made my experience wonderful. Even though I wasn't dressed to the nines, they didn't judge. Had a great staying in the historic Heathman hotel! Staff was excellent and very accommodating! Thank you for a memorable time! Only thing i wasn't too thrilled about was the resort fee per night!! Mr. K
This hotel does not look anything like the picture. Its located in a rundown plaza opposite industrial area. Per staff the parking lot is not safe to leave anything in your car. While driving to the location expecting to see the beautiful blue glass building you will see many homeless people roaming around. I was traveling with my car and had 16 days worth of belonging in it. Covered them with a sheet, they still were saying not safe. since the hotel is under construction and the carpets are new the rooms has strong smell of carpet glue. the first room had lots of hair on the cover, pillows and sheet. the room service said they don't have fresh food but can warm up morning macaroni and cheese for me in the microwave. the table cloth and sheets had holes. But the staff are really nice. They upgraded me to a suite and gave me breakfast voucher. But nothing can take that picture of hairs on the bed cover and pillows out of my mind. Even if the construction is completed the location is not good. I got room with a view and the view was the a cement making factory or something. First, for a hotel this size you’d think they can afford a bell hop. The folks at the front desk just watched me struggle with my luggage without offering anyone to help,  Second, room was dirty. Finger prints on the closet mirrors. Coffee machine was disgusting, my wife had to wash the machines before using it. Third, stayed for 4 nights. They provided 1 bottle of complementary water for a 4 day stay for 3 people. Fourth, no washroom in the lobby or the mezzanine. You had to use the unisex staff washrooom, which was disgusting. Bottomline, crappy hotel. The hotel was conveniently located to the train line as well as having a shuttle to the airport. Even though it was an off time they took us when we needed to go to the airport which was nice. There weren’t a lot of facilities. No vending machines in the regular restaurant is under construction. We considered the breakfast buffet but it didn’t open until 630 and we needed to be out soon after that. The room was good if not luxurious. You could hear the planes a bit. The worts room service ever and the food to. Nobody answer the phone Hotel was under construction meaning the restaurant was unavailable.Shower was not clean AND had to smell / breathe second hand smoke most of the night. Front desk staff was understanding of this issue and were friendly. Warning of the construction would have been preferred. Sweet & pleasant staff. Room was comfortable. Great location. Sadly, the restaurant was closed for remodeling which was inconvenient. Room was great, we didn’t know that the bedding was feathered and my wife is allergic. They came very quickly and changed all the bedding with a smile. Came during spring break at the end of march 2018. It looks like they have completed quite a bit of the renovations. Our last visit was November 2017 and they were mid way into it. The lobby looks nice and refreshed and they are finishing up the restaurant. We always enjoy staying at this hotel over the years as it is centrally located in Richmond. This is probably our 5th or 6th time. Upgraded to suite —- really sweet!! Friendly staff, helpful. Under renovations but that didn’t impact me. Ordered room service at 1:00 am, fruit plate and cheese/cracker plate - very good, fresh Easy parking, included. Would go again and would recommend to friends. Staff are helpful and allowed us to check in early All though there was some renovation going on it was the perfect spot to catch the Sky train into Vancouver and only minutes from the airport.. Staff were very good and quick to help out. Ok hotel close to Vancouver international airport. Good size room and clean. Breakfast is not included and actually very expensive $50 per person. The shuttle runs every hour which is very inconvenient. If you miss one you have to wait for an hour for the next shuttle. I will try another airport hotel before returning to this one. Even though my room was 3 from the elevator, the noise of the elevator could still be heard all night Hotel is very noisy being close to the train and airport. Nice hotel but lobby under renovations. Rooms are clean, nice gym and pool area. Quiet rooms and comfortable The bathroom needs to be updated and cleaned. You can see the stain in the tiles in the shower. Otherwise, the hotel is pretty comfortable. Some staff terrible,like the reception lady.but the cleaning staff and another man staff is good. Very fast check in, nice staff. The hotel is close to the airport so do hear some airplanes. It is close to two shopping malls but they are for the Oriental customers so no Western food restaurants available. The hotel is under construction so no food or beverage service. Not even vending or ice machines. Will be under construction until April. Bus leaves once an hour to airport starting at six am. Hotel lobby under renovation. Restaurant closed. Was hungry when arriving, was told to go to a pizza joint around the corner. Wish I knew it was closed, would have booked somewhere else. The hotel was under renovation which we didn’t know about. Th3 worst was hair in the bed and in the shower. Asked for a wake up call. It never came and we almost missed our shuttle to the airport Very good. The restaurants were closed due to renovation but there is a big shopping mall across the street Great location- unfortunately construction still going on in the hotel so no gift shop or restaurant. But great restaurants in the area and very helpful front desk personnel- they were lovely and very accommodating regarding parking for our family. We will stay there again when we return. I would recommend this hotel as a quick stop mainly for traveling out of YVR. We only stayed for one night but it was comfortable, parking was good and easy and the staff was pleasant. Although there was extensive remodeling going on, we enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and floor was quiet. Convenient location (can take Skytrain to to hotel), across street from the Skytrain Aberdeen Station, easy access of Vancouver downtown by train, close to Chinese restaurants in Richmond within walking distance. Although my room was facing the street and Skytrain, but can not hear any street or train noise. Always enjoy staying in this hotel Did not know about the restaurant renovations or would have stayed somewhere else Our stay at the Radisson Hotel Vancouver Airport was the most discussing experience we have ever had at a hotel. After arriving around midnight after a very long day in Whistler - all we wanted to do was shower and get a few good hours of sleep before an early 7am flight the next day. After getting to the room and showering, my spouse and I got into bed. After about 30 seconds, my spouse jumped up out of the bed horrified at feeling something wet. Upon further inspection we realized the bed was soaked in urine. Appalled, I immediately contacted the front desk asking for a manager and insisted a staff member come up and see what we were dealing with. The attendant brought another set of sheets to replace on the bed for us. REALLY???? You have a mattress soaked in Urine and your solution is to change the sheets? That was pointless and we asked for another room. We were told there were no other rooms available. At that moment we didn't want to stay at the hotel any longer so we decided to have the hotel simply take us to the airport around 2:00 am and took our chances with trying to get a couple minutes of sleep sitting in the airport, which I figure we calculated about 3 minutes of sleep between the two of us that night. I immediately requested to not be charged for the room and was told that would probably be taken care of but I would need to call the manager of the hotel on Monday to verify. The room was reimbursed as well as our cab fare to the hotel. Chose this hotel because of the complimentary airport shuttle. We arrived in the city around 10 pm after a delayed flight. With one phone call we had s shuttle whisk us away to our hotel. The beds are sleep numbers, so comfortable after a long day of airports and flights. The room was extremely clean and quiet. We had time before boarding our cruise ship the next day to go for a nice walk along the bay and by the Olympic Oval  felt very safe in this area of the city. Love the location. Near Aberdeen mall and other restaurants. Also near the skyline station. The staff is incredibly nice. Nick Fung and David really took care of us Room very comfortable. We stayed on the 12th floor, necessitating us to stop on floor 11 and ride a two person elevator up to the next floor - all the while holding the button inside. For anyone claustrophobic, this would not be a good ride. The restaurant FRESH was very good and the only option in the area. We chose this hotel because it was a location close to the Vancouver airport. Lovely room! Typically we don't sleep well the night before in early flight. The room was quiet and dark and the bed was a sleep number. Best sleep the night before and early flight my husband or I have had in a hotel The room was very nice with a large bed and lots of towels. Good location and airport shuttle. However, the hotel was very noisy and needs more soundproofing.......I was woken twice by a crying baby in another room, much to my frustration. Also not good enough sound proofing to keep out the noise from the metro outside. I also wouldn't recommend based on the fact that they took a deposit on my credit card despite the room being paid for in full AND didn't tell me that is what they wanted the card for. As someone who just has what she needs on her travel debit card in case of theft, this caused me an embarrassing situation where my card was maxed out. If they are going to take a deposit, they need to be UPFRONT about this and not say they need the credit card to 'check' and then take a deposit on the sly. It has been a week and the money still isn't back in my account....... Rude staff. Noisy all night with room next to lift shaft Very handy Location to Vancouver International Airport. Great shuttle service to and from the airport. We only had a very short overnight stay in transit but would use this hotel again to do the same. This hotel is a bit older and could benefit from some updates. That's not a big deal, if it's clean and well maintained. The carpet was stained in several places (hallways) and there was litter in the landscaping out front. Our room smelled musty (the windows were open, I assume to air it out), there was dust/dirt in the corners of our room and the coverlet on the bed was stained. I expect to pay a premium for the convenience of being so close to the airport; but this room was overpriced by quite a bit. I usually stay in mid-range hotels (Radisson, Marriott), and am willing to pay a little more than I would at a Motel 6 or similar hotel. I don't expect the amenities of the Ritz Carlton; but I do expect the property to be clean and well maintained. This room would have been a little over-priced if the property had been clean and well maintained; given that it wasn't, it was way over-priced. If I had booked the room myself, I would have seen the reviews. Lesson learned. I am using this hotel two to four times a year in the past five years. It is a well managed establishment with dedicated employees on all level. The hotel located near to the airport. The rooms have sound proof windows, thus the noise from the airplanes are minimal and not disturbing. The layout of the rooms are comfortable and practical. The quality of the rooms ire - generally - good. The WiFi works with acceptable speed. The TV channels are adequate. Good quality climate system with wide range of temperature settings. Good quality bedding, the adjustable bed firmness is something what you might do not like. The bathrooms are functional - and clean. The breakfast - I unused always only the buffet, however there is a la carte menu as well, that I do not know - is mediocre. Overall, I can say that it is a standard setting hotel for a four stars category. Others: Beside of the mall of the other side of the street, there is a very good size mall about in 2-3 miles when you turn left on the 3rd Street and reaching the Westminster Hwy (no, it is not rural area) at your right Richmond Centre It is a city block size. On the Westminster Hwy side, next to the mall there is an outstanding restaurant called Kirin. Reservation required. The opposite side of the street is a restaurant called Shanghai River. No better Chinese food on the American continent! Adjacent to the hotel walking from the second floor an excellent restaurant called Red Star. We checked in at around 9:30pm. The first floor is under construction. It was very difficult to maneuver our bags around to the elevators. We had a long day of traveling, and just wanted to relax and have something to eat. There was a paper menu next to the phone with  Late Night food from 9pm to 11pm. When we called to order we were informed the kitchen was closed. When asked why,  their menu clearly stated 9pm to 11pm, we got no answer. We had an early flight, I emailed and told the front desk we would need a shuttle to the airport at 4am before our arrival, and also reminded the front desk at check in. When we went downstairs the next morning, we were told the shuttle driver doesn't arrive that early. Meanwhile,  clearly on their site, it states they have a 24 hour shuttle service, and when I checked in, I was told the shuttle would be waiting. Instead, we were told a taxi would take us to the airport. The taxi did get there and we were not charged. It was dirty and smelled awful. We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport, said it had 24 hour airport shuttle, had a restaurant, and a Radisson(4 stars). We were very disappointed. We will not stay here ever again and I won't recommend it to anyone else. Only a short walk from Skytrain and from good surround restaurant. Only stayed for one night but I would stay here again. Great location close to metro stop, grocery store, restaurants. Room is spacious. Everything is great! The only complaint is the pillows are bit old and uncomfortable Overall the hotel is great and conveniently located with subway station  nearby.The staffs were very friendly. At first glance the room looks nice and comfortable. But when settled down I couldn't help noticing the dirty spots on the carpet and there were two dangling spider webs on the ceiling. The bathroom door knob was loose and saw hairs on shower curtain. Sleep Number Bed. Hotel Staff could use a little extra friendly training Stayed for a night before leaving on an early morning flight. Found it restful. had dinner which was good. Very Nice to stay in. Keep it up. Good location . Definitely I will return to this hote in Th future Location so near airport with hotel shuttle bus. Even we always have a night flight, still have stuff come to airport to help us. Limited meal choices outside of hotel. Mostly oriental food Friendly staff named Dave works at front desk. Hotel closes to shopping center and others actives Except for the first day, there were no bath gel and mouth wash. The complimentary bottle waters need to call for everyday. Never a smile or hello from the housekeeping staff. I been use this hotel 6 time last fews years. This is very convenience hotel and clean. Even not new hotel, but at less they keep in good condition. I'm Asian, I few the stuff are helpful even you can speak english or chinese. Great one! Easy enjoy trip. next building is big Asian market and another building is Canada line train takes cover all famous tourist destination. kind all hotel emp. It’s under construction remodeling the front entrance  small little replacement carpet in front of the entryway is almost tripped me.
Highlights - they had inter leading rooms, so Family was much more comfortable  - the room was quite large (compared to plaza hotels that are quite small - room service with chef food and silver cutlery - the gym was available at basement - in door swimming pool and sauna available in the GB hotel besides - 7 floor restaurant with acropolis view and 2 sections: open and air conditioned - this hotel el was a nice surprise, I feel got much value for my money The King George is a grand hotel, slightly faded from its hey day but still has a lovely atmosphere. Located on Constitution Square you can watch the traditionally dressed Greek soldiers on guard outside the parliament building. The roads are very busy just by the hotel but they give a great chance to people watch from the balcony - you can even see people boarding and getting off the red, four carriage, road trains, people coming and going from McDonalds and the locals enjoying the busy gardens on the square. The view of the Acropolis from the restaurant is fabulous, unfortunately unless you are in a room above about floor 6 you can't see the Acropolis from your room due to the built up nature of the square. We stayed here on 2 successive weekends. Both junior suites were clean, bright and well-appointed, with all the amenities. The lobby and common areas were attractive, stylish and well maintained. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out were fast and efficient, and the staff helped us with transfers to/from the airport and ferry port. Tudor Hall (restaurant) is a very well-run establishment, with attentive service, a creative menu, and very good food. The Jerusalem artichoke soup was truly superb; the grilled fish I had was also quite good. The dining room in general offers great views of the Acropolis, stunning when lit up at night, though some of the inside tables (and ours in particular) do not. The fitness room has plenty of equipment: 2+ of each of the usual cardio machines (treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike), some free weights and a couple of workout stations, mats and so on, all in good condition. Fantastic staff. Great view for breakfast. A proper luxurious five star hotel Was great location near Plaka and amazing room. Worth the higher price. great hotel. Forget about it why do I need to put in 50 characters? This is ridiculous . Give me a break. Fantastic hotel. Great staff, gorgeous view of the Acropolis during dinner. The hotel made arrangements for us to get to our ship and meet us at the airport. Could not have Bennett more helpful. Absolutely amazing hotel. Furnishings, decor, cleanliness of the hotel was outstanding. The staff was very helpful as well. I highly recommend this hotel. The suite we had was beautiful. We LOVED our stay at King George Hotel. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. Perfect location. Exceptional!! Every detail! Staff was superb! Fresh flowers, chocolates, wine! All the amenities of the boutique hotels and much much more! The view of the Acropolis from our balcony was AMAZING!! 10 stars! ! The hotel is well located with frontage on Syntagma and an excellent view of the Palace and the Acropolis. I took my wife there some forty years ago, before the current renovations, for a lobster and champagne dinner and to hear and see the Sound and Light Festival on the Acropolis. Alas, this time, there was no lobster and the Sound and Light had beaten the Retreat! Nevertheless, our visit was enjoyable! There is nothing that I think that would need improved at this hotel the staff was wonderful. The location Staff were so lovely throughout the entire experience. We loved our stay here, it's so central and yet so quiet. Great view from the restaurant. We will be back Super. Staff are accommodating, polite and friendly. we arrived at 7am we put put our luggage and came back at around 2 to have our room. the staff at the reception are very professional and so kind. they made an upgrade for our rooms (2) from classic to deluxe. the location of the hotel is exceptional, just at the syntagma square. the christmas decoration at the hotel is waaaw . Everything is super deluxe The hotel has an excellent central location, which made it easy to get to on the metro from the airport, and meant we could walk to all the main sights of Athens, including the Acropolis. It exudes period grandeur and all the common areas are beautifully furnished. The room is very comfortable, and the service excellent. The only criticism I have of the hotel is the high prices in the restaurant. The view on to the Acropolis is magnificent and the food is very good, but we didn't feel this warranted the prices being almost 3 times those in other perfectly good restaurants in Athens. €29 for a calamari starter that was little more than 7 or 8 small pieces of fried calamari really is over the top, as is €9 for a small glass of orange juice. Other than that, we were very happy with the hotel and felt it was good value. We would definitely stay there again. There is not a better location for visiting Athens. The square outside the hotel is beautiful, especially at night. The hotel itself is not luxurious in the modern style, but very comfortable and when you have a view of the acropolis from your room, it is hard not to be thrilled. The hotel is associated with the Grand Bretagne next door so access to Alexander's Lounge with its outside courtyard seating was very pleasant. We ate at the Tudor Hall restaurant in the hotel and had the best meal of our 4 week trip. The city tour buses stop within a three minute walk and the two hour tour is well worth doing to get an idea of the area outside of the historic district. We walked to the acropolis and museum and thouroughly enjoyed the hotel itself and the location is terrific. The couch in the room was broken and has been broken for some time. There was also no coffee pot in the room. When I called the management to discuss the problems, they said it was against hotel policy to have a coffee pot in the room and to fix the couch that could not be sat on, instead of addressing the problems. It turns out that other rooms in the hotel had coffee pots and instead of giving me one, they just refused to do anything about it. As for the couch, they need to repair it, even though it may actually need to be replaced. But to tell me it was against hotel policy to make repairs made me realize that they just did not want to do the work. The AC also did not work in the room and they refused to send a technician to the room to correct the issue. They said that I would have to wait to the following day, so I had to try to sleep in a hot room, which is not good. I rented a room that was not adequate or comfortable. After I left, I received a we are sorry email but did not offer any compensation or to correct anything in the future. I highly recommend not staying here cause if there are any problems with your room, they will not be addressed during your stay. This hotel is fantastic - loved it. My only comment would be that we were disappointed with the rooftop dining experience. From the website I thought there was open air seating. We also had a negative experience while being seated. We were told we could not sit in the fine dining area because the gentlemen in our group were wearing shorts. They were both wearing dressy shorts with nice shoes - not cargo shorts and tennis shoes. We were then seated outside in the heat along with the guy at the next table who was wearing a sleeveless tank shirt. We didn't feel at all in the same category. Meanwhile in the dining area there were gentlemen wearing jeans and casual polo shirts. The situation was corrected after we complained however the damage was already done leaving us feeling quite unhappy with our dining experience. The food and wait staff was excellent however. Great location, easy walking distance to absolutely everything, efficient pleasant staff, room good size and nicely furnished. I was deligthed to have a bath, however the shower screen design and the non adjustable height position of the shower head meant that it was impossible to shower without flooding the bathroom floor. The first time resulted in soggy clothes and thereafter, three soggy towels every time. Also for us, as a family with adult sons, the lack of any bar area was disappointing. There is seating for 6 directly infront of a fire in the restaurant, but nowhere else to meet and chat pre or post supper. We made sure that we left before any nearby tables were occupied as it would have been uncomfortable for both us and them. There is a large atrium on the ground floor which has lots of tasteful seating but no 'atmosphere'  and was not used by any of the guests during our stay unless awaiting taxis to the airport, or to check in/ ask questions at the service desk. Location of the hotel is very central; mainly walking distance to most museums and Acropolis (20 min). We had reserved a king size bed room; even though the hotel was relatively empty, we ended up with a very small room with a queen size bed. There was a column next to the bed, which made it very hard to go to the other side of the bed. The room was in between the service elevator and the emergency room, and on the same floor as the restaurant; therefore was noisy. We thought that it wasn’t a good value for the amount of money we paid. Awesome everything The hotel ambience, service and stay was great. The shower / tub combo is a little risky for older people. The restaurant has great ambience and service but is expensive. It was exceptional in all ways. Each staff member was delivering top notch service every single time. No exceptions. The concierge service was perfect. We would go back in a heartbeat, knowing we will be taken care of. Perfect location for all downtown Athens attractions and outstanding service on every level at this hotel --- and was even provided a room upgrade at no additional cost! We'd stay there again without any question! Great hotel with wonderful staff. Beautiful view from the balcony. Amazing great service and extremely accommodating staff!
Hotel is very nice, staff friendly and food really good Beach small but clean I really enjoy my stay and next year I am going to spend another time in Acapulco Beautiful hotel! First time in Acapulco and would definitely come back to this hotel. The only downside is that it is a bit far from the main city center but the views and hotel are worth it. Loved the small private beach area and the pools. Amazing place great food and amazing staff. Down comforter is listed as a room amenity. There was only an empty duvet and bedsheet. Asked the front desk multiple times about the down comforter and was told there is a spare fleece blanket in the closet. Housekeeping finally put a comforter in the duvet but instead of a down comforter housekeeping put a synthetic filled comforter in the duvet. Inconvenient location. Spotty wi-fi. Housekeeping didn't clean the glass cup and bathtub. Crappy water pressure with the ecosaver showerhead. Noisy hallway. Construction across from one of the buildings of the hotel. I asked to switch rooms during check-in and was denied a room change. The following morning construction began early and woke me up. Was finally given a room change but new room was next to the lobby and the television from the lobby bar was loud. Good hotel general..food ok Pool good. Ocean right there
House keeping cleaned my staffs rather the room. Thieves  Super bad beds Only 5 min walk to metro station. Near restaurants, shopping, and laundry. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast basic, but adequate. Modern facilities. Rooms small, but sufficient. Good, inexpensive hotel for exploring Paris. Don't even have cup provided for drink....like disposable cup etc No shower cap or cotton provided The word budget is in the name of the place, so you get what you pay for. Yes, the rooms are extremely small and the shower is not private, but if you're staying with people you are comfortable with and it's only for a night or two, it's not a bad deal. No toothbrushes provided, no kettle to boil ur own water. Otherwise generally still alright. It was Good , but about 10 mins by walk from Metro Station / Restaurants . only few EU-TV channels, cooperative  Staff
Generally, we had a nice stay but the Marival Residences misses in several crucial ways. PROS: Rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable and ours (5th floor) had a nice view. Food was excellent at Omaggio's, Insu (great view) and Lemmon Grass. The pool area is lovely and so is the beach club. It's not ideal to shuttle to the beach but we never waited long. CONS: They make you wait in the bar to check in. Sounds nice until you realize it's so they can pitch their Vacation Club; truly terrible start. Service is hit or miss; usually not enough waiters. At brunch we waited too long to get a table cleared and set; service priority was random. Poolside, it takes forever to flag a server, get drinks or a menu. Miguel was awesome but some of the staff do not belong in service. Waiter at Omaggio's took my husband's order first for every course and drink. Letting people smoke there at dinner is backwards especially with 3 tables with children around. I spent a ridiculous amount of time just waiting to sign for the food, even though we had the all inclusive. Carlos (concierge) made a dinner reservation at Las Palomas at the sister resort; they had no reservation and sat us at the worst table even though it was empty. Carlos also insisted on keeping my son's toy to repair it with glue; he never contacted us or did anything, and instead lost it. I ended my trip listening to him call lost and found. Staff promising to do simple stuff and not following through was a recurring problem. The Demi Pool rooms are great. You have reserved pool chairs off the patio in front of the semi-private pool. The pool staff (Ernesto is the best) come and check on you all the time to see if you want drinks, food, snacks. The temperature of the water is nice and warm. The hot tub is in a shaded private area. It's very calm at this resort, but if you want more activity just take the 2 minute ride to the sister resort. You can go to a club, Theater, beach games, beach dance party, VIP Beach Club. The food at Marival Residences is so good. Best food between the 2 resorts is Lemon Grass at Dinner Time. It's a new menu every night from an amazing chef. Guillermo is a great waiter over there. 2nd was Italian Night at Omaggio. 3rd might be Chilequiles in the morning. The rooms are huge. No hidden charges. The staff was amazing. The hotel was well cleaned. The food was amazing. I want to come back soon Amazing resort! Loved every bit of our stay! We had 1 disappointing meal at the Mediterranean restaurant at the other resort but all other food and drinks were awesome. Staff was wonderful. We will be back. The demi room could not have been more perfect! My family and I had a wonderful week at Marival Residences! One word of advice is to be  prepared for the sales pitch when you get checked in and the concierge representatives were a little rude. However, the resort staff were amazing and super friendly! food is top notch, drinks excellent, very friendly staff. Service was a little off this time from past stays but still a great, relaxing vacation. We booked our a air/hotel package deal with orbtiz . Booked based on traveling with myself, son and his two 17 year old friends. I completed the booking process and paid adult prices based on their ages. As orbtiz considers17 years olds child. Our booking according to hotel was two adults and two child. Although I paid 4 adults. When I arrived at hotel, i was ordered to pay 2100us as they stated they did not receive compensation for the 17 year olds. I paid as I am in Mexico. I am currently working with orbtiz and hotel to get my 2100k back. This was to be a grad trip, ended up being very upsetting. I'm hopeful the head conceriege at the hotel can help. I would like to note that my husband was not part of the package and he came for 4 days. I called the hotel ahead and confirmed they would charge 150us a day for all inclusive rate. When I got there they wanted to charge 220.00. We were able to get down to 150. We later heard some folks paid 75.00. I am hopeful. This will work out.... This was our first trip to Mexico and the Marival Residences exceeded our expectations by far. Everyone was so helpful and friendly and the food was great...definitely better than expected for an all-inclusive resort. Miguel was our server at the pool and he was amazing. Went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for our entire family. I'd come back just to see him again! One tiny problem... We stayed in a villa and there was a terrible smell in the master bathroom...turning on the fan made it worse. Other than that we have no complaints. One small suggestion: the room service menu was fine, but didn't have too many snack options...like food we'd want to eat late at night or while hanging out by our private pool. Would be nice to expand on that a bit. Would definitely come again! This hotel is beautiful! This was the first hotel that actually looked exactly like the pictures. No  construction, weird mildew smell, or strange disturbances. The food was  Great if you are coming to Mexico to eat American food. They only had Mexican food night which was a bit disappointing. To actually have Mexican food you have to go to a restaurant in the sister resort which is a shuttle ride or 10 minute walk away. Also be careful if you have food allergies. The language barrier makes it difficult for waitstaff to understand when you're asking about allergens. The menus  say gluten-free and vegetarian but they don't list what is nut free or dairy free. I would have wholeheartedly recommend this hotel until my doctor told me that what I thought were mosquito bites were actually bedbug bites. I was shocked considering the hotel was so beautiful! Without having spent any time in Puerto Vallarta or surrounding areas I was a little worried the hotel may not be as clean or relaxing or full of time-share harassment, but I can honestly say this was one of the most amazing trips we have had. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed as though we were regular returning guests. We stayed for 7 days and wish we could have stayed longer (although a pretty nasty hurricane followed our departure so maybe it was for the best) We upgraded our room to the penthouse ocean view and were stunned with what we got, it was better than our apartment at home. Stunning view of the property and coastline with a rooftop deck with private pool, perfect for watching the sunset or even just a private soak. The restaurants were the biggest surprise, we can't say enough about how good the food is at this resort, I've been to a handful of all-inclusive resorts and it can be pretty hit or miss. We maybe had less than 3 items on the menus from the variety of restaurants over the course of seven days that I'd say we weren't happy with, two of which were from the sister resort a few blocks down. I loved the staff and their attention to detail, the food was great, the facility was clean and beautiful. The only thing that was a little different was that there was no direct beach access from our resort, we could sort of walk around some private homes to get to it or take the free shuttle to the sister resort which had complete beach access but to be perfectly honest the beach along this particular stretch of coast isn't exactly picturesque, the water was warm enough but not really the same sort of white sand you get in the cancun side. Not a big deal for us really, we were perfectly happy with the pools and activities we had available to us. Would definitely recommend looking into this if you are serious about having some R&R and great memories. I would have given this stay more stars except the check in process was horrible. The good: hotel was clean/modern. The food was excellent; our daughter requires a gluten free diet, and there were lots of options for her and if not the chefs were always willing to make something. we loved that we had access to the sister resort but glad we didn’t stay there - the Residences was much quieter and less crowded. The bad: the check-in process is horrible. I’ve stayed at many resorts in Mexico and know that if you don’t book directly with an owner, you are going to be approached for a timeshare/club membership talk. At this hotel, they corner you during check-in. On arrival, you are escorted to a room away from other people; the check-in process involves different people and they go through the whole good cop/bad cop routine, they promise  lots of things if you agree to listen. I didn’t want to and they continued to berate me - I could not get my room key until I raised my voice and demanded a manager. The next person wanted to talk to me about tours and told me several lies in order to try and make a sale. These people are obviously commissioned based and don’t give a good first impression to the hotel. As part of my res, I was given 2 free tours but again I couldn’t get it w/o doing the talk. We hated the place on day 1 but everyone else was amazing that we did a 180. We were upgraded to a penthouse suite for the last half bc we were upset, which helped but we didn’t need it. This vacation was nice. We were surprised to learn than free unlimited internet still meant limited numbers of free internet. We had 4 rooms with 8 people and they treated us like we had one room and 4 people. One voucher per person and could only use on one device. We only had 4 settings in the kitchen for the 8 people. We had the VIP package that included our own concierge but this was the only concierge for the property most of the time so that wasn't a real service. The lines to speak with the concierge were long at times. The servers worked very hard but were understaffed. The owners and platinum RCI renters had priority for the beds and the loungers at the pool and beach until 11am. I had no idea this was a timeshare property. It was nice but had drawbacks. We will not be back. If we were at the sister property (resort and not the residencies) we would have even been more limited and disappointed. It was packed and the restaurants were held for these owners/platinum members to eat first. We absolutely enjoyed our stay at the resort. The food and drinks were excellent, the wait staff were stellar. The rooms are spectacular and very large. This was sour first time at this resort. We cannot say enough as to how great our stay was. The staff, food and location exceptional. Raquel Garcia our consierge made our stay the best we have had in Vallarta. It was our first time staying at an all inclusive and we were impressed with the facilities, staff and service. Only downside is you have to shuttle to the beach and I wish the wine selection was better. Hotel was great, staff were exceptional and would do anything to help make your stay a great experience. The only part of thie I would change would be the beds, they are a bit hard but manageable for our stay. We had a great time, the staff was great, the food was great, and the hotel was very clean. We would go back for sure! This property is incredible. The staff is always very helpful and friendly  Would highly recommend this resort. The new beach front Mozza Mare is one of the nicest I have ever seen. This has always been our favorite resort because of the size of the rooms for my family of 6. They have recently opened their own beach club, which makes the Marival Residences an incredible property!
Can't fault the hotel at all. Great staff, really clean, really great facilities. Good wifi in all areas of the hotel. I was pleased with everything in this hotel. I highly recommend it. Hotel was great upon arriving from a hot sweaty day exploring. Very safe and clean and nice beds with a great view from our room window. Breakfast buffet was wonderful. Hotel was very nice and staff was attentive and friendly. The restaurant had both Indian and International food. Overall satisfied. Great location, friendly staff, clean and well appointed room, good breakfast, limited restaurant facility, good gym. Stayed in a Suite Corporate Room. The room was clean, confortable and spacious. Visited India every year and would rate Le Meridien Hotel with highest score 10/10. Duty manager and staff were very cordial, highly professional and ready to provide top-rated services. Excellent location close to Janpath and Connaught Place. You will not regret your stay at Le Meridien. Overall a very nice hotel. Staff are very helpful. Breakfast is excellent and lots of good food to choose from. Buffet or a la cate dinner, reasonable price. The only complain I have is - The hotel temperature is too cold for comfort. Room thermostat cannot be adjusted. Will recommend this hotel for any visitors to India. Great staff. Kites and plugs and faucets had to be fixed. Great service, helpful staff and has nice jewelry shops. Walking distance to Indian Gate and Parliament Buildings. love to stay at hotel, maintained, good staff and proper security is there. Very polite staff. Vast selection of very tasty breakfast. I had a great night at this hotel. I was very pleased and comfortable with my room, bed, and shower on the SPG 11th floor. Breakfast was excellent; everyone was friendly and helpful. Especially the man working in the business center! He provided superior service. I downgraded my service rating a bit because my friends experienced difficulties with noise from a party and lost a good amount of sleep in the middle of the night. It was so bad that the hotel refunded the cost of their room. So in the end, good service made up for the bad. A very nice hotel. Love the modern styling. Excellent internet. Won’t stay here again!!!! The customer service wasn’t up to par. A host moved my table in the executive lounge because it was “reserved”. After further investigation there weren’t any reservations and my table was moved simply to make someone else comfortable. I felt humiliated and belittled. Not only was I lied to but I was disrespected. I will not stay here again!!! SPG should be embarrassed and ashamed to allow such blatantly disrespectful behavior. Outstanding customer service...few minor issues; the room was weathered in appearance and all toileties were hidden in a drawer including chocolate bars, chips, etc plumbing was an issue since toilet water was darkened. As for concierge - when i said that i wanted to do tour of Old/New Delhi i did not think that a taxi would be called over and concierge advising driver where to take me with limited english. Also i was disappointed since i was unable to accrue Starwood points for five nights since hotel was booked through hotels.com. Despite these factors i was very pleased with hotel location, friendliness of staff and heightened security. Great location. Easy walk to Landmarks and shopping. Had a wonderful stay in the suites. Soundproofing is good, breakfast has a decent spread. Dnt like this place at all The hotel is outstanding. Wi-Fi worked well throughout the building. Breakfast offered a wide selection and was delicious. Rooms are spacious and clean. The hotel is a great deal for the money. Staff is very friendly. Hospitality was good but it is a run down building...SPA was closed, no indication of it at the time of booking...needs a major refurbishment... I loved my stay in this hotels every thing was perfect nothing to complain I highly recommend this hotel to everyone Hotel and shop staff were helpful and concerned that my stay was the best possible. Excellent service and friendly staff. Went out of there way to meet any food requests I had been to Delhi with friends and stayed in this hotel. It was convenient to locate the hotel and it was close to the city. The staff members in the hotel were helpful and friendly. There was no delay in check in and checkout. The room allotted to me was spacious and it was well maintained with all required amenities in working condition. I ate food outside the hotel. There were no activities in the hotel. Overall, I was satisfied with the stay and it was value for money and I will recommend this hotel to other travellers. We visited this hotel in the month of February.

It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service in both bar where we had lunch and restaurant where we had dinner. Food was beyond good and great value for money and service in both places attentive and efficient. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable.

I’ve been to Innsbruck about ten times and first stayed here in 1992. Twenty six years later, on what was probably our last time in Austria, I can proudly say that the Hotel Innsbruck has been consistently outstanding. I’ve never stayed at any other hotel in Innsbruck. What the Ischia family has accomplished all these years of fantastic service will never be forgotten. We were here in March 2018 on two separate stays between Innsbruck and Salzburg and stayed in room 507 both times. From check-in to final check-out I can’t thank everyone at Hotel Innsbruck enough for the great memories over the years. We had an early flight out that was well before breakfast but the gentleman at the Front Desk arranged for breakfast to go and a taxi at 5 am. I’ve never experienced this kind if service before, but again, the Ischia family knows the hospitality business. For some it may be “just” a hotel, but for us it has been years of happy memories and first-class service. We will truly miss Austria and the Hotel Innsbruck. Staff very friendly. Ideal location for Christmas markets and centre of town. Breakfast very good. We stayed here in December and it was wonderful. We were on the 5th floor in a triple room. It was clean and well kept. The view was beautiful. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was vast! Everything you could possibly want. I would definitely recommend, we would return in a heartbeat! In addition to the hotel being so conveniently situated to both the old and the new town, we enjoyed the view across to the mountains and the river, also the relaxed atmosphere within the hotel, the pool, our comfortable bedroom, the cuisine and friendliness and cooperation of all the staff. We look forward to our next visit to this fresh and tastefully decorated hotel. Central Location Great views from the superior nordekette rooms Staff is very helpful Hotel outside appearance is a bit run down, and it is on a main road. However inside is modern and efficient. Breakfast buffer very good choice and well managed. Evening dinner menu was too traditional for me. Pool is nice and big, seating area is inadequate and occupied. You have to pay extra Euro15 per night for parking nearby. Hotel is entered through a cluster of smokers. Only one lift was working so had to carry bags up / down stairs. Overall good, just creeps into the 4 star category. Wifi worked Lovely hotel in a good location nice rooms and pool .Have stayed there  three times and it does not dissapoint. Great hotel in the center of Innsbruck and the main train station is in waking distance. Very nice indoor pool and very good breakfast, bar service and food. The hotel is right off of the historic center with breathtaking views of the mountains. The breakfast staff and breakfast food choices were exceptional. The parking elevator was challenging at first but not a deterrent. Wonderful stay. Checked in at 12:30 PM and, even though official  check in wasn't until 2:00, they fond a room and let us check in. Room was large for European standards and very comfortable. Would stay there again. Great hotel very close to the Golden Roof and the main tourist area. We only stayed two nights but longer would have been better! Breakfast was excellent with lots of options. Very close to the bridge to get across to the excellent Due Sicilie -about 5 minutes away and Excellent Italian food! Comfy bed, two pillows each, nice shower and bath with good water pressure. Minibar with reasonable prices, and lovely bar downstairs also very reasonably priced. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay. Quick checkin from Karina. We asked for quiet room at back which we got. Not huge room by big enough. Madam got a shock whe she stepped out of lift on Wellness floor. We did not know about mixed saunas but soon adapted. Good breakfast. Late checkout. Around corner from restaurants and bars. Smoking in many bars and cafes awful but almost avoidable. Banned from next year. Bring it on. Recommend Restaurant Piani and Bar Iniva. It was a pretty good hotel for its star category. Rooms were small. Bathroom was great. Very clean. Curtains did not block the light very well. It's a real problem for those, like me, who need to sleep in after a huge night out. So if you are person who likes to wake at the crack of dawn, this light filled up room is great. For those who can't sleep with the light, avoid this hotel like the plague! Great hotel, but don't expect the free parking that is advertised. You MUST specify that you want the parking or you will pay 14 Euros a day in a lot not on the premises. The free parking is underground and is limited. The website did not explain this. We enjoyed our stay and loved the location of the hotel. This is a great hotel in a great location. The free breakfast was awesome! WiFi was off and on some days but that was the only negative.
Service is flawless, with friendliest staff. Breakfast is delicious, with plenty of options. Public areas are in good shape, but rooms need some renovation. The tiny bathroom is a big negative.
Overall a great place to stay for a few days while exploring Cadiz. this is the best hotel in the area.a true 5 star.the best staff and great rooms and hotel areas. Beautiful old hotel. Lots of character. Big rooms. Very nice breakfast
great site with the great facilities and staff Great site with a great facilities, service and staff Except the reception on first day,which it was your fault. All other were fine. Pleas notice on next booking that we wont meet the same issue. Double booking. Staff didn't confirm the room availability despite booking confirmation. Unpleasant and rude staff at the reception who doesn't know how to smile. Poor servicing. Took atleast 1 hour to get even 1 water bottle. The hotel is very commercial asking to pay for even for basic things like ketchup. Our rooms basin was leaking but still didnt get another room. Had to stay in the same one. Not a pleasant stay at all. Hotel was overbooked and reservation was not honoured all things was good except the air condition in rest room was bad and there was bad smell in the room . Location is very good. Nice beach and aqua park. I can't say that service and the food is 5 star. The hotel location is great and the workers are friendly except the recipient they are not professional and so rude.
Great location very helpful staff and comfortable bed. I would stay again Very clean with friendly staff. Room was spacious. Not a lot of local amenities but close to the U-bahn so it is easy to get around. Very nice hotel in a quiet area. Very good breakfast.
Location - End of Lavante from old town Room - Tidy/Basic. Cleaned daily. Wifi. No AC Decor - Air gap around AC. Held in by tape! Noise - Quiet, but toilet flush extreamly loud Food - Plenty with good selection Reception - Underwhelming staff Would return though!
We got a great value for money. A charming hotel at the beach. Beach is nice. We needed to pay for the sun beds but towels were included. Grass in the sea made the seawater dirty in afternoons. Rooms very clean. Staff polite and friendly. Food is excellent. Receptionists were the best part of the hotel. Quite hotel, silent and peaceful. Fabulous sea. The rooms were worn out and not isolated. We could even hear the lowest conversations. Paying extra for the sunbeds and umbrella was ridiculous. No shower in the beach. You have to climb up stairs. No drink and food service to the beach. The fish choice was very limited and the only available one was too expensive for Greek restaurants. There are no tavernas in the close vicinity. The hotel price was very reasonable. I may consider to stay there again. Very nice pool but small beach. You have to pay for beach chairs. Only a few employees are helpful. Most are just rude: no one offers to help even When they see you struggling with your suitcase....Very mediocre food.
I stayed here for two nights in January. The hotel is in a good location and walking distance to most of the big shopping centres and less than a 5 minute walk to the closest train station. The room was very spacious and comfortable with all the amenities you could want; separate shower and deep soaking bathtub, huge soft bed, writing desk, coffee/tea making bench, well positioned power points (very important!). The concierge, porters and front door staff were all lovely and friendly and helped a lot with organising transport and giving advice. The front desk staff were more efficient... It was nice to be able to leave my luggage in the hotel on the last day, as I had a late flight out. I used the gym showers before heading to the airport, which was essential after a long day walking around Bangkok. We spent two nights at the LitBangkok. We were 2 adults and 2 children and stayed in the family, triple luxe suite. Expedia sells this a suitable for 4 people, but really it is a three person room. The hotel kindly provided extra linen so one child slept on the sofa. The inconvenience was outweighed by its excellent location. Minutes from Siam and Paragon, SeaLife and Jim Thompson's house. This is a modern hotel with good facilities. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very good. Lit, is a great hotel to stay in and has close proximity to almost everything! The skytrain is minutes away by foot, the National stop. There are nice restaurants a stones throw away (also good dining options at the hotel & I love room services! Try the papaya salad! So delicious! ), street vendors. Easy to get a tuk tuk or taxi with super friendly doormen and lobby staff, The spa is WORLD CLASS and they treat you like royalty with some amazing options to pamper all of your senses. I also loved the pool and steam room. I really feel like Lit had everything that I needed. I would highly recommend a stay here with no hesitation whatsoever! Nice, comfort and accesible to the BTS station. Could have some halal options for food as i see number of muslim families stays in your hotel. It was a pleasant stay at LiT Hotel, the location was great, just 5 minutes walk from the Siam area. The hotel had all the necessary facilities for a short stay and we enjoyed our stay thoroughly. Value for money and comfort 4 stars hotel. We have a good stay Location location location...just in heart of BKK and just steps from Skytrain. But road traffic  can be bad in this area too. Uber and Grab take time to get to the address. Property in excellent condition. Rooms on the small side but with space well used feel bigger. Safe, clean and quiet. Overall, good price-value correlation. Convenient location, close to transport, shopping and everything else. 3 min walk from metro station, comfortable enough but room a little quirky. Great area to explore the huge malls & walkable to old town yet lots of transport options available. Pleasant stay & would go back. Very modern hotel close to shopping malls. Good breakfast. Nice swimming pool. Tube is 15 min awat. Modern architecture but not convenient. Small dining room and  limited breakfast Hotel is near BTS- Nationals stadium and walking distance to siam discovery/siam area. Breakfast was not fantastic at all. Voucher of spa 1200 tHB only valid should you signed up 70mins of their spa package. room was clean and spacious :) Good Hotel overall, though if I was on a budget, I'd probably pick Mercure or Ibis hotel as they're both nearer to the BTS station and without the small lane leading to Lit as the lane can be hard to walk when there are cars. Pleasant staff, but check-in was slightly delayed cos room wasn't ready at 3pm. I enjoyed the stylish and chic ambiance of the hotel. It’s near the BTS station. Excellent hotel in excellent location very close to mbk The service was excellent I definitely recommend Amazing hotel..... Spotless, modern and brilliant service We wasn’t in the hotel long as it was just a quick stay before flying back to the UK. Would of loved to have had time to enjoy the pool and spa. Hotel was lovely. Good breakfast too. Return guests. Generally good but taxis provided by concierge can be improved. Airport small taxi  - 400 baht but after getting on, driver insisted 500 baht. Mpv taxi booked but private car provided. Disappointing Very modern design and a cool little hotel, but our room was not ergonomically thought out. Breakfast was great. All of the staff was very friendly and welcoming but the little guy that registered us at the front desk was a bit arrogant. Excellent location for shopping, national stadium and BTS access. For some reason, I got a really great deal for this stay, so I felt like everything was worth it. Didn't spend that much time at the hotel, but really impressed by the unique designs. Room was specious but has lots of nooks and crannies, so be mindful if you are on the clumsy side :p I didn't go for the breakfast option since there is an abundance of options in Bangkok. It is a short walk (approx. 2-3 min) to the BTS (National Stadium station), and you can also walk up that same stairs to the overpass to MBK, Art museum or Siam Discovery/Center/Paragon that are all really close by. Staff was not friendly upon arrival. Got better the next few days. Great location. Very nice hotel, not cheep.Staff are very good. Boutique hotel but, quite big.
Great location between Central Station and the Red Light District. We had two quad rooms in their other building over the road. The beds are all narrow singles but very comfortable with white cotton sheets. The bathroom is a modern wet room but the shower never got hot. There is an alternative shower room outside the room that did get hot and also an alternative toilet which was great with four sharing. The building is very old and the walls and floors are very thin, you can hear every footstep above you and the room below can hear your conversations. No Kettle or iron in room. All in all, not bad value for money. The stairs to our room where very steep especially when carrying suitcases, the room was clean and the beds were comfy, but could do with more space to keep suitcases out of the way. I did find a lighter under my bed which made me question how well the rooms were cleaned. There was a housekeeper who came around a few times but couldn’t speak English so it was hard to ask for a new binbag! The heating didn’t stay on very long so the room got cold quickly and the towel I was given had holes in it which gave a bad impression... but over all It was a nice room right in the centre of everything and our room was right above one of the many waffle shops, with a small supermarket round the corner. I stayed here before in October 2016 and I must say I was so impressed this is why I returned I came back here March 2018 but this visit wasn’t as nice as the first I was in room 14 and paid a lot more for the stay than the first time only this time The room was smaller a lot of dirt everywhere and dust the bedding didn’t looked as clean as it should have there were stains on the bedding we took 2 friends with us they said they defiantly won’t be returning they were in room 11 again not a very nice room and a room where you can hear every single noise! Comparing both my stats I don’t think I could return back to this hotel compared to the first time I couldn’t fault it but being a returning customer and being put in a room like that I dread to think of I returned a 3rd time what room that would be! The room itself wasn’t very good. Damp walls, I thought I’d spilled a drink on my pillow. Chewing gum stuck to the wall and wasn’t cleaned for the whole duration of the stay. Overall unclean room. However, the staff were excellent and the hotel was in a very convenient location. Couldn’t have been in a better location, staff were lovely , rooms were lovely have nothing bad to say Room was standard, sheets were not cleaned every day, however room was tidied. Bar has a happy hour between 5-9pm and breakfast is reasonably priced. Our room didn't have hot water for the last 2 days, despite letting the reception know, it was not fixed. For the price of the room it was basic but did the job. Really close to everything. Would recommend a double room rather than a twin room, as our friends room was not as good. hOTEL IDEALLY SITUATED,EVERYTHING CENTRAL.HOTEL EVERYTHING WE NEEDED FOR A PLEASANT STAY. very very convenient location like 2 minutes walk to central station Amsterdam. Nice room and the most important is ELEVATOR. Staff were great!!! the room was a little small but clean. Happy hour from 5-9 was excellent!! Great central location 3 mins walk to centraal station 1 min from RLD all in all great spot **** Great little hotel, loads of character. Perfect central location. Basic but comfortable room. Easy walk to Central Station. Sound echoed in the hallways and water pipes made noise. Not recommended for light sleepers. Would stay again but upgrade to a canal view on a higher floor. Amsterdam is a great walking city and our hotel was in a good location. The staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. The location of this hotel was excellent, walking distance to almost everything! Hotel service was very good, although beds weren’t very comfy and rooms were small, but perfect for a small get away! Despite having booked a twin room with canal view (paid extra) back in November we were told on arrival that there were none left and given the only double room with canal view available. Not happy. Promised a free coffee which never materialised. However the hotel is very close to everything and easy to find. Reception being in the bar which can be very busy not good as staff are serving customers. Bonus having a luggage room which was very useful. I would stay here again if I was given the correct room. Checking in to the room was the first disappointment. After queuing behind a couple for around ten minutes, who were checking into their room. The gentleman at the reception completely ignored us for about five minutes, with not even a smile to acknowledge us. When he finally looked at us and invited us forward to the desk, the check-in process took 5-10 minutes. In our opinion, this process needs to be streamlined and shouldn't have taken this long, based on experiences at previous hotels, within Amsterdam and elsewhere. However, the staff were happy to speak in English which was a relief as our Dutch is only very basic. The bar within the hotel is very rundown, the booths are torn and uncomfortable. The room was in the attic which meant we had a lot of steep stairs to climb (there is no lift) which is rather difficult with a 22kg suitcase! The room itself was clean and tidy but the beds were like sponges and considerably smaller than a single bed, they were uncomfortable. The shared shower and toilet facilities were modern which made up for the fact that they were shared. However, I do not think that they were cleaned regularly as the same pair of underwear was in there ALL WEEK. On our last night, the mirror fell of the wall during the night but thankfully didn't smash due to the small shelf that was directly underneath it. Room needs double glazing! Big draft from the windows and so noisy, there was a cafe below our room and at 5am they had a lorry arrive with delivery! Booked a double room but was given a very small twin however we were moved when we went back to reception. Dirty hand towel in bathroom, no hairdryer, no hand soap . Breakfast was cold THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS TIMY HOTEL IS ITS PROXIMITY TO CENTRAL STATION ON A LOVELY LITTLE STREET WITH LOTS OF BARS & RESTAURANTS. EVEN A SUPERMARKET CLOSE BY. HOWEVER PTHE ROOMS ARE REALLY V VERY SMALL UNLESS YOU SPECIFY A CANAL FACING ROOM BEFOREHAND, WHICH ARE LARGER. THE STAFF ARE FRIENDLY & HELPOFUL , & THERES A COZY BAR DOWNSTAIRS. The rooms are ok but one of the room that we have booked had a small little mouse running around at night. Stayed here with three others - had three rooms between us. All of which were clean and tidy. Exactly what we needed for our one night stay in Amsterdam. It’s located in the centre of town. Has a fabulous bar and serves food too. Food was pricey but so was everywhere else. Would defo recommend! Hotel Old Quater was close to Grand Central Station Recently stayed with two friends, the staff were amazing and helpful. Would stay again every visit to Amsterdam Great location, friendly staff and mattress was fine. Stairs would be tough if you aren't agile and the whole bathroom is wet after a shower! Nice hotel close to everything, the hotel staff is nice and there is a nice bar in the lobby of the hotel that it is possible to play darts in there. The location is great and in very popular street. The stairs to the room are awful, too small and twisting. Great location near the station and 5 mins walk from the square and main streets Great hotel! Amazing staff & nice clean rooms I would definitely stay again! pleasant enough to stay in. clean and tidy although bathroom a bit too small. however, hesitated to eat here cause of the roaming  house cat. A long story short, one of us could not make it on the trip due to illness. Orbitz contacted the hotel to inquire about a refund on the room. Needless to say, the hotel management returned to the pre pay room. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very pleasant and courteous staff. We could not check in but were provided a location for our bags to venture out in Amsterdam. I was initially given a room on the main street that was some what loud. The hotel gladly changed me to a room that was more off the street. Our complete stay was filled with getting to know the staff (they are wonderful people) and exploring the Netherlands. On every occasion I had to interact with them, it was nothing but how can we help. I will be returning again with the member of our group who could not attend, an I will be staying at this place in the future. The hotel is 5 minutes from the train station and short walks to all Amsterdam has to offer. It's proximity and casual bar was fun every day. I cannot express enough what a great hotel and staff can do for trip. They made it one of the best trips I've been on and I've been on many. Really close to the red light district. Fair price, Comfortable beds, and clean bathroom. Party and Amsterdam should  be synonyms... well, you can get that for sure when you realized that your hotel's reception is an entire bar so the party starts since the moment you check in... the views are amazing and the prices affordable Inside the bathroom the sink was tiny and with a glass shelf on top which is almost impossible to brush teeth or washing faces. Have to give 10 Euro deposit to borrow a hair dryer everyday. The hotel room is very small and the location is very noisy at night because it is among the bars and restaurants. Does not worth the money I paid. Will stay farther away from the area and pay less next time. Room was very small and basic, but pretty clean. The staff really made the stay nice - they were super helpful and enjoyable to talk to.
I stayed in the smoking floor and the smell was really overpowering as they did not have ventilation. However, my double room was big enough for huge luggage and space to move around. Staff were also friendly and helpful. Great location right near the quiet back streets of Asakusa. The room and bathroom were small but this is Tokyo. Hotel a bit dated but staff were always friendly and helpful. If you want to spend a lot of time in your hotel room this isn't the place but if you want a place to rest after a long day you could do much worse! The property is a run down building and rude staff and bad services. Room are very much not clean and extremely dirty bad for children Simple but old hotel. Good enough for sleep. Airco not working. Some fungus in the bathroom. Still cleanb bedroom everyday. No breakfast buffet. Choose from 3 plates. Can walk from Subway station 5-10 min, but if you have many stuff it's not ok. Wifi can not connect. Room clean. Overall ok. Super nice location with a lot of restaurants surround!! It’s close to tourism spots as well. This in was between at least 2 different subway lines and walking distance to Tokyo Sky Tree and Buddhist temples. In general I like Unizo Hotels and Inns. The Asakusa location, however, the room was not very clean, I could see pockets of accumulated dust and hairs. Also, the reception desk was not convenient as it was situated on the second floor and you were reached it by stairs or elevator. Beyond this I liked the location and that the staff permitted us to leave our luggage for a few hours before our departure. Great experience I would stay here again my next visit.
The perfect location to expore the Gion area and loads of transport options nearby. The hotel was clean and modern and the service from the front desk was A1+ Spacious room, great location and good breakfast and facilities. I would definitely go back again. A nice hotel with an average to good breakfast. The location is great if you want to be near some lovely temples and right in the middle of hoards of tourists. If I end up in Kyoto again I'll try to stay a bit further west towards Nishiki market. Good location to see the Gion area. It is on a bus route to Kyoto Central. Also close to bus routes  and metros to to see all the main points of interests in Kyoto. The staff was very helpful in giving us the directions to reach the main sites. The rooms are small, but very comfortable. There are no cupboards so all your clothes will have to stay in your suitcases. Would definitely recommend this hotel when staying in Kyoto. Great location in the Gion area, helpful staff, good sized, clean rooms and nice breakfast. Very handy to Gion. Nice staffs and facilities. Also very nice breakfast. Overall pleasant, simple hotel but comfotable for short trip. Main advantage is nearby to Yasaka Temple and short walking distance to Kiyomezu dera Temple Only 10 min taxi from train station, right in the centre of Gion area, so beautiful, handy to bus stops, lovely hotel.
Found this little gem on a last minute search and was pleasantly surprised! The location is excellent! Close to shops, restaurants, bars and many interesting tourist attractions. The area is extremely safe for tourists and locals a like. Rooms are small but very comfortable and clean. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive to all of the guests needs and requests.The breakfast which was included with my reservation is delicious and satisfying. The downside of the hotel is that there is no pool, although on the roof there is a very cozy terrace for the guests to enjoy. The other downside would be that the gym is literally located across the street! aside from those minor details I can recommend this place for anyone travelling alone, who plans to walk around a lot and not even think of working out this is the perfect place for you! I will definitely be returning! The hotel staff was great and efficient with our very late arrival. Their concern for our safety  was quite obvious they made sure that our drivers were reliable and trustworthy and spoke our language If ever to return I will stay at the hotel. There are two hotels on the same street with the same name drivers usually stop at the first one download a picture of the hotel mine was most helpful Have a great experience at hotel breakfast was good and the stuff is friendly and nice This is one of my favorite Hotels in the Dominican Republic. I love sitting on the balcony eating the good food served by beautiful waitress and watching all the beautiful ladies walk by. Now that is worth traveling several thousand miles for. Overall experience was good. Mattress could have been more comfortable and shower a little bigger. Great hotel on the el conde ....near restuarants and great history The staff was very friendly and helpful. Many were bilingual which was helpful. Still some construction going on that did get noisy a couple of times. Verifone was not working when we arrived and the person at customer service at that time had a bad attitude towards us. It was raining and he wanted us to leave the hotel to go get the money in cash. Very nice staff in a premium location. Parking was a bit tight, but everything else was great. Good breakfast in the morning, too. very good hotel nice stay I only stay few hours but great great please , nice locations old town center, will come back again soon, nice staff very professional, cleaning room I recommend this hotel 100 ,Boutique type hotel. Very nice hotel on the el Conde ..clean rooms..very good breakfast. Friendly staff. We stayed at the hotel in 2008 and said since it was good the first time we would stay again. They recently completed a renovation in February. Hodelpa is a small boutique hotel in the middle of the Colonial Zone. 1: Near to great restaurants. 2: Walking distance to clubs and bars. 3: Near the airport just 20 minutes away. 4: Good buffet breakfast each morning. 5: Meals on men are basic but good. 6: Staff willing to help  7: We had a superior room and it was a good size. 8: Good Wifi. I really can't say anything negative about the hotel. it's not a five star with its of services offered but if you are looking for a clean, decent, great working staff, good size room at a reasonable price then Hodelpa is the place to stay. The room itself was very nice and comfortable. Hotel Parking was very important for us and it was free. Breakfast buffet was very tasty and good options. The only issue was it took a long time to get coffee. Hotel was amazing, the service was excellent as well. I Recommend staying here if your looking for a nice place (it had a recent face lift) with a staff that serves to please. Location location location .. is next to cathedral on main square with many little restaurants and street music .. hotel was very nice and room excellent .. we had a room with balcony on Main Street .. excellent staff , very clean , very good breakfast and friendly people .. nothing to say bad about this hotel.. stayed here two years ago and it has just gotten better Great hotel. Hotel staff excellent food at Azul great. Will definitely book again The room was small with no facilities such as coffee/tea. The staff were mainly inattentive especially in the restaurant where they were more interested in each other than their customers. Amazing room. Half of staff bilingual. Use Uber if you can. I have stayed here a number of times, but this stay was not up to expectations. The room had a number of issues. This room had not been remodeled as some of the other rooms. Had a some leak in the bathroom. Shower door kept coming loose, and there was a leak in the ceiling from the room over me. I will never stay at this hotel again the service very poor and the hotel is under construction and that was not told to me at time of booking Hotel was centrally located. Short walk to many restaurants and bars. Service- the restaurant service was pretty slow regardless of the number of patrons. The wait staff in the restaurant were not very responsive during breakfast which is interesting because there are less than 15 tables. The best service was provided by the bellhop(parking). Rooms-the mattress was pretty firm, the shower drain was pretty slow, no ventilation or fan. Food-free breakfast was pretty good and plentiful. I'd recommend this place as a buget friendly hotel but they really need to improve the condition of the rooms and the customer service. breakfast is free but too crowded - restaurant to occupancy ratio is about 1:10 I enjoyed my stay breakfast was great, customer service was excellent The staff is very kind. Breakfast, excellent. It is close to the city and can meet a lot of people. Very nice Hotel at the center of everything. I would recommend it for a short term stay. Rooms were clean and comfortable but very small. I would go back again if I were to stay at the colonial zone. From the staff to the morning breakfast, everything was excellent. The staff was helpful and friendly. There was a nice assortment of food for the breakfast. The rooms were very clean and stock with needed essentials. Check-in and check out was quick and easy. The hotel is conveniently located near many sites, parks, shops, and restaurants. This was my second time staying here and I highly recommend it for your stay in Santo Domingo.
The location of the hotel is excellent, just steps off the main square. The hotel is in serious need of a complete upgrade. The rooms seem very dated, but are kept clean and are a good size. The morning breakfast is adequate. I have back problems so I like a hard bed, but this was the hardest bed I've ever slept on and I'm sure most people would not be comfortable with it. The front staff was very accommodating, but not so with the pool attendant. I was told I couldn't bring a bottle of water from my room to the pool because he sold water there. The 'pool' is more like a large tub, but the view is pretty. Speaking of views, I had a superior room which had a view of the roof of a building next door. I could have almost touched it and it totally blocked my entire view. Every night there was a noise like someone hammering coming from one of the rooms. The front desk seemed to be unaware of this when I asked about it. I would not stay here again. Clean, tidy, well run with lovely staff who could not do enough to help you. The roof top pool and bar is great. The rooms are clean and tidy. Thy may not have amazing views but they are fine. You are two minutes walk from anything you need in the middle of Sorrento. A small and decently priced place among some other less well maintained hotels. My thanks to the staff for taking such great care during my recent stay. They really do seem to take looking after you as more than just a job. Great location. Very helpful staff. Enjoyed a lot. This hotel was a great find. First shower in Italy that I could bend down in. Nice room, great breakfast and the head waiter is a real characte. Has nice common areas. Nice plunge pool and roof top deck. Will stay here again. Room was OK with basic furniture of old world charm - shower was in bath (narrow bath with high side) which is not for everyone. Buffet breakfast (included) was good generally but ran out on one occasion so we had to chase staff about more food. Reception was OK but limited we felt. We enjoyed our stay both in Sorrento and at this hotel. It is well located and comfortable. Our biggest challenge was finding it and then finding parking which cost 25 euros per 24 hour period. After getting rid of the car, we had an enjoyable stay. The staff is welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was great and the view from the top floor is awesome. An immaculate hotel, just off the main square with lots of cafes, restaurants and shops. Fab roof terrace with views and a small pool. Very attentive, friendly and helpful staff. Lovely hotel just off Tasso Square. Less than 10 mins walk from bus/train station. Lots of restaurants close by. Centrally located. Excellent hotel. Definately to be recommended Staff were very friendly, rooms spacious and very clean, beautiful location close to beach. Would go back to the same place.. Getting around was very easy, we walked everywhere was absolutely breathtaking. Friendly hotel with great staff. Very clean room and bathroom. Great location. Basic but tasty breakfast. Close to shopping and restaurants in a busy high traffic main square. This hotel was an awesome experience - the hotel staff was super friendly and helpful, it was always clean, and it just was an amazing place to stay for our honeymoon! This hotel was a great place to stay. It's in the center of the main palazzo in Sorrento with many choices for restaurants in the immediate area and a close walk to the port, for boat trips to Capri. The hotel had a great breakfast, with a very entertaining waiter. We looked forward to seeing him every morning and also having the great food. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Sorrento! ! Great hotel. very nice and spacious room. balcony with chairs and a table was lovely. Great location in beautiful Sorrento. We stayed for 3 nights while on our honeymoon with our 16 month old baby. The hotel was okay, pretty basic and was surprised about the 4 star rating (3 star more appropriate). Was very disappointed to find out they don't have a kids club as advertised. Instead they offer hourly baby sitting at about 25euro per hour, which is more expensive than the usual kids club rates. We complained to the hotel, but we're only offered a reduced rate of the baby cot to 15euro instead of 20euro!!! Cor prices are the most expensive we've ever paid, even at 15euro. Location was excellent and check in was quick. Breakfast wa the best we had in Italy was the room was very noisy, close to the alley way where they set up the restaurants everyday. Could also hear the people in the next room using the toilet. Not nice. Room was good. It the bed was hard and the pillows very flat. Room wa clean but nowhere to hang towels. Very nice hotel in a perfect location for everything we wanted to do. Been many times. Love Sorrento, love this hotel. Beautifully restored landmark hotel. Located very much in the heart of Sorrento    Much larger rooms than you find in most of Italy  Easy walking distance to eateries, shopping and the port This hotel is conviently located just off the main square in Sorrento. Pay the higher price for a seaveiw with balcony it is well worth it. Staff are friendly and helpful and there are lots of great restaurants nearby. We had difficulty finding the hotel as it is not accessible by road. There is no parking at the hotel and you have to park in a public parking 500 meters from the hotel at 25 euro a day. The room is very simply and sparsely decorated and it doesn't feel like a 4 star hotel. Great location Right were you want to be, steps from town center of Sorrento, steps to parking. This is a good central location as hotel prices are good, and easy to go on day trips to Pompeii, Positano and Amalfi and of course Capri. The hotel was unaccommodating amenities inside the room we're never replenished staff was very unprofessional poor customer service..would not recommend Throughout Italy each Hotel gave us water this hotel we ask for water and then they charged us on our bill Great location, service and breakfast. Easy access to Porto di Sorrento. The rooms are very nice. The staff was amazing to accommodate us for 3 days with only making reservation for first day. We stayed in 3 different rooms, a new one every day. Pro - got to stay in 3 great rooms. Con- beds a VERY firm. Just an FYI What an amazing stay! 6 th trip to Italy, many hotels visited and this experience tops the list! Thank you Corrado, Marco and all for an incredible stay! You are awesome! The Palazzo Guardati was totally charming.We haired a car with a driver from Naples to Sorrento, The woman who was working at teh desk, met our car and took our luggage, and took us down a sweet lane to the charming hotel. She was very helpful, although I recommend taking a tour  if you are going to Capri. We are very independent travelers, and as our usual practice, we decided to look for the bus stop to take us to the ferry to Capri. We never found the bus stop. It is a steep walk, and then there are  buses to find  once on Capri. the  tour we took  was only pennies more than doing it all on our own and not the east bit intrusive on the experience. I do think that both teh  travel books and the hotel should recommend  taking a  tour. We stored our large bags and took smaller bags to the Amalfi coast, The hotel was willing to keep them for us while we were away. Breakfast was lovely and every inch of the hotel reminded us that we were in Italy. Recommended by a cousin, and I will do the same. In fact, I rarely return to a same hotel but this one I would. From the moment of our confused arrival (our driver was lost) and the help from the front desk, English speaking staff, beautiful room and large patio, all was nearly perfect.
Room was only fair. The staff were exceedingly helpful and welcoming. Hotel well placed for the beach and attractions. Ok it is an hotel in Rivazzurra (Rimini) quite closed to the seaside, but you cannot pay more than 80 euro for a supposed to be 3 stars hotel with very small room, old forniture, old bathroom and a very poor breackfast if you arrive late....
We have styed in this hotel with my wife and friends. The hotel is in good condition. it has the basic facilities. Modern refurbished, clean, the staff is friendly, the breakfast is good. The location is out of the center but managable with metro. very clean,  wonderful, helpful staff.
Was too noisy. Everyone is smashing the doors ALL night. For me it's common sens tombe quiet and hold the door when someone is sleeping. As well the noise of the street was terrible, people drunk were screaming. The guy under my bed, was moving a LOT, I couldn't sleep. At midnight I went to the reception to ask another room. They helped me. Was better but I slept only 3 hours in the night. Paying 30$ to sleep 3h and be tired the day after.. what a shame ! Our room didn’t have a window at all, and no AC, so it got really hot in there. I asked the front desk and they said if I came back to the front desk at 11 pm they might be able to find us another fan to put in there. I just let it go but it was pretty uncomfortable. Other rooms that had windows had beautiful Juliette balconies with French doors though, so I bet those were nice. It was great to have our own Tv though. Rare for a hostel! Also, the WiFi is only free downstairs travel shop, not free in the rooms. check-in was a farce. On arrival the staff (well-meaning and cheerful, but basically residents volunteering) couldn’t/wouldn’t allow any check-ins except via the hotels unique cellphone “app”. I was compelled to connect my phone to their local unsecured network, download their custom software to run on my phone, and sign up to their social media system (including compulsory selfie, and scan of my passport sent to the net) before I could get my room key! This of course took 14 minutes to complete, instead of the usual “hi, I booked with Expedia, here’s my passport” “welcome, here’s your key” system that works everywhere else in the world. But there are so many things wrong with the way they force untrusted software onto my personal phone and require the social logins before I was allowed my bed, it was shocking. King room bathroom ceiling cracked started to cave in, mould spots from humidity, plus I left my android tablet in room when checked out and when back to get it it's not there. General staff a good but don't just house keeping that they didn't find it Great location. Easy access to tourist sites and good restaurants since it is located in the Auckland city center. The staff were very nice and friendly. Full of rugby hooligans who came in at four am waking everyone one. No one else there was open to conversation or connecting. Spoke to others that have had the same experience there too. We had a private room with ensuite. The room has zero air circulation, it was extremely hot. It was also very, very noisy on the level. Each time someone opened and closed the door we could hear it clearly. It was a huge bang every time. The walls are paper thin. In the evenings the club is pumping and has music blaring through the walls. We could barely sleep. Nice and friendly staff but the bed is too small Excellent location. Good value for money. Not the quietest hostels if you need somewhere to catch up on rest... noise carries along the corridors when doors get slammed and the outside street can be noisy I booked a private room for two. It was clean. The location was good. My bed had bed bugs. The room was just dirty and smelly too, as there was not even a fan. The staff where mainly a bunch of hungover kids. Pros In central city Cheap accommodation   Cons Check-in took ages Room had no window. Wish this was mentioned earlier It was very close to everything. Sadly they shut the kitchen in the morning so I couldn't get a coffee before leaving. I didn't see this written anywhere and staff didn't care. I wouldn't recommend the 6th floor as there is noise ALL night from the kitchen above. I booked a room with twin beds at Nomads Backpackers and rang them to confirm our booking of twin beds. However when we got there, the room had a double bed only, not twin beds. Nomads staff, not very helpful, and could not change our booking - advising us that we booked a double bed - very disappointed in that facet of our accomodation. Location was great though, about a 5 minute walk from Queens Wharf I've stayed here before and will stay here again. Close to downtown and the ferry terminal and a good place for a short stay in Auckland, especially if you're doing any of the big bus tours around the country. The manager, Laura, is a sweetheart and super nice, always willing to help with anything that you need. If you want a quiet place... It is not the place but it is really well located for backpackers. My room was  on Fort St side. The hostel is located literally next door to a club that likes to play obnoxious loud music until 4 am. You also don't have air conditioning so you can choose between dying from heat exposure and closing the window (this only helped so much with the noise) or leaving the window open and hearing people talking, sirens and street noise and techno music until you want to bash your head in. This is also a dry hostel so no alcohol can be brought onto the premise. I choose it trying to save a few bucks, learn from my mistake and pick a different place to sleep. We have stayed 4 times at Nomads and the experience varied greatly. On this occasion the mattress was very thin, making for a very uncomfortable sleeping experience. The TV channels still haven't been fixed and you can only receive 2 channels, TV1 and Sky Sport1. Also the windows on the fifth floor have a concrete facade in front of them, limiting sunlight and view. Overall, this visit has me questioning whether I'd rebook. Room we stayed in kimg bed w ensuite was advertised at 70$/per night . got charged 116$ One staffember in particular was quite rude, in the ignoring type of way. The place is quite run down. I know its a back packers but mouldy grubby showers and stained thread bare carpet cannot be good for peoples health. We did lose our room.key and the lady who helped us was lovely though! Very helpful. On arrival we found our private double bed room was in the centre of the building and had no windows! It was extremely small and quite claustrophobic. Fortunately the staff were excellent and changed rooms for us. I can't speak for the quality of the dorms, but the communal kitchen was well equipped. The staff were very helpful in other matters also. Kitchen too small for the amount of people and my food has disappeared even if I labeled it. Cleanliness wasn't very a priority (kitchen bathroom showers and my room was a mess) No wifi no spa like the photo/description says. Friendly staff, rooms ok, maintenance looked they were rushed haha but cute with remote and towels laid out on bed --- great location Got to our room and there were clothes left there from before us. Guy at front desk was a bit rude. Windows wouldn't close room dirty. BAd smell in room and towels had holes in them. Very welcome check-in, good feel buzzing with travellers kitchen facilities looked good although I didn't need to make use of them but plenty of other guests were. We booked our stay 4 months in advance. We paid $106 for an ensuite room. Bedding was not as booked, room had an unpleasant smell and TV did not work. We feel this was extremely overpriced. Would happily have paid around $60 for this. We stayed another 4 nghts in Auckland and paid less per night for a spacious hotel room fully serviced, of similar location. Close to Queen Street and Britomart. Staff were friendly. As for the room. Sound proofing is needed. A bathmat for the ensuite wouldve been good. At the very least, clearing the rubbish bin in the room shouldve been done each day. Good otherwise. Its really basic. Backpackers mainly though i had a tiny king size bed room. So it was ok. Tiny bathroom n toilet area. Hardly anyone can fit into it. Absolutely horrible. I will never use an Orbitz referral again. In fact I will not use Orbitz for any vacation plans again
I've stayed here a number of times. It's a very good standard hotel, with all the basics done right. The staff is excellent: attentive, friendly and supportive. The rooms, restaurant and overall facility are very good. Definitely recommended. We found this priced very competitively , but now we know why, as it's very remote. You must have a car or be prepared to use the tram which is a 10+ minute walk each way. This time only stayed one night to catch a flight from Leipzig airport Clean , big, confortable room,  very good breakfast, good internet connection. Clean hotel with uptodate rooms. Tub a bit old but very good. No clock radio and no safe in room. Good restaurant, helpful and friendly staff. Abot 20-25 euro cab ride to downtown This is a typical business hotel located in the suburbs away front the city center. If you have your own transportation and don't  need to walk to destinations, it is an excellent choice. Great buffet breakfast.
Pleasant & welcoming registration staff. The room was newly renovated with a contemporary décor. The heating and cooling ventilation is individually controlled in the room and efficient. A generous buffet breakfast is offered. The hotel is located on a pedestrian street within easy walking distance to most sites, restaurants and retail. I found no need to use mass transit; a subway station is about two blocks away. Because of luggage, I hired a taxi from the Atocha train station to the hotel for less than 5 Euros. I will stay here again on future visits. We returned to Madrid after almost two weeks of tooling around Barcelona and then the south of Spain (Granada and Sevilla). We were staying in modest accommodations the entire time, small rooms no frills. Francisco charged us around the same prices as these small no frills places, however when we checked in we saw it was a cut above. Again, we don't spend money on 5 star hotels but still the lobby was hip and sleek, the elevators were fast and efficient and the room was quite large, with a beautiful and wildly comfortable king bed. Francisco is located el Centro, very close to Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor so it's incredibly convenient. The staff was delightful and helpful. My only criticism is that the room was a bit chilly and I think that could be easily fixed. I would also suggest that not only Francisco, but every hotel in Spain include a small Keurig or electric kettle so guests can make a cup of coffee in the morning. The hotel's buffet was a little too pricey for our speed. Other than those two small things I highly recommend Francisco The Hotel itself is very central. We booked the hotel because it was central and we liked the rooms that were shown on the web site. However the room we were given was not like the modern rooms that had been shown, it was dark, tired and very basic with no coffee or tea making facilities, it did not look anything like the photos on the web site either. The worst thing was the noise, according to the staff because of the time of year you can only heat the room not cool it, so the only way to cool the room was to have the window open, boy do they like to party late in Madrid, over the weekend they were still partying loudly until 06:00. Construction was going on in the room next to me the first night so was woken up by loud hammering and banging. I arrived a day early so had a separate reservation for one night and then moved to my new room the next day. The walls are VERY thin so you can hear every footstep above and below you. Rather than construction, the next day was woken up by the cleaning people yelling down the halls to each other. Soon after that a cleaning lady let herself into my room without even knocking, glad I was at least decent. Two days into my stay, I left the hotel for a few hours and upon return, while waiting for the elevator was then accused by a front desk person of not staying here, making me reconfirm my room. On a positive note, the rooms and bathroom were good sized, it was in a great location, and the beds were very comfortable. That said, I would not stay there again. Small modern hotel on a very active street, with a short walk to main plaza. Lots of people out for their daily evening walks. A 15-20 walk to the Royal Palace and the grand cathedral. This boutique hotel is on one of the main pedestrian streets in the old part of the city. The continuous noise outside the window is not for everyone - shoppers, party-goers and rubbish trucks althrough the night. The rooms are clean but, very small. There were no other fasciities the hotel offered. This hotel was in an ideal location close to lots of sites and public transportation. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was a very good value for the price. We would highly recommend this hotel. The front desk was very helpful! Jarvi ( I think that was his name) was very helpful, accommodating to our needs, he personally came up to our room to show us how the work the heater The hotel has recently been renovated to a very high standard. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. We did not eat breakfast but it was buffet style and there seemes to be plenty on offer. The location was very central plenty of shops bars and restaurants close by. Local sightseeing attractions close by or not too far if you want to walk about 20 mins Royal Palace. Would definately stay again Absolutely excellent location. The staff was extremely helpful & knowledgeable. The room was smaller and not as chic as represented in the online pics. But overall a definite must stay at This hotel was fantastic. In the middle of the city center, we could walk to everything. As Americans who do not speak much Spanish, this made it very easy to find restaurants and sites without much difficulty. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. From bringing in our bags, to helping with reservations for dinner, or just a warm greeting when we came in and out. They were very professional and yet still welcoming. They have the right balance. Our room was absolutely spectacular!! We stayed on the 6th floor which as renovated in December. Very, very clean and modern. We had a terrace that overlooked the city. The perfect views of exactly what you hope when you go to Europe. Stunning old buildings, bell towers, and a stone street with all kinds of people outside. Simply perfect. The room had every amenity you could need, plenty of sitting areas, and a very comfortable bed. The only strange thing in the room is the glass door to the bathroom. This was not a problem for us, as we have been married a long time. But it might be uncomfortable if you were staying with a friend. The hotel is currently under renovations to build a new lobby. The outside entrance at the moment is very unimpressive, to the point I thought what did I book? But when the new entrance and lobby are finished, it will be as nice as inside. The construction did not interfere or cause any inconvenience of any kind. A wonderful boutique hotel right in one of the best tourist sections of Madrid Beautiful, affordable boutique hotel. The staff went above and beyond. They noticed it was our birthday (my friend and I share the same bday) and they decorated our room with balloons and a card while we were out. They even gave us a bottle of champagne! Highly recommended We were on the 4th floor of this hotel for 2 nights facing the Calle del Arenal. The room was clean and comfortable but it was extremely loud at all hours of the day- literally people yelling from 11pm through 5am in the street and then delivery trucks, garbage trucks, etc from 5-8am. I would only suggest staying here if you can be guaranteed a room facing the back of the building. Also in the late morning/early afternoon the housekeeping team was moving around furniture which was very loud. we never got a break from noise. We stayed here during semana santa. About 30-45' from airport, traffic can be a challenge and during crowded afternoons and evenings you may have to walk a few blocks as the street in front of the hotel is a pedestrian mall and is closed to vehicle traffic during peak times. Staff was very attentive. Common areas of hotel are beautiful. We stayed in 4-person rooms, which are large and reasonably comfortable. During late March A/C not functioning, room did get a little stuffy and warm. Couldn't keep window open at night due to street noise. We got locked out of our room one Saturday evening when the door lock battery died. Cost us about an hour of time, but they did get someone over to fix it. Didn't try breakfast -- at 15 Euros/person very expensive for Spain. There's a good Starbucks a block away. Overall would happily stay here again. We much prefer this type of lodging over a big chain. Do be careful when walking around this area -- lots of pickpockets due to number of tourists. Keep wallets and cell phones inside zippered pockets or inside pockets of jackets. Clean modern and friendly. Bring ear plugs. Walls are thin. Great location. Great location, lovely staff, fantastic rooms, will use again, and would recommend.
As if you live in a 5 star hotel in any big cities in the world. Modern and nicely designed. Will be worth your money The end of June in a middle of a heatwave and no A/C! Not even at the lobby. Hotel seems nice but we couldn't bar to stay there a minute longer. Front desk was very rude and inconsiderate. Wouldn't recommend to stay there during  summer. Beautiful hotel in a great location. Quiet large rooms with nice modern bathroom. Breakfast buffet was delicious and varied and the view from the outdoor balcony was stunning. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to everyone Ok, but wellness area not as good as expected. Great breakfast. My fear of heights kicked in walking the bridge to the pool. Hot tub not hot, and accessed by ladder. Very comfortable hotel. The views are fantastic and the spa is top notch. Great for relaxing. The breakfast was very good, lots of choice. More than sufficient. The bed was very comfortable. While not close to the centre of Krems, it is about a 15 to 20 minutes walk from Stein, which has interesting plazas and good restaurants. For those who want to be close to the centre, this may not be the best choice. If you do not mind walking and being outside of the centre, this could be the place for you. We chose Krems in winter because we wanted to visit the nearby famous Christmas market at Grafenegg. The hotel room was lovely even though the hotel itself was more corporate in feeling than those we usually choose. Fantastic stay in Krems. Boat trip to Melke was scenic. Restaurants were of good quality. Loved the hotel. The pool area was wonderful. Food was also great Visited a winery. Very pretty area with all the vineyards and Danube. This is a very nice, very quiet hotel tucked away on the edge of Krems. It was a great base from which to explore the Danube River valley and ruins, and the hotel itself had nice accommodations for relaxing. It was also very quiet, even with the windows wide open at night.
it was the perfect tranquil place to celebrate my 80th birthday. We enjoyed our trips to the city, but loved coming back to the peace and beauty of the hotel. Only wish we had more time here. We have been all over the world and we would rate this hotel among our favorites. The gardens are peaceful, the restaurant was fantastic, service was impeccable and our pool suite was decorated so beautifully and provided a wonderful respite. Only negative is that it is far out from the old medina but they do provide a shuttle. Can't say enough about this beautiful place. Magical gardens, loved to see the veg plots and fruit trees. Beautiful hotel, attentive staff and delicious food. No wifi in room and sun beds a little awkward - only negatives in what was still a 10/10 hotel experience. We’d recommend to friends and would love to stay again. Charming place with many intimate spaces. Lovely garden, each room has a different feel. Very good breakfast. A place for families and group of friends. Went for quick “fly & flop” break. Hotel lovely with quirky rooms, nice public areas and great restaurants and very good staff. Access to pool was tricky as no conventional steps or ladder just very large 1.5 ft steps forming a series of graduations into the water. Not ideal for everyone. Transfers from airport Ian’s into town available (at a cost) and free shuttle bus 3 times a day. Our experience at this hotel was excellent from the moment we arrived until our departure. The staff went out of their way to ensure that we had everything we needed and beyond. The junior suite was beautiful with its own patio area and outdoor four poster bed. The food was all freshly cooked and the waiters checked every single time that it met my needs as I am gluten/lactose intolerant. The most beautiful hotel and the staff were brilliant. Will certainly return as soon as possible Main restaraunt could possibly do with extending the menu during the week. What a beautiful boutique hotel, just far enough away from the maddening crowd. The hotel lays on a shuttle bus if you prefer the noise, otherwise this was a really tranquil and pleasing space. The peacocks on the garden made it all the more worthwhile. Will definitely come back. A bientou An easy ten minute ride out of Marrakech central, this is a real oasis. Impeccable service, stunning interiors and incredibly tranquil. Can't wait to get back there. A perfect getaway where we were able to relax and enjoy a beautiful environment and great service. The local staff in particular are so warm,  friendly and hospitable. We had eight nights in this lovely hotel. Extremely friendly and helpful staff - faultless - it is a professionally, well run and very relaxed family hotel with a lovely atmosphere. Beautiful gardens and swimming pool. Excellent breakfasts, lunches and dinners. We had a slight problem with the plumbing in our bathroom and a little bit of maintenance required around pool area, but we would certainly return and highly recommend the hotel. A beautiful relaxing oasis just outside of Marrakech. Lovely grounds, pool and spa. Great food too! We absolutely loved our visit to Les Deux Tours. We had planned to stay two nights and ended up staying for 5 nights. The hotels is situated in 7 acres of beautiful gardens. The staff are lovely and warm. Big smiles all around. The best service. The pool is amazing. It was our second visit. This time to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We will be back! ! This is a unique property with beautiful architecture and grounds. The service was excellent, with very good recommendations for a guide and restaurants. It's walled off from the outside, which is very poor; but that was okay. The WiFi needs to be more reliable, and I prefer to have a good iron in my room rather than sharing a bad iron with other hotel guests. Overall we had a great time here. A lovely hotel in a peaceful location away from the madness of Marrakech. We stayed in a junior suite which was beautiful. The included breakfast is excellent , and the evening meals we ate in the restaurant were wonderful. Staff were great. Altogether a wonderful experience. We will return . Relaxing stay away from the hussle & bussle of the main city. lovely people lovely place! a rare find a rare gem!
This hotel is very nice and comfortable. The breakfast is well worth it and the hotel bar and food were excellent! Sneem seems like a great town to stay in if it wasn't January and everything was shut down, but the hotel made it worth the stay with the great sea view. The spa (a home jacuzzi tub) in the basement wasn't working but I wouldnt' have used it anyways. I loved the location as it made the Ring of Kerry a perfect day trip to start and return from! My wife and I stayed here for a week and found everything about this hotel to be excellent. On arrival we were upgraded to a better room with sea and mountain views which was a great start. All of the staff were so friendly and couldn't help you enough. The breakfast was exceptionally good, especially on the days we ordered off the menu rather than the buffet. The hotel is in a great location for expiring the ring of Kerry as it is pretty centrally located to Valentia Island and Killarney. All in all it was a great stay and we will definitely be staying here again when in the area. Lovely quiet hotel with large comfortable room and beautiful setting. This was a great starting point for our driving tour of the Ring of Kerry. The only negative was adequately warm but not hot water. A high quality hotel a few minutes walk from a lovely picturesque village. It was an easy drive and a relaxing atmosphere. We would definitely come back again! Overall clean and very comfortable with excellent staff Beautiful property. Gem of the Ring of Kerry! We upgraded to the sea view and it was so beautiful. Good breakfast too. Big comfortable bed with plenty of pillows and a fantastic view. Very quiet, not disturbed by noise in other rooms. Fantastic view from breakfast room. The hot tub wasn't working when we visited, and they clear away some breakfast items before 9.30am and breakfast is served until 10, but this is only a tiny negative and could easily be improved on. Overall the best hotel we stayed in during our week in Ireland. This hotel turned out to be one of the unexpected highlights of a three week trip touring the U.K. and Ireland. It is beautifully located, the rooms are massive and comfortable, and it is smack bang in the middle of beautiful Kerry. I can't recommend it highly enough Perfect hotel for a family holiday Great location for the ring of Kerry trip Beautiful setting! The hotel is very nice and clean, comfortable rooms. Excellent staff. Great food. It was a wonderful stay! The rooms were very pleasant and I was impressed by their size. All the staff very helpful and polite. The breakfast was plentyful and tasty. Room was beautiful and comfortable! Lovely views! Breakfast excellent! Lovely big room, comfortable bed and great shower. Buffet breakfast with a good choice of food. The view from the room looking over the river and mountains was amazing. The grounds were lovely to walk around, and in the summer the terrace outside would be the perfect place to sit and relax. Just a few minutes walk into town for restaurants, bars and shops. The only negatives were that the carpet was showing signs of wear (appears stained in places), although everything else was spotless, and although the wifi worked very well in the evening, it wouldn't work in the morning. It did the job. 1 night's stay while doing ring of Kerry. But was definitely not on par with other 4 stars we have  had the pleasure of staying in. View looked into parking with construction vehicle standing out like a sore thumb, bath was cracked around plughole giving the impression it was dirty. Hotel did not have a comfortable feel to it. Generally prefer hotels to guesthousesbut next time would look for a guesthouse in the area rather as the hotel lacked ambience. Front desk was very pleasant & quick check-in. Kind of in the middle of nowhere.. Room average-a little worn. Fantastic stay! I really enjoyed it. Wonderful staff, food and scenery. I love coming here? The hotel is fabulous great location to the small town, we were lucky enough to have a room with a view which qas stunning. The service in the bar area and also at breakfast nothing was too much trouble and the food was delicious. Would definitely recommend. Fabulous stay in this  very comfortable hotel....great views and lovely village nearby The hotels fitness center was definitely not worth paying the extra money to stay. The cross trainer and treadmill were both in-operational. There was no water, towels or cleansing cloths in the fitness center either, what a joke. The front desk was notified the first day and took no action to fix. We asked to speak to the manager, and they did not respond back to us. Great stay in a beautiful location Nice hotel ,pity no pool.Breakfast was great{hope the black pudding was from Sneem]. Breakfast up to 11 perfect. Comfort and excellent friendly service Only complaint was the room smelt of pot Wonderful experience! Beautiful hotel in a quaint, picturesque setting. The rooms were large and comfortable, and the view was wonderful The rooms are enormous, clean and the service within the hotel was excellent. We were treated extremely wellas soon as we arrived. The lobby is lovely, warm and inviting. You feel like you are in a beautiful lodge with modern amenties. The scenery is truly lovely. Plenty of parking.
Excellent location, in city center and we feel safe. Staff is nice and friendly. However, the apartment above us was having party well beyond midnight. We have elderly and young children in the group. With all the singing and dancing (more like thumping), no one had good rest. Since the property doesn't have full time staff (9am-6pm), we really couldn't get the help we needed to stop the madness. I would not recommend any light sleepers to stay at this property. This apartment is totally recommendable.The apartment is of a good size, where a family of  5 can stay very comfortably. The one i got had 2 bedrooms,  living room with a sofa bed, small dining area and an equipped kitchen - microwave, Krups coffee machine, a regular coffee brewer, toaster , pots and pans, cutleries. Free tea and coffee too, so we made use of the coffee pods . Everything is provided for including  dishsoap, sponge , sugar, salt and pepper, cups, glasses and plates. A big plus is the washer/ dryer in one, (oddly) situated in the kitchen. The receptionist was nice, we arrived at 10 am and we were able to leave out luggages in a holding room as check-in was not until 3pm. We were luckily allowed to chk in early - at around 12 noon. She also gave us a map of the area and pointed out to us the key areas we should visit plus the subway stations nearby. The apartment is really situated in a prime location, a few steps to La Rambla and Gothic Quarter. We frequented those areas everyday. There were also a lot of restos along the street of Carrer Nou la Rambla. One thing that i may need to point out to management is, the master bedroom had 2 single beds joined together. I think one of the beds - when the mattress misaligns with the bedframe, one of the wooden slats fall to the floor. This happened twice. This may need to be looked at my management. Very good location if you are into lively outdoors on La Rambla. The staff was quite friendly and helpful and even helped me extend my sta, especially since it was active Summer period. The rooms were comfortable. One room with Queen bed and a a bunk bed in another room for the kids. Close proximity to the sea, La Boqueria market, Plaza Catalunya and metro stations. Lots of options in the proximity for food. Also, it is right across Palau Guell. Excellent staff who went out of their way to help with everything; spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable apartment; central location, ideally placed. Nice balcony to sit on in the evening. Very central location. Nice sitting area and kitchen. Appartment was spotlessly clean and the staff very helpful. Great communication before we got there and helpful once arrived. Use their taxi service to save yourself €5! Would definitely stay here again I was very happy there for my 4 day stay Just off the main Las Ramblas but no noise and apartment immaculate. Would definitely recommend. Will sleep 6 as a sofa bed, plus a double and 2 singles in our apartment. I rented specifically an apartment unit with 3 large bedrooms and a small 4th bedroom, and 3 bathrooms for a family for 6. The apartment can hold 10 people and is fully furnished with beds, kitchen appliances, furniture, etc. We were right in front of Palau Guell and 1 minute walk from Las Ramblas. The reception personnel was very polite, helped with  questions and reservations, and spoke English and Spanish. Recommended for large families. It was great experience. The location was great, close to everything in Barcelona. The receptionist was exceptionally helpful. Everything was perfect starting from the check-in to the check-out Comfortable apartment in a great location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Lovely sun terrace. Large rooms and great location to walk to waterfront and plenty of restaurants Very Close to La Rambla. Good central location. Staff was very friendly and helpful. very good apartment. the location was great, next to placa reial. 3 minutes from two metro stations. Great Bohemian apartment. Perfect location to Plaza Reial in La Rambla area. Very friendly and professional staff. It's no frills, but we enjoyed the patio and it was nice with 2 bedrooms and 2 baths. Very nice suite in a convenient location. 1st time in Barcelona with the family and the apt was not only in a great location but it was also a great place. The staff was very helpful and very professional. I would recommend this without any hesitation. Location is perfect , service and welcome are excellent  Bed and mattress are not confortable and need to be renovated
Excellent small hotel tucked away just minutes from the train station. Clean, friendly and in a magnificent location to explore this “hidden gem” of a city. Ideal for a stopover transit hotel, flying into or out of Malaga. Only minutes from the airport and trains and transport links are second to none. £33 for a twin room, well it was a steal. Booked up already to stay again for my property hunt in the city and area. I had a comfortable stay. The room was basic but clean and comfortable. The hotel is convenient for the station and it is easy enough to get to the city centre. There is no lift access at the street level, which was not a problem for me, but I had to carry my luggage up a short staircase. Centrally located and reasonably priced hotel with friendly straff. Breakfast was served in a different hotel a few minutes walk away. It's a comfortable hotel, convenient to local attractions. The room was small but clean and functional. Desk service was very good. There is actually no breakfast at the hotel, rather it's at another property three blocks away. The neighborhood is OK, though not attractive. Easy Helpful staff Clean room Air conditioning in our room The air conditioning didn't work. Only had a ceiling fan and it made a ton of noise. Did the trick for the night though but there are definitely better hotels for the same price. Charging us Euro 3.72 for one local phone call from the reception as we could not make a local call from the room phone . I have never encountered this in my travels. Have used this hotel previously due to its convenient location to the train and bus stations. Ideal, well priced, comfortable small hotel. Extremely pleasant staff  Extremely clean room Two very long twin beds were very firm  Very close to train station  Was a great bargain compared to other hotels in town Wi-Fi weak in the room But fine downstairs
The mattress was so worn it sank in at the middle making it impossible to sleep on my side due to the bow. Both the hot and cold water leaks at the faucet in the tub and the hot water was dangerously hot. The tub did not drain well and at the end of every shower, I stood in inches of water. The room smelled musty when we first walked in and we opened windows. The next day after returning from sight-seeing, the room still smelled musty when we entered. When I reserved it, the website stated it as the only room available at the hotel so I could not just move to another room. An anniversary of the million man march was going on at the same time. We had a lovey experience. My boyfriend and I came down to see the Cherry Blossoms and this hotel was is a great location. Just hop on the city bike and you’re there in mins. Comfortable bed, brand new bathrooms. We also were given a room with a kitchen which was a great plus! The hotel has a great restaurant for breakfast right downstairs. The only cons I’d have to say was I guess I didn’t read closely and the price for parking was $46 per night. Yes you were able to take car in and out without charge I just thought that was super pricey. And outside one entrance to the building were some homeless ppl living in their tents, but they didn’t bother anybody. Yes I would stay again! Very comfortable and spacious room and bathroom. The small kitchen room  was extremely convenient. I felt like the kitchen and dishes could have been cleaner, though. My biggest complaint is that the refrigerator was extremely loud. At first I thought the laundry room was next to mine, but then I realized it was the refrigerator. It kept me up the first night and I turned it off for the second night. My only other complaint is that the door did not have an extra security chain or bar to stop someone with a key from opening it. That made me uncomfortable as a woman travelling alone. Great hotel. Only negative is the building is either entirely in heating mode or cooling mode. Thus if the building is in heating mode (as it was during my visit as it was early April) you have no air conditioning in your room. I like things on the cool side so this was a problem until I realized I could open the windows and get a nice flow of cool air into the room. Problem solved. My room (all rooms?) have a small kitchen with a refrigerator/freezer, microwave and some plates/glasses/silverware. Hotel has very good proximity to the national mall if you don't mind a little walking. There is a subway station about 1/3 mile away and lots of restaurant options. George Washington U is immediately to the north. I did plenty of walking around the entire area and always felt safe. I would stay at the State Plaza again. The bathroom looked newly renovated and clean. The high-power showerhead was amazing and felt like a rain shower. The bed was soft and comfortable. Our room had a small kitchen, which came in handy with an infant. They allowed us to check in early and even kept our bags after checkout so that we could continue to explore the city. A close walk to the Metro, Whole Foods, the White House, and the Lincoln Memorial. We had a great stay. Last minute booked here when my flight got canceled out of DC. Staff was great, hotel room was nice, in a great area. A couple blocks to the foggy bottom Metro stop and lots of great restaurants within walking distance Good Location, easy to get to activities. Rooms larger than regular hotel with mini kitchens. Parking is only in small garage with a 6'7 clearance so larger trucks and SUVs may have a problem. Kid of a no frills hotel, rooms were clean, staff friendly, CVS and ABC store next door. Just nothing fancy, you wont be excited about staying here but you'll be comfortable. The room and the stuff was excelente. But we have problem with the parking. Nobody told us that it cost 46 dollars per Day!!!! I will not return, I dont like that they didnt mentioned this information at the revew. Very nice hotel, gorgeous cafe, all within walking distance of highlights offered in DC. The tent city across from the hotel was not pleasant and could be a reason we would not come back. Great value, plenty of space and good location. Nextdoor to CVS, very convenient Nice location convenient to Kennedy Center and the Mall After making a booking mistake, Expedia and the hotel resolved the issue. They were accommodating to our needs and we had a pleasant stay. The room was clean, comfortable and big. It had a kitchen & breakfast nook which were a bonus. The hotel was near to the attractions we wanted to see. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. The hotel is very well situated for mall visits. Access to transportation is handy. The room(s) are spacious, and have been updated recently. A full kitchen is so handy for folks like us who prefer to eat lite meals after a full day of touring. For an extended stay requirement, this is your hotel in our opinion. Clean chick  great food. Close to everything. Bus tours, Tidal Basin, etc. great hotel close to down town DC I was very conftable and very much appreciate the upgrade to the one bedroom suite I would never stay there again the parking rate is a giant reply $46 a night absurd. Also the area is run down and  With homeless sleeping right across the street from the hotel. Good location with minimal traffic noise from rooms on the side, very clean and great beds and pillows. This is an excellent hotel if you have family. The kitchenette has all you need. Plus, Whole Foods is just 3 blocks away. It has a great location too.... a few blocks away from Washington Monument. What clean, spacious rooms! The bathroom was spotless, the linens and carpet all clean, and my goodness-there is so much space in this room! The rooms are converted apartments. The small kitchenette was surprising but useful (so we could save some money by eating breakfast in the room). As others mentioned, the kitchenette wasn't quite as spotless as the bathroom but still clean. (I can't imagine what the cleaning protocol might look like for a hotel filled with kitchenettes that may or may not be used each time.) We loved the location--walkable to the National Museum of African American History and Culture (our main reason for visiting) as well as the Lincoln Memorial, Georgetown, the White House, even the Capitol. (We walked a lot!) The GWU neighborhood means there are always people around, even late at night, and there are a number of quick and healthy eateries between the hotel and the Foggy Bottom metro stop. Will return! My fiance and I stayed at the State Plaza Hotel to celebrate his birthday. It's a very nice hotel and we had a nice stay. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the parking. When I called ahead, I was told the options were valet, street parking and a nearby parking garage. Turns out the garage is only open during weekdays and it was pretty crazy in DC at the time so we had to valet. It wasn't that big of a hiccup for our weekend, but I think it's something to keep in mind when you visit. But it's a very nice hotel and the price was great! People at the front desk every shift were very helpful. ILost my glasses I did not find them but they tried very hard to find them always looking and asking. Very nice people to deal with, they were always smiling. I would give a one star! I would have given at least a 4 star but unfortunately the room did not cool below 76 degrees the maintenance said that it won’t cool any further and gave us a fan instead for night time use! It’s unacceptable! We will not stay again unless the management guarantees this thermostat issue. It was terrible! No frills but very reasonable for location.Cute kitchen, full fridge, stove and little table. Staff very friendly but note you have to walk outside through garage  to other building to little restaurant or gym Perfect. If you don't need a huge lobby and a huge gym with a DC view, this is a place for you. Restaurant has good food and the rooms are comfortable (again no view). Gym is tiny  and at the basement but you are at a perfect location so just go walking the city :) Very clean spacious rooms, friendly staff, great location,  a little long for valet service but they were a bit understaffed and tried their best and still worth it Temperature too hot! Great area. Easy to walk to monuments, White house, restaurants.....the room was comfortable, clean, nice- very nice. Wonderful stay- this is our second stay- once as a couple- th esecond time as a family. Appreciate its proximity to everything- and overall very nice, comfortable stay! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at State Plaza Hotel. The employees were very friendly -- some of the best we've encountered anywhere. We stayed in a renovated section of the hotel and it was like having our own apartment in D.C. It was great to have a small kitchen and an eating area. The bed was comfortable however, the pillows were luxurious, but a bit thick for our taste. The Metro stop was about .4 mile from the hotel within the campus of George Washington University. We could stop at Whole Foods on our walk to the hotel too! If we are back in D.C we would certainly stay at State Plaza. My granddaughter and I stayed at State Plaza Hotel for 3 nights during our March 2017 sightseeing trip to DC. The hotel has a very good location for public transportation. It's near the corner of Virginia and E St., which has a Metrobus stop and is only 4 blocks to the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metro Station. We were able to easily reach all of the National Mall, monuments, museums, Chinatown, etc. from there. It is near the heart of the George Washington University Campus (interesting for my teen granddaughter to see) and the GWU Hospital. The only downside for some might be the frequent ambulance and police sirens because of the location but it didn't disturb our rest. Next door is a liquor store and a 24-hour CVS. Nearby there's a public-accessible GWU student area, with a Dunkin Donuts,  Baskin Robbins, Pita Pit and Potbelly Sandwiches. The hotel has a Garden Café which is very nice. They offered large salads, fish & chips, chicken quesadilla, pasta Bolognese, crab cakes and more. Good quality, fresh tastes, nice atmosphere, quiet. They had a bar and a selection of dinner wines. Prices were neither inexpensive nor extravagant for DC. While the building itself seems older, our bathroom/room was very bright and clean, modern, tastefully decorated and had a very comfortable bed. Modern elevator, if somewhat slow. Bottled water is delivered to your room each evening with a note wishing you a peaceful rest. Nice touch. Great staff. Would be very happy to stay here again. This was our first visit to D.C. and the hotel has a great location for getting around. Its a short walk to the hop-on-hop-off buses, the Metro, the White House, the National Mall, and many of the must-see sites and monuments. The hotel mini-suite was comfortable and very clean, the entire staff was friendly and cordial, and the hotel restaurant was excellent, there is a fitness center for guest - nothing negative about the State Plaza. The only things missing, which is not the fault of the hotel, was a grocery store (a nearby drug store and convenience store offer some items) and the lack of good restaurants within walking distance in the evening. We would recommend the State Plaza to anyone looking for comfort and a hotel that is a cut-above. Should we return to D.C., we would definitely consider the State Plaza. I have stayed here in the past and was very satisfied. This visit I was very impressed with the staff. Whatever I needed they were there for me. Very personable, professional, and friendly. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. It is away from downtown so is quiet. It is a short 4-5 block walk downhill to the Lincoln Memorial end of the Mall. I was there to re-visit the Vietnam Memorial...the Wall. I would stay there again any time I am in D.C. The room was nice until I sat on the couch. It had a bad odor. Took things into my own hands went next door as there is a 24 hr CVS. Got febreeze & air freshener. Took care of the problem but obviously sprayed to much.Housekeeping came by with 2 bottles of hot water & shortly after that security was at the door wanting to know if we were smoking. We assume they thought we were trying to mask smoke when in fact we were masking the odor on the couch! We didn't put it all together until later. When I tried to talk to them about it they were rude & laughed when we walked off. The next day after sightseeing we get back to our room @4:30 & it had not been cleaned when we ask about it they ask if we had the do not disturb sign on the door . We didn't. Tried to have a drink at the Garden Cafe which is part of the hotel while we waited on our room. No Corona beer & no margarita salt. More concerned if we were guest there. Waited outside for an hour for our room to be cleaned. The night before the Garden Cafe was out of fish & chips. They did have them  the next night....big disappointment anyway. I will say the king size bed was very comfortable. They did call us & as to talk about the review I had left on their Facebook page. They didn't seem to concerned about talking to me when I tried the 1st time so I didn't see any need wasting my time. Especially after the way they acted when I tried to speak with them the first time! I will say the king size bed was very comfortable. We stayed at the State Plaza Hotel while in DC for the Marine Corp Marathon. Everything was great - loved the layout of the room. Friendly staff, in-house restaurant, close to CVS, Metro and National Mall. Great place to stay if attending a show at the Kennedy Center. Nice room. Large bathroom. Very clean, comfortable room that was centrally located for our needs Wonderful, attentive staff. Quiet room. Comfortable bed. Close to Metro, restaurants and National Mall. Originally booked because it used to be the apartment building I lived in 50 years ago as a student at GWU. Everything looked familiar. Nice efficiency with workable kitchen. Clean friendly staff. Short walk to two Metro stations. Great location, great staff Starbucks dunkin donuts not door. Easy to walk to mall or metro. Wonderful room. So clean and comfortable. Only drawback is that the ad mentioned the room had a fridge and it didn't. Fantastic location for sightseeing in DC and for visiting GWU. The hotel itself was nice--we had a room with a king bed, small kitchenette and table, desk, dressing area and bathroom. Large room with plenty of space. Restaurant has a nice outdoor shaded courtyard. Located just about 10 minutes walk from Metro, Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and White House (depending on which direction you choose to go. Right beside The George Washington University. The staff was helpful with all requests and the room was very comfortable. The room we checked into was arguably the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The living room was enormous, the dining room comfortable. the kitchen spacious enough (although the lighting in the kitchen needed improvement), the shower hot and strong, and the king-sized bed in the large living room extremely comfortable. Foggy Bottom Station was a 5 - 10 minute walk away, so it was very convenient, and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Nice hotel in good location. Close to National Mall, White House etc. Wonderful room with a kitchen. Very clean as well. Loved my stay here. Spacious room. Comfortable bed. Afternoon was very warm and there was no ac. I complained and they comped the car storage fee. It's $48 a day to store your car. Located on GW University. Several places to eat nearby. Rooms nice, clean. Maid service and front desk staff excellent. Rates great for location. It was ok, we'll taken care friendly staff No handicap access We had a great stay. The staff was exceptionally friendly and the rooms were all very clean. It is also a great location. Very close to everything, including walking distance of the metro. Very nice. Close to the National Mall. Not able to easily handle luggage. I stayed here for one night and had terrible experience with noise level. Did not sleep all night as there were people on the floor yelling and talking till 4 am! Sounded like a trashy party next door. Told the manager next am and she had no explanation. Nor did she bother to look into it and respond back to me. Bathtub was disgustingly dirty like no one bothered to scrub it down. I just needed a night sleep and did not even get that. Great location! Very accommodating and safe! I will definitely be staying here again. The bellhop guy was very polite and very accommodating. The front desk people were also very nice. It's close to some monuments and Uber is not to bad to use. We basically walked to the Capital and back with no problem. Friendly staff cleans and comfortable room. Thanks. Hotel was clean and close to everything, bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable to sleep on. So called breakfast buffet was the same cold croissants and danish every day. I was there 3 nights. It was clean Nice 4 nights staying here, location is close to everything in the heart of GW university, staff is nice, hotel is somewhat old, but clean and servicable, certainly a good dead for the money in comparision. This is my third stay here this summer. Haven't been disappointed once. Reggie is wonderful! We were in DC to sight - see. Read reviews on this hotel and felt for the location it was the best choice. And we were right! ! I would recommend this hotel to any one. Staff is wonderful, professional and friendly. All is clean and cared for. Perfect for those who are in town for a while and want to use an in suite kitchen instead of eating out. The room was clean and spacious. Walking distance to many site seeing attractions. Loved the hotel Would strongly recommend that you stay here Really good size rooms with decent bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. On checking in and throughout the stay staff were very welcoming and attentive. Room was clean, large, bright and also an upgrade with a kitchen. A short walk to Foggy Bottom station warranted a weekly SmarTrip card which was well used. The walks to the National Mall with its grand, amazing monuments and museums were experiences we will never forget. A must stay that we would highly recommend to anyone. Fantastic location within walking distance of all the main attractions. Amenities were minimal, however, we did use the restaurant and the food was delicious. Our room was cleaned to a very high standard everyday. The hotel is fairly quiet which was nice (we did have a room at the end of a corridor). We were on our honeymoon and the staff arranged for some chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of fizz on arrival which was a lovely touch and very much appreciated. WiFi was a bit hit and miss (we had to keep reconnecting by signing back in) but no biggie as were not staying for business purposes. Overall a very nice stay and would definitely recommend.
Overall, it was great, just found getting access to pool a bit limited if you need to be there with a child. If you don't get there early and reserve a spot you most likely won't get a chair around the pool for the rest of the day. Don't like feeling that I have to race to the pool and grab a spot! It is not everyone who likes going to the beach, especially with children. Hotel staff were great, especially those at front desk and in the restaurant. Cleaning staff not very friendly though. I did lots of research and picked this hotel based on it being so close to the marina and I was not disappointed. The hotel itself only has rooms on the ground or 1st floor, so is spread over a large area  surrounding  2 marinas with the main entrance, pool and dining area in the middle. Should you need, staff drive around buggys that can pick up & drop you off anywhere within the complex which is especially handy when you are arriving or leaving with all your baggage . We booked B&B and the buffet style breakfast was of high standard with eggs cooked at request. There  was a small convienance shop opposite which had good prices for your essentials. I compared this to the top 5 in the area and I would choose the Tivoli again. Have just returned from fantastic holiday. Room overlooking the marina with nice big terrace (was ground floor). We were near the nightclub but wasn't disturbed by it (some others have said they were - we couldn't hear it). Room was cleaned every day. Within walking distance of amazing breakfast buffet and the pool. Love the cabanas around the pool. 5 minutes to the beach and restaurants and bars. All in all had a great time. Only things to improve on for me were the highchairs in the restaurant were old and broken and there only seemed to be one with straps for a smaller baby in the whole restaurant. Pool bar very slow for food and really small selection of ice creams. Would have been nice to have someone walking around pool serving drinks/ice creams - the two people in the towel hut were just sitting there most of the day with nothing to do. Finally didn't look like many people were having massages around the pool - prices were a bit too expensive for us. But these are small things that would have just made it even better. I made a mistake when booking, I thought I had the main hotel but it was the Marina Sun which is a block separated by part of the Marina. There were buggies to transfer you as at times it was very warm to walk - all the main activities and dining room were in the main part. The plus side was the room was lovely and comfortable, bigger than last year in the main area, there is a small pool which was lovely and not crowded. The downside the poolside refreshments did not open everyday and never in the mornings. The staff were friendly particularly the buggy drivers and most of the reception staff, there was a distinct lack of staff in the Marina Sun. The breakfasts were fabulous and this year the eggs were cooked to order, there was entertainment laid on. Close by were several lovely eating places - the boardwalk, the town and across the river. We would visit again. Second stay after 12 years. Rooms are dated, facilities not the best with wrong shower head, skirting falling off & a room without a phone which despite requesting for 5 days never materialised. Also never quite understood why a Nespresso is in the room when they don't supply the coffee for it?! It is also a shame that once where there was a lovely section of tranquil beach is now covered with a club which is not the most enjoyable with a young family & music going in to the early hours, thank God we weren't any closer to it otherwise the holiday would have been a disaster. Plus side is the beach which is very close which and a great day out. Word of warning avoid the Atlantico restaurant when wanting to have some lunch or dinner, the service is appalling & so are the clueless staff Lovely property in great location! Very helpful staff, would definitely stay here again! suitable for 4 star rating, v good location.food and close to good restaurants and for taxi rides to favourites like atlantida restaurant and alvor. staff excellent, no complaints Awesome tweet bedroom apartment with private room and balcony for the price of a single hotel room. Great location. Worth every penny. Attended a wedding, great location and perfect for family's or couples, view if pool or marina, good breakfast, clean rooms/ apartments The rooms were like most 4/5 star hotels but with cooking facilities included which can be great if some days you like to cook your own like my wife because she is a vegan. The marina view from the balcony adds to relaxing view. We had a great stay at the hotel. Location is perfect - close to beach but away from heavy tourist traffic. Breakfast has full variety and view of marina makes for very nice view while dining. Sandy beach is one of best I have seen in Europe. Very customer centric and helpful staff. Big thanks to Thelma and Edgar for making our stay so pleasant . good location with excellent underground parking. Curtains, balcony table and cracked bathroom tiles all need renewed. Very quiet place,excellent for beach,plenty of parking,shops & eating places close,main shops & bars walking distance away. Location spot on. Near beach and restaurants. We booked a 2-bed apartment which was spacious and comfortable. Views of the marina from our balcony. Staff friendly and efficient. Would come back. Enjoyed walking on slipway to lighthouse and the boardwalk. Delightful views We stayed here for two nights - one at either end of a sailing course out of the marina. The location could not be more convenient. The hotel is attractive and comfortable. From the moment we arrived all staff members were very pleasant and welcoming. Hotel is in a great location, lovely spacious rooms that are spotless clean, nice bathroom with toiletries and nice big towels, tv in room with hundreds of channels all in English, breakfast is exceptional with loads of choice and nice cappuccino. Staff very friendly and helpful, would highly recommend Great very short stay. Location is great to access nice pool, beach area, marina etc. Staff couldn't do enough to help and had room perfectly prepared when travelling with a 6m old arriving after 10pm. I had a little grumble about internet cost and staff were quick to address it with a sensible solution (free with a free loyalty programme) and even allowed a slightly later check out to help. Shows they care about giving guests a great experience! ! Fantastic location and wonderful accomodation. The buffet breakfast was to die for! Beautiful rooms, stunning views and right on the marina with direct access to glorious beach, restaurants and beach clubs. Not one thing that we could fault with this hotel. Staff and service were exceptional, nothing was too much effort for them and the buggy service to run you from hotel to beach or marina and back was a godsend during the heatwave. Would go back in an instant. Loved it! Brilliant, staff were so obliging and the young people that drove the buggys were first class It was a very good stay. Loved the hotel and the two pools were great for the adults and the kids. The breakfast was lovely. So much variety in fruits. Loved the apricots and oranges and omelete. Very close to the beach and rooms clean and very helpful reception to book tours and taxis for the days. Great location , rooms need redecorating , bar prices are way to expensive . Some staff could do with being less arrogant and smile more Just returned from a lovely 5 nights at the Tivoli Marina Portimao. The apartments are in a great location close to the fantastic beach and with lovely views over the marina from the balcony .Everywhere is kept really clean.Great choice at breakfast. Pool was freezing but our 6 year old still went in. All staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. One of the ladies in reception was fantastic and helped us with information about a trip to Lagos and arranging Taxis to the airport Overall a lovely quiet hotel - there is not much going on here but that suited us..
Envy Hotel was a very dark hotel, in the hallway and in my room. Some of the lights were even broken. The door was warped and did not close properly. I pushed a chair in front of it to feel safer at night. Also, the peep hole was broken and there was paper shoved into the hole. The shower head leaked everywhere including from the handle. The shower doors did not close properly letting water run outside of the shower. The only heat in the room was a space heater. It was cold at night. There was no comforter on the bed, only two sheets and a thin gritty blanket. The bed itself was very soft and uncomfortable. Above the bed was an exposed and frayed wire. Also, the kitchen was in the basement and smelled moldy. Lastly, I left a day early due to these conditions and the front desk clerk did not seem concerned in the least that I was leaving early due to these conditions. The because was detached from the bed. I hit my hurt my right great toe on the corner of the bed which was injured. I told the receptionist at the front desk and rather thangoing to the room to see my concern first hand or offering to give me another room he referred me to the manager who wasn't available at the time. His customer service reflected his level of training. I respectfully request a total refund due to unsafe conditions of the room and the laxidial attitude. I would also like to speak with manager of the hotel to address my total dissatisfaction with the room and services. Heat did not work in the room on very cold night. I came home with bug bites on my legs and feet. No refrigerator. Otherwise ok. The bug and heat issue sorta negate any good feeling I had by getting a cheap hotel room. Good hotel. Everything okay , small room but comfort. Night staff was rude and not helpful, room was not clean enough, heat was not working, lamp, mirror were broken. Awesome,  the staff was great. The rooms where nice and comfy. Lots of space . I was checked in by a very friendly employee. He told me what was available locally to me,  Very pleasant person. Ended up not even staying overnight here due to first impression. Walked into hotel lobby to a person smoking marijuana openly. The woman receptionist was in the lobby in a verbal fight with another woman yelling curse words. Elevator was not working and when we checked in, we were informed there was no rooms available. Staff unprofessional and overall terrible experience. Wow! The hotel surprised me. I’ve went pass this hotel numerous time and never would have expected it to look that nice in the rooms. The location is not the best, when you go into the lobby it’s ok but the rooms itself was nice. Just passing through on long drive back to South Carolina.It served its purpose with a little charm.Not complaining Piece of Garbage. This facility should be shut down. Good but theire don has a parking... all things thats ok Horrible the room was hot it smelled it was gross my towel has a hole in it. I booked two beds but got one and had to go back and get a new room. Worst hotel ever. It was nice trip at that place, the only thing is missing for any close cleaner shop or laundry Perfectly fine place to spend a couple of nights, central location, walkable to all main downtown attractions including Camden Yards. Nothing fancy and not for fancy people but fine by me. A crash pad for NYE with a surprisingly comfortable bed. Lucky for us, we only had to stay there one night. I don't know who renovated this place, but whoever paid them needs a refund. The faucet in the bathroom was a commercial grade model like you would see in the back of a restaurant kitchen and it was mounted to a piece of spray painted particle board. The shower head was literally held up by a scrap piece of wood and a couple drywall screws. A wonky piece of metal bridged a massive gap between the main room and the bathroom, so when you stepped on it there would be a loud pop as the metal distorted into the void. The thermostat was locked out at a max temp of 66 and there was a plug-in space heater to help offset this. I could go on, but you get the point. They cancelled my reservation without any reason. Than was told there was no availability. Once I called Hotels.com and I had to book a different hotel Envy receptionist said now there was a room available. The room had several things wrong with it.The lamp shade was cracked up n dirty.The handle was broke off the draw.The heater was clicking all night.The cabinet under the sink was dirty.We had to climb out the bed because you could only get out on one side.I thought the room was going to be alot large from the picture on the website. The hotel is good for over night .Bed was clean n comfortable.The overnight stay was ok for a quick getaway. The room was clean, small but just enough to comfotably place your things. Bed was comfy. Service was below average; all but one hotel staff showed interest in engaging with guest. Breakfast didnt have enough variety to make average. Price is was very reasonable. Nice Hotel for the price but needs some fixing up The Hotel Room was very Nice and the Breakfast was good but the Elevator broke down My experience was suitable for my situation,but the was dysfunctional also, the toilet. The staff was not helpful just gave excuses. Asked for Manager that request was ignored. I will never stay here again The pictures are deceiving,  this place is so run down! It's dirty,  the linens weren't clean and it smelled HORRIBLE!! We only went there because our power was out from heavy winds but we didn't stay the night,  that place is horrible. Its a cheap hotel.... U get what u pay for I know what I am paying for this is a low cost hotel but cant advertise wi fi when it is virtually unusable. had to go to hotel computer and even that was near dial up experience. First room I was put into had no carpet and was missing the fridge.So I was upgraded to a much better room. Second room the tv remote was broken so had to constant get out the bed to change channels all night. Tv on played like 5 channels. Staff was really nice. Alot of loud bums outside due to the bus stop right out front. Only issue was that there were a few things in need of repair and no seating in the room except for the bed. Also the heating system couldn't be set above 71 degrees and it was chilly at night. Weird, multi color strobe lighting in the room, with no option for white light. Door had a buzzer that sounded everytime it was open. Our neighbors door went off for hours. There was a vending machine on our floor, that was empty of every option. Couldn't even get a water. Asked at front desk, and they said we could try the one on level 2. Poor atmosphere. Was cheap though, so got what I paid for. I checked into the hotel at about 4pm and was given a room on the 7th floor. I was then told that the elevator was not working so I had to walk up the stairs to get to my room. I am in decent shape so that is not a difficult task but a hotel that has that many floors should have a working elevator at all times. When I arrived on the 7th floor it smelled very bad. I was prepared to go back to the clerk and demand a refund but when I entered the room it did not smell. The bathroom door in the room would not close as it did not have a latch on it. My fiancé and I decided to stay another night in Baltimore because of the long weekend for Presidents' Day. I came across this hotel at a fairly okay price. Well, when we got there to check in, it turned out that they decided to put us in a room with 2 double beds instead of a king room, which is what we had paid for. After talking to the only person at the front desk, I was told that there was nothing he could do and that we would have to wait till the morning to talk to the manager or go some place else. So we stayed. It was our only option at the time. since they offer no parking and we already paid to park our car over night a mile or so away from the hotel. we entered our room, I might as well add that it looked like someone had previously tried to break into this room by cutting away at the outer most wall, which left a huge gash between the wall and the door. When we entered. The two beds were seperate. And because the left wall was pushed out a foot farther than the right wall, we were unable to push our beds together to sleep. There were also stains on the chairs and pillows. Along with blood stains all over the towels. When we looked outside of our window into the dirty nasty alley below, you could see the big rays scurrying down below (that was the highlight of this hotel room). After a long sleepless night, because our neighbors kept getting into screaming matches. We walked our but down to the lobby where we were supposed to talk to our manager. no manager. The hotel was pretty badly run down. My room had wiring hanging from the ceiling, and my co-worker's room had a window AC unit with plywood around the unit that didn't fit properly, exposing gaps to the outdoors. The carpet was torn in places. The air conditioner requires you to insert your key card into a slot on the wall in order for the unit to operate, which means that your room will generally be too warm when returning to it at the end of a day away from the hotel, and make it much more likely that you'll forget to take your key card with you when you leave. I forgot my key card in the slot on the second day of my stay, which meant that I had to obtain a new one from the front desk (on the bright side, the room was still nice and cool when I returned). Arrived at the hotel, found broken glass next to the bed. Tried to leave, found on the lock on the door did not work. Was moved into another room with one king size instead of the two beds we'd reserved. No cover on the light fixture. A/C never cooled down the room to the set temperature so it was an uncomfortable night sleeping. The hotel was nice. We didn't spin much time in the hotel just needed a room to sleep. Everything we did was in walking distance from the hotel. This was the nastiest hotel I've ever stayed at. The staff was rude and didn't care about the people staying there. The A.c. unit was not working, I couldn't get any rest because the room felt like a sauna. Two thumbs down. This was one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. The lobby was dingy and not very clean. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel. It seemed there was no management of this hotel. The room was clean but small. The bathroom door was an old door taken from another room; it had a card slot in it. The staff got our Orbitz reservations wrong. My associate and I stayed 4 nights and had paid 6 months in advance but the hotel staff person didn't have my associate's reservation and it took 1/2 an hour to figure it out. My associate was also supposed to stay an extra night, which we had also reserved through Orbitz but the hotel manager insisted there was no reservation and the hotel was sold out that  night. This forced us to find another hotel to stay for the night. Overall an unpleasant experience. walk into a tiny lobby area where the AC is broken and the person behind the desk is dying of sweat. The only way to get the elevator to work is by hitting down, the up is broken. Open the elevator it's raggedy and looks terrible. AC broken in there as well/. Go up to our floor and we are in the smallest hallway ever. the rooms are literally 2 feet away from each other. Maid service sign left on the door, I guess they were to lazy to put it in the room after they cleaned it. The ac is broken blasting heat as the Thermostat reads 81, and its dialed down to 50. The other ac is a window unit that needs the curtains open to use. So other than trying to make a system work to get the curtains to stay on top of the ac unit, you kiss your privacy away as there is a small open area where you can see 4 other rooms windows and someone literally could walk over to yours and get in. The hotel maintenance didn't want to check the regular ac unit so they came pressed some buttons. I asked to speak to a manager and he said he would tell the front desk, but that never happened. We asked for a different room but they were sold out they said. This was a terrible experience. stay away. We had never been to Baltimore. We arrived at the Envy Hotel. there is not really any place to stop in front of the hotel to drop off luggage etc. we parked at a nearby lot which was $25 per day. The hotel itself was ok.... old but certain things had been updated. Staff was ok...not overly friendly depending on who was working. Room was ok.  the sink and bathroom seemed clean.... the rest of the room could have been cleaner but wasnt terrible. lampshades were old and broken and some lighting in the room was broken. walls had some spots on them but the sink bathroom and bed were clean....  the important stuff. The free breakfast was ok.  just standard stuff nothing great but better than paying for breakfast somewhere else. It was nice that we could walk to everywhere we wanted to go to. The area where the hotel was is definately inner city. This hotel doesn't really look like the pictures posted in their profile. The waiting area in the lobby has ripped furniture. The elevator is old and most of the lights do not work. The decor is old, worn, torn, and kind of seedy looking. The first room:  Black mold along the bottom of the entire shower stall. It's not a tub with showerhead. There isn't a place to put soap or anything so you have to leave the shower door open. The ceiling was taped but hanging down into the doorway with plaster on the floor. The refrigerator was dirty. The bags for the ice bucket were garbage bags. The desk chair was ripped up and dirty. The room was super dark. The second room:  Better? But ripped sheets on the full-size bed (what?). The maid didn't fix the bed properly into the railing so it was sitting on top off one rail and the other side of the rail was completely exposed. I had to pick up the bed move it so it would sit in that rail properly. The room had no heating vents so they supplied a space heater which did absolutely nothing. The windows let in so much cold air that I had to put luggage and coats on that sills to try to block some of it. I had to go to the lobby to ask for more towels. The 5 days 4 nights I was there the staff never came to the room to clean or refresh the towels. I had to stop a maid in the hallway to ask for another roll of toilet tissue. The woman rudely told me to leave when the clock hit 11am. We would recommend this hotel to our cheapskate friends. The lobby is a bit scary, but the room was pleasant. There did not seem to be full maid service. The free breakfast was surprisingly ample and good. good bang for the buck...hot breakfast....just a basic room...well kept...clean.... Room had no heat. Had to get switched to another room This was one of the worst experience I ever had, hotel was cold with no heat on. It was very musty and uncomfortable. Had a weird smell and loud. The elevator hardly worked and shook hard every time u got on. The hotel was nice and clean. The room was HUGE. Definitely staying here when I go back to Baltimore. Untrained staff, not enough toiletries,  room not cleaned everyday, no protection use while cleaning room e.g. gloves; no A/C. Hotel location is good. Breakfast given. Bed and pillows node with red stains. I found the price to be adequate for the accommodations. The bed was comfy and everything was in working order. We also got a free upgrade to a King room. I would have given a higher rating if it weren't for the bathroom door not shutting completely and the large amount of mold in the bathtub. The room was pretty clean with the exception of the shower mold. The front desk staff looked very unkempt and looked like they just walked in off the street. The hotel had a lot of ppl in front some for the bus others just there hanging out. Within walking distance from the aquarium and Lexington Market. With update and renovations hotel would be great. Staff uniforms wouldn't be a bad idea either.
Through Expedia I had booked a triple room that should have had 1 double bed and 2 twin beds - unfortunately when we arrived I found our room had 1 double bed (that could be split into singles) and 1 camp bed. On complaining, the hotel told me that Expedia should not have offered the original option as they had no rooms with 1 double and 2 twin beds and they would bring this to Expedia's attention. Breakfast should have cost 15 euro per person, but as compensation they gave us free breakfasts during our stay. Apart from this incident, the hotel was excellent, great central location, very helpful staff and very comfortable. Fantastic location, friendly staff, clean and comfortable room...even on top floor with odd shaped room into the roof space. But one basic facility missing that spoilt things for us...lack of refreshment. I know many hotels now don't offer tea and coffee facilities in rooms but as the details said facilities were available in public areas we weren't bothered. Then on our second night, having been out in the cold and rain we returned to the hotel looking forward to warming up with a hot drink before bed. Instead we were told that with refurbishment going on this was not available, the only food/drink on offer being at breakfast. What made this worse was that in the morning as well as tea and coffee in the dining room, there was a coffee machine on a table in the reception lounge area. That was then removed when there can't really have been any reason not to let people use it at other times. We had hoped staff might offer to make a drink on request but no, we were told we could go back out to find a bar somewhere where we could get one. This is the first hotel I can think of, which includes smaller lesser rated ones, where no refreshments were available beyond breakfast. Sorry, but refurbishment is no excuse . Very disappointed Situated in Berlin Mitte 250 metres from Hackescher Markt train station and tram stop you are well placed for transport to all points of the compass ,however at night the hotel is easy to miss as the name boards are not illuminated and way above your normal line of sight .The reception staff are courteous and helpful and rooms are clean and comfortable .Being so close to transport links means that you can hear trains and vehicles most of the night but in my case wasn't a problem.Breakfast was fresh and efficient only missing was  bacon for some reason however the wurst was provided also the toaster was playing up just  a 4 slice toaster and two could'nt be used(would'nt stay down) Terrific location, within easy walking distance of Museum Island and with lots of restaurants right around the corner. Pleasant staff and, best of all, an absolutely enormous room sleeping 4, with high ceilings and Windows, a safe and mini fridge. Did not try the breakfast but it looked wonderful and comparable in price to a full breakfast in the neighborhood. Our whole family loved this hotel and if I'm ever in Berlin again I will return. Nice hotel in really good location. Close to Alexanderplatz and lots of sights. Hotel is really nice. Rooms are very clean, spacious and really quiet. Staff is friendly and helpful when needed. Hotel is located in a great area for transportation. Close to subway, train station and even hop on hop off tour bus stop. Walking distance to great food eateries and a supermarket. Good guy on reception, very helpful and explained all the areas to visit. This hotel is located in a prime location with a reasonable room rate. Walking distance to most of the hip places in Mitte and Museum Island. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Hotel staffs were welcoming and helpful. Had a great time. You can walk anywhere (bars, tourist sites, dining, museums, etc...) within 20 minutes. There is a grocery store about 3 minutes away which is good to stock up on water or BYOB. About a 25 euro cab fare from the airport. This is our 2nd time over Xmas at this hotel as the location is so convenient to get to everywhere in central Berlin. Would recommend! Staff is always friendly and helpful and the room is kept clean at all times. Nice breakfast, spacious room, everything felt fresh. Berlin Christmas markets a pleasure! Great location close to 2 train stations and museum island. If its your first trip to Berlin you will love being in the heart of the city Clean and comfortable. The only negative was the wifi was challenging and very spotty. The staff was friendly and accomodating. Perfect location, nice and clean room e great staff Close to everything. Walking distance to train station and many bars.
overall I like this hotel  Have stayed there for the last two years. First complaint, is that the rooms are very hot with no fans to at least move the hot air around. Second. There is no place to purchase a cup of coffee until around 10:00 in the mornings. Coffee can be aquired in the dinning room but it is always full and noisy. I like a little quite time with my coffee in the mornings Overall, we've had a pleasant stay in a hotel. Hotel staff was kind, beach and pool area are nice, room was spacious, a bit old but clean. We've been on all inclusive, and the variety and quality of food was very good. The only thing that was a HUGE dissapointment were the lifts. They simply do not work as expected. And when you have a hotel with hundreds of rooms and probably more than a thousand guests, you need lifts. What makes it even worse is that a friend of mine told me that the lifts were not working two years ago, as well. Therefore, hotel management did absolutely nothing to fix this issue in more than two years! That is a shame. Consider the situation when you're going back to your room on the 8th floor with small children, waiting 10-15 minutes for the lift. Then you manage to go inside a lift with 10 other people. Lift does not move. It simply closes the door and stays on the same floor. There is no ventilation system in the lift, so you (and your children!) are getting out of oxygen. And that situation happens all the time. Imagine loosing 20 minutes for a lift ride, at least 4-5 times a day. Now that is what I call waste of precious time! If you ask me whether I will visit this hotel again, my answer is yes, but only if I get info that they bought new lifts.
30 Minutes drive from the airport, 10 Minutes walk to the black sand beach, Food available from a bakery or mini mart within a 3 minute walk, scooter and quad bike hire directly in front of the hotel. It is a very basic hotel, unfortunately the pool was not up when I stayed but if it was I'm sure I would have enjoyed it a bit more. The beds were hard, the staff kindly moved us and let us choose a bed that was a little softer. Overall this is a good hotel at a great price. This hotel is a good choice for backpackers and budget travellers. I really liked the location, it was close to the beach and away from the touristy areas. However, if you're not planning on renting an ATV or bike, it can take awhile to get around by bus. My room was clean when I arrived but wasn't cleaned while I was there. Also there is no security, it's really easy for anybody to get in. The best thing about this hotel is its low price, great for budget travellers like me. Most important, they pick you up from the airport free, even at 1am in the morning. Thank you Freddy. Also thank you for the free upgrade. I booked a double room, they gave me a quadriple room instead, free! Good people

The food is mind blowing there, room service and facilities quite impressive, I have been there for 2 times in last 2 years. Suggest you all if you looking for a good hotel in Mp go for it and it won't give you pressure in your wallet. Good place near to station and can be spent time with family. Easily accessible and book in advance so that you could end up with good deal. good hospitality . What can be expected more then that in such a small place. Jabalpur can be covered in 1 day trip.
First of all, to anyone on here - DO NOT BOOK THROUGH EXPEDIA. They have add on payments for the following:  Baggage Transfers Breakfast etc. The hotel itself was okay, clean rooms, lovely staff and great location. However, there were a few issues we had. We had a ground floor apartment, which meant we could hear the family upstairs very loudly, especially when they were moving in their beds. It was very loud and continuously woke me up during the night. We are a young couple so it wasn't particularly troublesome, but our main issue was the 'balcony', which wasn't a balcony at all, but about a square metre of space that held a chair and a drying rack. This space was always in the shade, so when there were no sunbeds available round the pool (which was often) we couldn't even sunbathe on the 'balcony'. Apostolis was an absolute gem, all other staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. The location was perfect, restaurants and cafes literally next door and only 15 minutes walk away from the beach. I would ultimately recommend this hotel to friends, but to make sure they purchased a upstairs apartment. We have stayed at the Galaxy Villas before and returned again due to the excellent service that we received last year. We were not disappointed. It was a special birthday for one of our party and we requested the same room as last year. This was provided for us to our delight. The hotel is set in lovely gardens and each apartment is private, There is no one on top of you!!!! There are steps taking you around the complex and to the apartments, so if you have mobility issues then this may not be ideal. The location of the apartments are ideal for us. You step out into the village which has plenty of restaurants, bars, supermarkets and shops. The restaurants are excellent, great food and very friendly locals. A special shout out to Café Greco with Galya, a lovely place to have a cocktail or two before heading back to your hotel or to go into town.The location of the village in the mountains means that you have the best of both worlds. You have the peace and quite of the village and down the hill the busy town of Herssonisos. You can walk to the main town but its not for the feint hearted! the way down is great, coming back is all uphill and a killer!!! Alternatively you can get a taxi which is only 7 Euros! We have been visiting Koultuloufari for a number of years now and have never tired of it. Its well worth a look. We arrived at around 1am and had to call a number to be let in, the staff were lovely - the entire holiday. However, we were surprised by the room as the floor was an outside pavement material and within the hour I had a piece of glass stuck in my foot from the floor. This then happened a few days later to my partner with a much larger piece, luckily we were okay but disappointed we had to always wear shoes inside. The pool is a lot smaller than pictured and unbearably crowded during the day. No rule against reserving sunbeda and as we went out for breakfast at 10am, all of the sunbeda were taken by towels with only three people around the pool. The location was surprising, as its right at the top of a hill (very steep walk back from the beach) we were worried there wouldnt be a lot of restaurants about. But a five minute walk up the hill further, were plenty of bars and restaurants. Also, the drains blocked near the  end of our stay and our room stank. Overall, a lovely location (a bit of a treck to a decent beach) with great, friendly staff. But we were disappointed by the small overcrowded pool and pool area, and the room not being very homely. We loved every moment at Galaxy Villas. Breathtaking Garden and spacious rooms, absolutely super staff and just wonderful atmosphere. We felt welcome! Enjoyed the stay so much that we will definitely book a room at Galaxy Villas as soon as possible again. Thank you, everyone at Galaxy Villas! Staff was amazing. Location was perfect. We can't wait to go back. Great appartments. Excellent location for families. Staff all really nice and helpful. Even the cleaners were great. My bed was a bit harder than I'm used to so I put a blanket under my sheet to make it a bit softer. One of the cleaners must have noticed as when we got back to the appartment there was a 2 thick bed topper on it. Can't recommend this place high enough. The village is beautiful too. It's not at all like the pictures, needs renovation, rooms are old, bed are very hard, pillows are flat. Staff is amazing, pool has a lot of chlorine, not enough chairs for the  pool. Breakfast is 14 euros , you can go out side of the hotel, amazing bakery next door, pancakes 2 euros and 4.50 euros for egg breakfast. Great restaurants too. Just back from a wonderful week. Crete is lovely. The hotel is perfectly located in Koutouloufari with restaurants and shops on the doorstep. Villa was a garden room in the lush garden with a good view. Hotel staff are so friendly and helpful and the manager Dimitris is superb. Would definitely return. Many thanks. We enjoyed our stay. We had one of the larger rooms on the ground floor opening out onto the garden with a sea view. Some of the smaller rooms nearer to the pool area did not look as nice. The pool area was ok but hard to get a sunbed most of the time and busy pool. The staff were lovely and very helpful. The whole place was very clean and well looked after. The staff at this complex are brilliant and are so accommodating and nothing is too much trouble for them , rooms clean and spacious , clean towels every 2nd day and cleaners in every day..and Demetris moved us to a lovely pool view room the morning after we arrived , which was brilliant of him. The resort is lovely and I would definitely return and recommend to anyone thinking of going. From our lovely welcome at arrival to our departure the team running Galaxy Villas were friendly and exceptionally kind. The villas are in a good location and were very clean. The beds were very hard...but I guess that's a matter of personal preference. I would not hesitate in booking again. Thank you Dimitris and team We absolutely loved our stay at Galaxy Villas, the village of Koutoulafari has plenty of amenities in the local area (I strong suggest a visit to Alex & Christines Meze a few minutes walk away and Global Sports next door which is surprisingly great for food and drink), the actual complex and villas were both clean and comfortable although we had a few issues when we first arrived (limescale in the kettle and oven wouldn't work, but both of these were replaced with brand new units the next morning! ), the staff were helpful and incredibly polite. Overall we would return although it would be nice if the wifi worked (we had issues with it multiple times in the reception area just plain not working) or if the rooms had internet access, or at least the TV had more than 3 very basic channels (2 in another language and CNN in english). We paid very little per night (around £10-11) and genuinely cannot grumble at this price, I'd say it was a fantastic stay! Awful. Not as described in pictures and would not recommend at all. They wouldn't even give us a refund even though we were unhappy. Don't ring the number on Google places as that is for their other hotel - this caused much confusion when we couldn't get parking. No room service even though a 4 star hotel. Sprinkler in garden wet us whilst we ate breakfast (which we bought ourselves at the local shop because they had no protein for vegetarians). Grey bathroom was disgusting, you could see it had been spray painted because they couldn't be bothered to clean the grouting! Even pillows on the bed were horrible - not comfortable at all. There was no ventilation, meaning hat you had to leave the door open (yeh lets just get burgled) whilst on holiday....Dirty plates we had to wash before eating. Gardner was even seen wetting one woman's washing with his hose! Need I go on...I'd rather not. Don't bother staying. Ruined our anniversary. Not to mention the lack of privacy outside the room when we ate, as I looked across to see a tattooed chav staring over at us. Pool was also dirty, we ended up going to spa down the road and wished we'd stayed there instead! Not impressed by the hotel or the clientele for what's meant to be four star. Lovely place - staff was very nice and helpful. The staff was very nice and the suite was very nice. I will definately stay here again on my next visit to Crete. I really enjoyed the company of the cats! ! Quite village location, very peaceful and relaxing, good selection restaurants/bars. Apartments excellent very clean with well kept pool/gardens. Staff excellent manager Demitri extreemely helpfull and pleasant why cant all hotel managers be like this. Highly recommend this hotel.
We stayed here one night because it was close to the airport, had van service and big breakfast. Hotel is a very nice convention hotel. We got in late and due to isolated area, we ate dinner at the hotel which was a pretty good buffet selection for our last night in Norway. We were disappointed only because our flight was at 6 am...so no van and no big breakfast. Hotel did provide an early cold continental breakfast and called us a cab. If I had same schedule again, I would check out the Radisson Blu which is actually AT the airport. Great location for short stay. Close to airport. Nearby some shops. Room is ok but twin bed isn't really twin. Breakfast is simply brilliant. Coffee in lobby makes your stay more comfortable. Great hotel, convenient for Trondheim airport, just needs better signposting for reception/entrance, which was not easy to find approaching on foot. The room 3352 cost us $779 for two nights. The room had a narrow window panel overlooking the foyer area so the room was dark and it felt closed in. The rooms on the other side of the corridor had lots of natural light and a better aspect looking to the outside world. The shower grout was very unclean and there was mould on some of the shower tiles. Around the small bar fridge it was dusty and needed a good clean. It was so disappointing to have spent so much money and to be given such a room. At any cost it was unacceptable. When we made the booking online the picture of the room shown was one of the rooms on the other side of the corridor and although I know that you don't necessarily get the same room as shown, this was misleading. We filled out the card with our complaints and left it with reception. We stayed on 15th and 16 August.
I'd give this hotel 3.5-4 stars out of 5. The positive side: Clean, modern, nice service staff, strong wifi connection, pretty good free breakfast, and a wonderful restaurant (MOOD) right downstairs. The food there was really good! The location is okay. About 30 min walk away from Old Town, but there's a bus you can take not too far away. There are a lot of bars and places to eat around the hotel though. And there's a cool grocery store right across the street. The cons: The walls are so thin! I could hear EVERYTHING my neighbors were saying and doing. This made it harder to sleep at night. Also, I kept hearing a water drip from the pipes within the walls or from the AC. Not sure where it was coming from, but really annoying. The only other thing was the neighborhood. I didn't feel as safe walking around in the evening on my own, but it was fine cause I just took Uber instead of walking. Staff made it perfect. Made us special breakfast pack for free as we were leaving too early for hotel breakfast. They gave us a free room upgrade. Restaurant next door makes for great dining and you can have pre dinner drinks on the little deck outside.couldnt recommend it highly enough , Hotel was lovely and clean and modern. Staff were polite and helpful. Only downside was no drink making facility in room. No airconditioner in room. Very small room. Night reception cant talk english. Reception desk staff great, breakfast great, room pretty cool, location pretty good considering bus stop to centre of town only 200m away, we're already planning next trip- thanks
The hotel has plenty of free parking, great w-fi, plenty of friendly staff and is walking distance to Lalandia water park and Legoland. The room I had was quite simple, had a nice big TV and was clean enough but no real luxury when compared to a 4* in the UK. Its very convenient, practical for getting to places and the hotel lobby area is nice if you just want to sit and work, surf the internet or chill. Breakfast is buffet style with plenty of choice but I didn't eat in the restaurant at night so can't comment. Overall, its a bit better than the budget hotels in Denmark so if you can get this one on a deal you won't be too disappointed. Disappointed in room. old and unkept. wall to wall carpet was old and musky. Was away with my 11 year old son. The staff were so helpful and friendly. The room was clean and tidy. This hotel has great breakfast and nice rooms. It's conveniently located near Legoland and it's 3 minutes from the BLL airport. It's truly in the middle of nowhere and the facilities need to be remodeled. I needed a local hotel for a recent business trip, this hotel fitted the bill. a good rate and a nice hotel local to the airport. The rooms were comfortable and the hotel staff friendly and dealt with check in very quickly. The restaurant served good food for a reasonable price. Breakfast was good. The hotel was nice. More expensive than I think it should be even for Denmark price standards. Staff was nice but could have been more friendly. The room was hot and there didn’t seem to be any way to change the temperature other than opening a little window or the door. Breakfast was great. Great location to Legoland and Lalandia Great steaks in the restaurant Friendly staff Very nice room Complimentary WiFi working very well Great hotel which served our purpose. Excellent restaurant too Great location when traveling from Billund. Staff at check in were great and offered to have something for breakfast for me prior to the opening of the normal hours. Restaurant was casual with great food and excellent service but fairly limited menu.
Hotel very accessible. Just 2 minutes walk to the Central station and lots of restaurants are nearby. I left after 2 nights to stay elsewhere. Way to loud and impossible to sleep. Safety a concern. its a small room relatively tidy with shared bathroom & toilets. quite noisy as it is along the sidewalk. I have stayed in this hotel many times my flight was cancelled so I could not get thire so they still took my money of me that's loyal for you Good for the price. Good location. Great staff. Rooms hard to get to due to narrow staircase. Close to the city centre, but be aware, the stairs in the hotel are narrow and winding and there is no elevator. I was only here overnight, so I only needed a cheap hotel. This one is a sister to a more robust hotel next door. The bathroom and shower are in separate rooms, but there are only a few rooms per floor. The room was on the top (3rd floor) so there were some steep stairs, room 9. There is a small window without a view that leads to a narrow roof. You look out to a roof wall in front of you, but it provides air. The bed was comfortable, but the bed spread was stained. The bedding itself was quite clean. There is a TV, a table and hair and a sink in the room. 2 fairly I'll-placed outlets. I would stay again. Also! There is breakfast in the hotel next door which was a plus. Coffee, cereal, bread, cheese, some meat cold cuts. There might have been hard boiled eggs, not sure. It's close to Centraal and on the busy Warmeostraat so good for entrance and exit to the city. You would need to walk to sights, but my night time activity was on Warmeostraat (wink). It was QUIET because it was not on street side. we had. Nice stay.the room was clean and there was a smoking bench outside on the walkway. Room was facing street so lots of noise. The floor of the room was sloped and uneven. Neighbouring hotel room had smoke/weed fumes coming from it all the time. Breakfast was just average. Didn't seem like a great value, but probably it was for the location. You get what you pay for. Fine for a one night stay. Hotel was very poor. Room was not cleaned and the room was in the hardest to get to up 4 flights/ ladders was a very dirty tiny space. I checked out immediately and didnt even stay. I took the 149 euro tab as I was informed that it was 24 hours notice. i will be trying to claim this back ad this was not the service as advertised.
Excellent stay for my partners birthday . Only thing was the lift was out of order when we arrived . Was told it would be fixed after the weekend but we left 48hrs later and still not working. We were on the second floor with a  narrow staircase in places. The breakfast was very good with lots of choice and was included in our package. The hotel is situated up slightly from the main road but the sea front was easily accessible. The room had a sea view comfortable beds and was clean and with attractive modern decor . Very nice with beautiful view of Sidmouth. Unfortunately a lot of construction and remodelling going on. Very comfortable room with a partial sea view. We paid extra to have have a balcony however the room opened out to a shared deck area which was a little disappointing. Rest of the hotel was very nice. Nice hotel modern decor very clean and comfortable room, if a little small. Many nice touches coffee machine complementary gin,sherry and  mineral water. Extememly efficient helpful staff. Fabulous view from dining room and terrace The stsff were very good. The hotel was very clean  The room was small for the price I paid The mini bar was  very pricey Room was well equipped, clean and tidy. Restaurant has fabulous view to sea. Food excellent. Shame you have to pay to use spa facilities. Very pleasant staff, lovely room, within short walking distance of Connaught gardens, beach and town. Bedroom carpet was wet when we arrived,W C seat was  not clean Spider web inn ceiling corner. We visited the hotel expecting it to be lovely. It lived up to our expectations and more. Would definitely stay again Absolutely stunning hotel, great views and lovely facilities. Extremely friendly staff who gave great service. Would come back anytime! Good accommodation, food and location. Able to take my dog. Extremely helpful staff, excellent facilities. Would certainly go back again. Very good value Smooth check-in and taken to our room by John who showed us around. Lovely room, with a decent sized bathroom. Fantastic view of the bay of Sidmouth. The hotel is a short walk, along the prom, to the town centre where there are plenty of shops. A fair number of which are independents, such a lovely change from the huge chains taking over our High Streets. Breakfast was plentiful, and fresh. I was able to choose combinations of what I liked from the menu and the kipper was delicious. All the staff we came across were helpful and friendly. The hotel was beautiful, and had a nice spa and dining facilities. The service was generally just ok - the service at the restaurant was slow and we had a send a few dishes back. The rooms were very nice as well, but for some reason very warm. The front desk was very helpful however, and booked us taxis a number of times at short notice. Beautiful setting in Sidmouth. The complimentary Sherry and Gin is a nice touch. The hotel still has a lot of ongoing building work as it is being renovated. Food service was quick. We would definitely stay there again! Spacious bedroom and bathroom with large comfortable bed. Staff are welcoming and efficient. Good food in the restaurant at both breakfast and dinner. Pleasant views from hotel and close to lovely gardens and promenade. Lovely hotel, great friendly staff, right by the coast and a sea view for breakfast! One night comfortable stay although weather was poor Very smart and comfortable hotel. Lovely room, breakfast and facilities. Great position. Will definitely go back. Excellent stay and highly recommend.
We stayed in July 2017 and had da great time in Paris. I had an awesome view of the sunrise from my window one morning. The hotel is just across the street from a metro so it was very convenient. We also walked several times to the Eiffel Tower (just 20mins). The rooms are a bit tight (almost all Paris hotels are) but it was no big deal. It was clean and comfortable. Air con worked fine, bathrooms and mini-bar always stocked and the staff were always friendly. Yllen Eiffel is our favorite Paris hotel. It's across the street from Metro line 12, in a nice residential area, and very consistent quality with long-term, friendly staff. We recommend it to all of our friends. Very little staff. We went out to dinner and we're locked out of hotel when we returned. Front desk staff was not there we rang the bell and waited and waited. We ended up having to go to the side door and find a way in Wonderful hotel,  courteous staff,  great location,  subway station across the street. Great cafe/restaurants within walking distance. Loved it and will stay again. Family room is simply the best for folks traveling with kids. Perfect for short breaks exploring the city, metro & café right on your door step. would defiantly stay here again, great price for the location. Comfortable, clean，great breakfast. Had a pleasant stay in the hotel. Close to public transportations. The staff are great , my room was a little small but I would stay there again This hotel ideally located across frim the Metro has access to many cafes and conveniences. The room although small suited our needs and i would highly recommend. Service can make or break the difference. I needed early morning transportation to get to CDG, and the night manager presents me with several options, very clear English, and made it happen. All with a little breakfast to go. Very hospitable - much appreciated at the beginning of a long travel day,  thank you thank you Great price, friendly staff,  very clean, subway entrance literally across street. Typical big city rooms, small. Good shower, good lift. Quiet at night.
Staying at this hotel felt like visiting friends in Italy. Staff was beyond welcoming and accommodating (and spoke perfect English). In the mornings, we had simple yet nutritious breakfast, coffee made to order and were asked about our adventures the day before. Staff was eager to make recommendations for places to explore and the best restaurants in town! The hotel has a cozy roof garden where we occasionally rested in the middle of the day or enjoyed a panini or a slice of pizza with a view of Colosseum. The location was in the heart of Rome. We chose to walk everywhere, including from/to the train station (about 15-20 minutes), but the metro station is around the corner, especially if you want to take it to the Vatican. The room itself was simple but clean and had a decent Wi-Fi connection. We had an option to leave our bags at the reception before our room was ready and after checkout so that we were free to make the best of our trip. We will definitely be coming back here! Pros- Great location (a couple min walk to Colloseum), hotel staff was kind (helped arrange shuttle and let us check in early after a long flight.) Cons-  Very small, bed was really hard, shower was tiny, room could have been cleaner, had ac but didn't work really well. Loved Rome, the history and the architecture. Unfortunately this hotel was probably around when most of ancient Rome was built. It would probably be ideal for students, not too fussy and on a low budget. Hotel is small, something like 18 rooms. Rooms are small but adequate. Hotel is located on a quiet street close to the Colosseom  Staff were friendly and helpful. Definitely would stay there again. The room was not as clean as I would have expected, there were some issues with the air conditioning unit as it was warm in the room, the showers are extremely small but I assume that is part of the culture. Nice Hotel to stay for vacation. We enjoyed stay there and hotel is clean. This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this lovely boutique hotel, and we love it. Located just 5 minutes walk to the Coloseum, very nice, clean and quiet, and the staff is lovely. There is a very nice roof terrasse with a lovely view of Rome and the Coloseum. The breakfast, which is included, is also very very good. Would recommend highly. Great location near to all the best sites, staff very friendly and helpful but rooms are very small. Breakfast was good though Hotel was everything we needed it to be. Very comfortable. Breakfast excellent. Great value for money. Above all it is 5 mins walk to the Collosseum and closer to the Forum. Bathroom very clean and great shower, but may not suit someone of above average size. A wonderful place to stay, just a short walk to the Colosseum, Trajan's Market along with lots of other sightseeing hotspots. Plenty of restaurants close by to choose from. The breakfast is great. excellent location close to forum, staff very friendly and accommodating. rooms are comfortable and clean. a good choice for a short break to see the main sights of Rome Near to metro station  Hotel room small Not hot drink water Breakfast ok Near to poi The location is excellent, just a few minutes' walk from the Colosseum. The staff were very friendly and pleasant. The room and bathroom were clean, though small. The breakfast had a lot of nice choices including scrambled eggs, waffles, cereal, ham and cheese and rolls and croissants. Our air conditioner worked great even though it was 98 degrees Fahrenheit outside. There was shower gel and shampoo and soap and a hair dryer (but no washrags). There was a mini fridge. Extra pillows were available and there was an in-room safe. There was a lovely rooftop patio with a view of part of the Colisseum. I would be happy to recommend this property to my friends. Perfect for a city break! Me and my partner just returned from a 3 night city break. We wanted somewhere really central, and this was just that! A 2 minute walk to the colosseum and a metro station. The staff were very friendly, and the breakfast was awesome - ensure you try the cappuccinos. There was a city tax that we had To pay which was a surprise to us, although I believe this was not the hotels fault and the Hotels.com app instead for not making that clear. The Fori Imperiali is ideally located just 2 mins walk from the Colosseum in a quiet, cobblestone street surrounded by restaurants. It is a small hotel (circa 20 rooms) and the hotel staff provide a personalized service to cater for your needs. The hotel is, well Quirky is the word that springs to mind, but in a good way. It certainly grows on you day by day. Each room has it's own charm (I saw 5 while I was there) and I would recommend room 206 with it's private terrace complete with whicker chairs, gazebo and table. The rooms are on the small side, but adequate, and this for me just adds to the charm. My wife and I stayed 5 days. The breakfast room was charming and the food was fabulous. My wife is gluten intolerant and was served gluten free bread and cookies every morning. The room was quiet and very clean. Bed was just right. The staff was fantastic. Rosa  was very helpful for information for getting around Rome and what to see. Paul checked on visitation hours at a church we wanted to visit on our last night and called us a cab to get us to the church before evening mass. Restaurant recommendations were spot on. The owner of the hotel has a vineyard and has red and white wine available for purchase. Once you have the wine there is an nice terrace on the roof of the hotel to sit and relax with a view of the Roman Colosseum. What a great hotel, we will be back on our next trip to Rome. Great place to stay if you want to experience Roman Rome. Great hotel! Excellent location! Down the street from the colosseum and so many restaurants and shops! Very good experience. Perfect location for the hotel,  nice breakfast, small but comfortable rooms It was a very clean , friendly staff but older hotel and in sort of in an alleyway might not appeal to some.was a couple of blocks to the coliseum and a few short blocks to restaurants I loved our stay here, the staff went above and beyond to make our stay the best. I loved talking to Rosa who recommended a wonderful restaurant for dinner. It's close to Roma Termini and very convenient for walking around the old city. Great breakfast, too! Nice hotel in an excellent location. We stayed there 6 years ago and had a brilliant size room with a double bed. This time the room was booked as a double, but we had two single beds in a VERY cramped room. We would stay again but would definitely request confirmation of the room type and size. I'm glad we didn't take the Cat with us......... Absolutely no complains. Great location: a couple of blocks from Colosseum, Palatine and both forums; a block from a main road. Metro stop is right there; 15-20 min walk to Roma Termini. Employees were very nice and helpful. Breakfast was good and varied. Typical bacon and scramby eggs, a variety of pastries, and yogurts/cereal, oj. Not a 5 stars hotel, but a 5 stars stay for me. Rome wa This hotel is in some dire need of updating. There was an issue with hot water (we didn't have much) but the service was really, really nice as was the breakfast. Beds were NOT comfortable-the higher rating was due to the good service. Good - location, staff was nice  Bad - wifi in our room was bad/nonexistent, bed was advertised as a queen but was actually two beds put together so there was a crack in the middle, bed was hard as a rock, paper thin walls, the breakfast made both of our stomachs hurt. Overall, great location downtown, a couple blocks to the metro/Colleseum, and close to restaurants, but wouldn't stay here again. First, the location could not have been better, for my purposes, which was to run the Rome Marathon. It's only about two blocks from both the Start/Finish on Via del Fori Imperiali and about a block from the Colosseum Metro stop. I had room 403 (top floor) which has a balcony with seating overlooking the street. If I were to stay there again I would probably request a room facing the courtyard because there can be some noise from the street and the restaurant kind of across the street but down a little on the same block (which I ate at twice and thoroughly enjoyed). The hotel has a fantastic buffet breakfast and they were even very kind enough to start it early on marathon morning. All of the staff I interacted with spoke English and were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was about the size of a typical American bedroom but was very adequate. Besides, you don't travel to Rome to spend time in a hotel room! The rooms have safes and mini-fridges. Oh, there is a garden roof top area for seating too. Plus, a huge plus for me, it's 100% non-smoking! ! First, the location could not have been better, for my purposes, which was to run the Rome Marathon.

I stayed here for a week on vacation and can't say enough about the staff--they went out of their way to make me feel welcome and were more than accommodating to some last minute booking requests (my sister joined me at the last minute). I'd definitely stay here again, it's in a great location--easily walkable to all sites. The hotel staff were very friendly & helpful. The room was comfortable with its own air conditioner. Our room was quiet from traffic noises but we could hear reception talking & when other people returned to their rooms at night clearly (we were in Room 103). The shower size was so small that when you turned around you would knock the taps & shut the water off (we're not big people). The water pressure & heat were fantastic. The location of the hotel is brilliant! A stroll to the Colosseum & ruins, near bus stops, restaurants & an 8 minute walk to a laundromat. Overall we loved this hotel & would definitely stay there again. The hotel is in a quiet side street within an easy stroll of the colosseum and the Forum. Staff very friendly and obliging. Our room had a private deck but the common roof garden perfect for relaxing. There are many restaurants close by. Highly recommend it. Charming little hotel a stones throw from the Colosseum. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean. The decor was a little dated... but we were very happy with our short stay. The buffet breakfast was really good too! A small hotel that tries their best to accommodate guests. My room had a balcony and there is also an upstairs area with a view. You get what you pay for with this hotel and my stay was comfortable. The breakfast was really nice. Make a turn and go through an arch and a few short steps later you are standing in front of the Collesum. Great starting place to tour Rome on foot.
The hotel facilities were good. There was a local market within walking distance and the hotel shuttle boat made it easy to get to the train station. The reception staff we dealt with were not very friendly or welcoming. I had booked a deluxe king room and on checkin was asked to pay for the second person occupying the room which was ridiculous. They waived the extra charge once we complained that no other hotel would charge extra fees for the second person in a king room! Overall, hotel is good but reception staff need a change of attitude. Really good location on the river to get about on the boat taxis. The breakfasts were amazing and we really enjoyed drinks on the rooftop with such an amazing view at night. Did feel the room was a bit tired but very much enjoyed our stay and very good value for money. It was fine only problem would not except visa debit card as deposit do not have a credit card.very good location and food was excellent As usual, Hilton is one of the most convenient hotels wherever you go Very attractive hotel, clean with a pleasant, helpful staff. The room was small and missing a few amenities but when we called they gave us what we needed. The prices at the hotel (food, drink) were too high but the quality and presentation excellent. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others. Very nice hotel as it supposed to be with  Hilton brand. They have to sell breakfast  packages,otherwise it is getting to expensive to pay for breakfast $27 per person when you are not hungry but tour pick up very early and you can't get your cup of coffee but pay for complete breakfast. Location is good ,river shuttle big help . Sky train very close which is great plus Awesome and nothing else. By the river, with boat shuttle Beautiful hotel nice view of the river. Have a great hotel buffet Lovely hotel right by the river. The hotel offers a really convenient shuttle boat service to the main pier (10mins journey) every 20 minutes. There's a cute little market and great Thai restaurant called 'Be my guest' just next door as well. The staff are welcoming and helpful and the rooms were nice too. Everything was excellent except for the shower the water was cold Great hotel, quite stylish. Booked a suite so had 2 rooms, private check in, club floor, free happy hour free breakfast and a great view for sundowners from the 31st floor. Location is very handy for all the water transport options. Most staff was good except one at concierge. He was most unhelpful due to his arrogance and ignorance. We love the location and view I am a horrible experience at this Hilton hotel. I am Chinese American, the staff treated me differently than cacasions. The hotel room bathroom countertop had stains when I arrived to the room. hotel is very old , corridors and rooms are smelly , air con are super noisy , no hot water in the toilets , Overall a good experience. Room furniture and upholstery needed update and cleaning otherwise it was a good experience and friendly staff Thought the standard of food was average but was v v expensive. My experience was a Okay one , I booked a river cruise through the hotel and it wasn't good . We had to change to a different boat because the one we were booked on was double booked by people that just bought there tickets at the entrance. That whole experience was very disappointing and everyone was complaining on the night . For an infamous brand name the condition and cleanliness of some of the facilities was a let down. Excellent stay after second time of booking at the Millennium Hilton. Easy reach of all shopping and eating complex's by catching shuttle boat from the hotel jetty. Staff see to every need and are very helpful at the desk for any questions you may have. The Hotel has an excellent dining area and the food is superb, we especially enjoyed the variety at breakfast Loved it great location well priced food. Room was nice big bathroom. Great hotel on the river. Facilities & restaurants very good. Great view from the 360 bar My husband and I stayed here for one night, to mark the end of our Honeymoon in Thailand before we went home. It was nice to go to the 360 bar on our last night. Nice and easy-going, which was what we needed. What a great view! This was actually why I picked this hotel. The drinks/food were expensive, but the view was worth it (and we only stayed 1 night). The view in our room was AMazing. It was of the river. The breakfast buffet was good, but pricey. I was also surprised there wasn't more Thai food (although a big Chinese selection). I noticed there wasn't a lot of Thai food at the 360 bar, too (unless we were there too late at night). So, my only complaint was the food (expensive and not much Thai food). Otherwise, we really enjoyed the ambiance. This was our 1st time in Thailand so I felt safer going with a Hilton. We reserved 2 rooms and they were clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful and spoke excellent english. The location was perfect. Next to the hotel is right next to Klongsan Plaza. The 4th floor pool was an awesome place to hang out and drink. We just didn't spend enough time there to fully explore the hotel. I'd love to go back. Excellent staff; excellent breakfast buffet; great location for river taxi. Great hotel just on the other side of river. Perfect view of the skyline. From the minute we walked in we fell in love with the hotel. There is a market within 20 seconds of front entrance. Highly recommended. No willingness to care of customers. If I were, would give several useful information on festival which would be held near the hotel beforehand. Executive lounge access was worth it! Amazing free breakfast and happy hour daily. Room was great. Great view. I read reviews that because it was ok the wrong side of the river, the location wasn't the best. I disagree. Hotel offers a shuttle across. And you can't beat the river views and a hotel with its own doc to get dropped off at by boat. Pool area was nice. Really have nothing bad to say. We were sad to leave! The location and facilities are very good to stay. Just crossing the ferry to go downtown and chinatown. Very clean ro and comfy. Suggest for foreigner to stay for the best riger view. This was the perfect hotel to stay at in Bangkok. We stayed in the executive suite and it was recently refurbished. The suite was large, modern and had amazing views. Even more amazing than the views was the staff. The hotel location was perfect as it was a 2 min ferry ride from being next to everything. Would recommend to anyone! Restaurants good. Room service ok. But hotel smells bad All good  Nice hotel Nice views Free boat ride to sky train Hotel is located in a great area and a short boat ride across the river takes you to the Mass transit railway system that is great. All rhe staff are very friendly and hopefully.
Colorful rooms, big bathroom and in a perfect location. If your reservation includes breakfast, make sure you remind them. On arrival Kavinda the help desk speaks English and approachable the rest grumpy not speaking English not smiling at all and the restaurant staff Italian was rude to us! Plug outlet quite loose vey dim curtains not like in the pictures I saw when I booked it. Hall way so dirty! Room was in terrible condition? We stayed for 2 nights they didn’t cleaned the room when asked they said they will check but no reply, no hot breakfast, holes on the curtains, heating was less, can’t lock room or bathroom properly  Won’t recomm anyone, worst experience If you can make it through the lobby that smells of warm faeces and across the roof to your broom closet room them you might want to invest in some ear plugs. Staff are boring, breakfast is horrid, bathroom... dont get me started. I hope you dont like natural lighting. Can't beat the location of this hotel in Venice. But hotel is older and slightly outdated. No elevator which was frustrated. Corridor smelt a bit. But was a cheap alternative and comfortable enough for a short stay. Good hotel staff, cleaning everyday, just a basic room, bed and small toilet, but you pay what you get, price is ok as Venice is expencive. Decent hotel for Venice. Venetian hotels are a bit smaller than American hotels. Venice hosts a lot of tourists so there is a fair amount of wear and tear. If you know what to expect the size and patina is pretty standard. Bed looked like a U. It was the most uncomfortable bed - and my husband is back pain free (or was). They pumped heat in. No ac on until May but that’s not what Expedia stated. Bathroom was ok. Overall very very small and supposedly we got a Superior room since we were on our honeymoon. After asking for Hangers, we were given 6! No IRON! Ugh The location of this hotel was perfect! Easy walk to major sights. Room was small but adequate and the breakfast was good. Paid for a triple 1 year in advance but was given a double on check in. Bathroom had hole in wall with the grout very gross like not being clean. Bed was the worst for comfort. Carpets were stained... more to be said but there are good points. Very central and great location. Decor in room was very nice. Enjoyed the authentic feel. First, the location is wonderful for the price. There were mixed reviews, however I really don't think that it matters that there are stains on the carpet leading to the room because I thought the room was very unique And very close to main attractions. The absolute best thing that I can say about this hotel is that I accidently left my tablet in the room and when I realized that I had left it, I contacted the hotel and they verified that they had it and stated that they would send it back to me. I gave them my address and thanked them. It really doesn't matter that it took over 2 months to get here because shipping from Europe to US is quite slow. However, it is very important to point out that this hotel acknowledged that they had my tablet, after I had contacted them, and they stated they would mail it back to me and they did! They never even asked for any reimbursement for mailing it to me. My experience was wonderful and after having my tablet returned to me it was above and beyond anything I would ever expect. Thank you very much for the exceptional service!! ! Bed was uncomfortable but room was nicely decorated. Breakfast was average. Clean room but the building cold use upgrades (cracks in the walls and floors). But overall good hotel with a great location.
Good hotel, reasonable price. Near train station. Good breakfast buffet. Be aware of an 18 Euro charge for parking, which is across the street. Sort of ok. Not too impressed with cleanliness. Food was good. Close to all facilities and clubs and pubs.
Nice Hotel with great lake view and plenty to do around, if you love outdoor activities. Rooms are fine. Breakfast could be better! ! We stayed for a weekend in a room with lake view. The hotel staff is nice and professional. Great location for recreation and sport for adults and children, also convenient to explore the city. Nice hotel and decent food in restaurant. Outside of city but was convienient for my needs. The stay was good, spacious and clean room, but a couple of issues to nitpick.... the unimportant one really was the TV was 4:3 flatscreen (I had no idea you could even get those) with over the air antenna quality picture. The one that really bothered me was the shower. The tub was a teardrop shape with the shower at the narrow end and a curtain that was mounted to hang, with room to spare, inside the tub. You have to stand sideways to the water flow or else it will stick to you. Pleasant stay & attractive location overlooking Malta Lake. Public areas modern & clean. Bedrooms rather dated with poor quality tv. Breakfasts good with wonderful views overlooking the lake.
Excellent location near the shopping Mall. Massive pool with lifeguard supervision. Room service was excellent, the only thing negative about the room was the carpet around the edges and under furniture needed a good vacuum cleaning. Plenty of restaurants in the hotel, a cheap breakfast opposite the hotel called Denneys. The Outback Steakhouse also opposite the hotel serves the best steak I have ever eaten. You must try the oyster sauce with it. The Beatles Love cirque du solely was magnificent, worth all the money. Robert We have been to las vegas before and once again had a fabulous time. This time we stayed at the Mirage Hotel. We enjoyed a comfortable pleasant stay, quite central, clean and had everything you need. We would stay there again. A great hotel right in the heart of the strip. Free parking for those with a vehicle, just drive into multi storey. Clean rooms with good beds. The hotel is in a great location centre strip within easy walking distance of The Fashion Show Mall, Linq Promenade & Forum Shops @ Caesars Palace. The buffet although a little pricey is excellent, at the weekend unlimited champagne in addition to beer & wine. The trip was very good with excellent flights with United & Air Canada . The Hotel & it's staff were brilliant but they cannot not do any thing about the weather or the strong Dollar. Las Vegas is still a great place to go to if you want to go shopping,Dining out or going to shows. Stayed in a standard room with 2 queen beds and 2 children. Good size, clean with air con and all essentials. Couldn't use fridge as stacked with bar drinks, but ice and bucket available. Plenty of places to eat at hotel or across the road. Lovely pool but get down at 9am for best sun beds! Hotel was elegant and well maintained. Room was clean and the view was great. However, their Buffet--Cravings was horrible. We went there because of the ratings both in the Las Vegas Review and the Travel Channel review of the best Buffets in Vegas. The cost was compatible to most of the other hotel buffets so since we were staying there we gave it a try. I should have realized that something was amiss when there was NO line to get in and the place was more then half empty. Never seen that before. We were escorted to our table and proceeded to try the various stations. Can't remember but there must have been 8 stations looking at what was offered at each it was difficult to determine what each was because more then half the items WERE NOT LABELED!! at each station. Now lets get to the food-- Most of, if not all had no flavor and dry to a point that the meat could not be cut with a knife (bourbon chicken) I'm not sure what mine was because there was no label that too was uncutable as were other items. The sushi area  had some wonderful looking pieces however the one I got was one bite and out it came. the desserts I only found one appetizing one the fruit  The experience was not one I would tell my friends about. The Only redeeming piece was when I discussed this with the manager, he was very understanding and sympathetic considering that it was not one item BUT the entire menu and provided me with a refund. Again the manager did the right thing But the food was Horrible. We enjoyed our 3 night stay. Lots of choices for food right in the hotel. We especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Cravings! Was delicious. Spent a nice relaxing day near the pool. Was not able to sit too close to the pool as it was crowded, found a nice shady tropical spot in the back. It was lovely. I also enjoyed some time visiting Siegfried and Roys lions, tigers and dolphins in their habitat near the pool. Would like to see the show love next time we come and stay! We were glad that our room seemed very quiet. Las Vegas is party town and we expected some noise... but no. We heard very little noise in the hallways through the later nighttime / early morning hours. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. (That is, when we had time to sleep.) Furniture in rm. is dated. Carpet frayed at seam Side Chairs were soiled and stained Had a great time in Vegas the Mirage is excellent well situated on strip all round the Hotel is excellent Had a great weekend, great service, they respected my no smoking room The absolute best. great location on the strip. great restaurants within the resort, amazing pool, friendly staff, easy check in check out. Another extremely large and noisy casino hotel. Not bad except it took 2 days to come and fix the toilet, and the maintenance guy woke us up at 12am! A little disappointed in the additional hotel expenses upon check out. This price should be I included in the total check out when booking through 3rd party company’s. I had 4 rooms for 3 nights.... an additional $400+ for resort fees at check out left a bitter taste in my mouth after having an amazing weekend. Other than that, great resort! Checking in received a free upgrade the room over looked the strip and the volcano. The only thing that could be better is the drink service I could have used some water from time to time. I really never seen anyone taking drink order while I was playing. Older resort located on the strip, a little North  We only ate at LVB Burger within the hotel and food was terrible! Maybe it was our timing (3 pm) but my grilled chicken breast was cold (reheat from lunch time?! ), the bun seemed old....overall no one in our party had a good experience. Bed was comfy, staff did a great job of cleaning and restocking towels everyday. Only complaint is the shower tap was fairly loose and difficult to get a consistent shower temperature. Only issue was the first night. We were given a disabled room with a hoist in the corner of the room. We felt it was a health & safety hazzard. Also the front desk said there were no other rooms available that night. Hard to believe in a hotel that size. We were more than happy with the remainder of our stay. Exceptional hotel in a great location. Check in was brutal. Not pleasant to deal with. The Mirage is right where you want to be! It’s in a great location. Our room was comfortable and clean and we never heard a sound from other rooms! Nice hotel but showing signs of age. Check in took a while but on the whole satisfied with the hotel. Tended to spend most of our time in the Venetian casino across the road. Great stay , great pool . Will stay there again. Loved the small zoo with dolphins and large cats. Amazing hotel. Comfortable and all the amenities that you could wish for. It is situated in a brilliant place on the strip. Customer service is excellent. The Mirage was great. The concierge was helpful. The desk allowed us to check out a little later due to our departure time. Very much appreciated. Fantastic hotel! Prime location excellent location on the center of the strip. Nice restaurants in the hotel. Beautiful pool. Everyone was so nice and friendly. The food and cocktails were great and well priced. The tables range from $10/hand up which is nice. Parking was inexpensive as well. I have stayed in this hotel 5 times over the last 10 years and I am never disappointed. If you want to be on the strip in Vegas, this is a great central location and has reasonable restaurant choices. If cleanliness is high on your priority list, I would not recommend this hotel though. We had two rooms for our group. The rooms were  a good size, but ours had way too much visible dog hair in the carpet, which stayed there for all four days of our stay. Definitely a problem if you have allergies. Our friends had a shower that had people hair in it and they said they could tell the bathroom had not been cleaned. They complained at the front desk. Some fresh towels were brought, but the bathroom was not actually cleaned. They took a day of the resort fee off, but never actually addressed the problem during the four day stay. Both our rooms had a view of the roof, which also had a lot of garbage on it. We totally enjoyed our stay. Only issues we had were cost of sodas in gift shop and water. I do not like spending 5$ for sodas I had to go to Walgreens to get 2 for 4$. Restaurant prices OK but I think what we enjoy in our room should be less costly. Mirage has steep pricing already without gouging in daily needs. Also, first night We were there, we woke up to stink that we thought was skunk. Our Grandson advised us that was marijuana. If smoking illegal in rooms, this should also be respected. Every night after, the smell in early morning hours was skunky. Had to cover my face to sleep. That would be something We believe should be addressed. After numerous attempts to advise the staff and mammage that some one was smoking on the floor nothing could or would be done. They did offer to send up a machine to clean the air but we would have to vacate the room several hours, which we did, only to have the smoker/s return. Due to my allergies to smoke that made it a very tuff time and uncomfortable stay. If I wanted smoke in the room I would order a smoking room. We had a television in the bed room which worked half the time. But the cleaning staff wow what a great group of people. Really enjoyed the stay, awesome hotel n location. Staff is outstanding. The room fridge, cannot use for leftovers, you bump a can you get charged. Don't move the condiments to view, get charged. Toilets really low, and if cold like it was for us, heat not much. Little things but mostly really enjoyed stay. Machines are really tight so not much fun. Knew was going to lose but not that quick. Jumped around machine to machine cause not doing anything. Right off the bat when we checked in we were told of a RESORT FEE of $209.75 US dollars. We were NOT expecting this or was it indicated on the travelocity itinerary. Also a on the Travelocity website it said Free Breakfast for 2 per stay. We were under the impression that it was everyday but instead we only got one breakfast included. The hotel showers had mould on the walls. We thought it should have been cleaner for a hotel of this grade. Very comfortable casino experience. Enough open tables always. Very player friendly. Reward play is questionable. Hotel has good restaurant selection. Enough coffee options in the mourning, no lines. A great stay at the Mirage. Great staff, accommodations, etc. The Sports Book is superb! The Buffet and Deli are great! Highly recommend both. Minor Issues:  the parking key pass - room key - doesn't work very well. The Chinese Restaurant is mediocre at best. Disappointed. Check in was bad. We request a king size bed and ended up with 2queens. We were to have a strip view and ended up with a view of a pool that was getting remodeled. Not very willing to get you the room you paid for Enjoyed our time, our friend booked separate from us and the front desk helped so that we could be close together! Room with a view was nice, it overlooked to pool, so that means we had a view of the strip facing Caesars. Hall was pretty quiet, only heard a couple people in the hall did hear neighbors a little on our last night but nothing the other two. Great location on the Strip, selection of restaurants, friendly staff, comfortable & spacious rooms Friendly staff. The buffet was very good and the rooms were clean and comfortable clean hotel, great food, centrally located on the strip. The hotel was outdated and overpriced. They wanted to charge me $4.00 for a tiny bottle of water. I wouldn’t recommend the Mirage to anyone. There are so many better place in Las Vegas to stay. Stained sheets on my bed and bathroom light went out. Great Location! Awesome price! Third time staying at the Mirage and it never let’s me down! One of my Favorite hotels to stay at in Vegas! Will definetly come back to visit. Check in time said not till 3pm but the Receptionist hooked me up and got me a room at 11:30 AM. Friendly staff and nice casino. Has a little bit of everything. Their prices are horrible for food, drinks, ect.. They had to upgrade our room, because the first was a terrible mess. Their security staff were rude at times. The sushi restaurant was horrible and way too expensive. When we went to other hotels, they had deals, more restaurants, pleasing staff and more things to do. We really enjoyed staying at the Mirage. However, there is one think I with they had. Security person by the elevator to check the room key as they do at TI and Trump Hotel. If I am by myself, its a comfort to know there is someone there. All others were great! ! I was very happy with my experience with the Mirage. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas. I stayed at Treasure Island my last trip, which is a fine hotel, but I enjoyed the Mirage more. There seemed to be more entertainment options (although it's been quite a few years since I stayed at T.I.). I loved the tropical feel with the trees and such in the lobby. The staff was very nice in the interactions I had with them. We were told pool wd b open and heated but when we arrived it was actually closed and smaller one was open but not heated . Given wrong room and hotel staff was rude and mocked me when I asked for manager. Way overpriced food and drinks. $44 for three cups of frozen yogurt! Fun experience. Lots to do. Will have to come back. Clean and comfortable room but a long walk. Front desk not v helpful and keen to up sell rather than listen to requirement eg room to view sunset, gave us wrong side of building Great hotel, fantastic location and attentative staff! Good location, barely 4 star quality, but pretty good. We had an amazing time at the Mirage. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel rooms are very modern, large sized and clean. We loved the Casino here and the bars and restaurants were all great. Would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends and family. Stayed at the Mirage for the second time and once again it didn't disappoint, hotel/rooms is clean, rooms are spacious and a wonderful view. Plenty of things to do you need 8 days minimun visit all the casinos and dont over dress its very hot Hotel was ok bed was comfortable. Was horrified when i checked out and had a phone charge for $27. When i asked she said oh the operator should have mentioned the cost and there should have been a pamphlet there explaining it. Well guess what there wasnt an operator or a pamphlet otherwise i would not have made a 1 minute phone call for $ 27!!! ! Easy to get a cab anywhere from the Mirage and there's a bus stop out the front to travel up and down the strip. There's a small shop you can buy personal needs from, plenty of bars and restaurants. Very clean and spacious rooms. The pool is overcrowded and you have to pay if you want to see the dolphins. Great hotel but with the amount of people your just a number to staff and they still expect and also ask for tips which is not very professional tips should be earned not expected . The over powering cigarette smoke is also an issue on the casino floor , on the 3rd day was the breaking point and was time to leave .. But that's Vegas .. As soon as you walk in to this resort it has a disgusting smell. We ended up checking in to Aria instead after a couple of days which was a  much nicer resort Good hotel and casino. Good restaurants and bars. Easy checkout. Mirage was a great choice for our escape from winter to see Elton next door at Caesar's Colosseum. Excellent staff from bell hops to front desk. Surprisingly top notch late dinner in Stack with 70s rock music in the background, delicious scallops with Jimi, Eric, Allmans, etc. Good name that tune battle of music from our past with my wife. Waiter was spot on. Spent a good bit of fun time in the Casino, but really enjoyed the convenient location to walk/explore Caesars, Bellagio, Venetian, etc. Very disappointed in the customer service . At checkout there were erroneous charges on my account. When I questioned them I was accused of lying by the manager, Diana. She was very accusatory and kept saying that there NEVER were billing errors and that they would do an investigation and pull up camera images to prove they were correct. After confirming with the spa that they charges were in fact incorrect I returned to tell Diana who didn't even as much as apologize for her accusations or the errors. I have never been so treated so poorly and will never return to The Mirage. Overall, the room was very nice and clean, quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. Desk staff were mostly very courteous, friendly and helpful. Bell staff were uniformly very friendly and courteous. My concern with the hotel/room related to booking and check-in. I booked with Orbitz for a room with 2 queen beds. I called after we landed in Las Vegas to see if we could get an early Check-In. I was told that we had a room with one king bed, because we didn't pay an extra fee to specifically reserve 2 Queen beds on a 'Run of the house' reservation, even though the reservation specifies 2 queen beds. After agreeing to pay the extra daily room fee for the upgrade to 2 queen beds, I asked if the upgraded room was available for early check in (regular check in at 3p). I was told yes, it was ready and we could arrive at our convenience. We went directly to the hotel and, arrived around 12:30p. At Check in, they said the room was not ready, but would be ready in 2.5-3 hours. I explained that this was not what was promised, and that after 2.5-3 hours, it wasn't an early check in, but was simply the regular check in time. I was told I would get a text with the room number when the room was ready. We were given room keys (without a room number) at that time so we wouldn't have to come back to the check in desk. At 3:15p, it was after regular check in time and I had not received a text. We returned to the check in desk and were given our room number. Great customer service with the hotel staff. Rare to come by with businesses that service mass amounts of customers Wonderful buffet. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Beautiful hotel. Room was very clean. Enjoyed my stay. Will be back again. We had our family spring break and had a great time!! ! Stayed four nights. Good location on the strip. Enjoyed the pool and the California pizza Kitchen Very pleasant. The room was very comfortable and very clean. I will absolutely stay at this hotel again. Great experience. Nothing negative to say. very happy with the hotel and the room. close walking distance to all the other casinos to GREat place to stay, very clean, great staff, no harassing like in other hotel casinos I visited while on the trip. Close to all the attractions. At the time of our booking, the Mirage had the best rates. Definitely just as nice as others on the strip. Centrally located and within walking distance to many of the Vegas sites. The pool was very nice! We got to the hotel at about 1am and the hotel staff that welcomed us was so nice. I reserved a king bed room and he told us they were all full. He gave us a free upgrade to a two queen bed room with a view on their Stay Well Room on the 12th floor. Best bed and pillows I have had at any hotel. Wow!!! The room was so clean and comfortable. Best staff ever and the hotel was very good. Eat breakfast at Pantry, their food is amazing!! ! Restaurant prices high. Only unpleasant employee was in coffe bistro, rude to customers. One morning, opened door and found a young women sleeping on floor in front of the room across from us. Saw us and  exited the area via the stairs. NCAA weekend get away. Love this hotel. Needs a little polishing around the edges but still a great hotel I had great experience right from check in to check out, clean rooms, courteous staff, great food Our return was as great as our first one. We love this Hotel/casino. Much better than our old favorite Treasure Island. This is first time stayed Mirage hotel in Vegas. I was not happy there charged $15 Parking fees for the customer. That make me turned down there business. No more MGM resorts. Very friendly staff clean and comfortable room   The restaurants are high quality but a little pricey Excellent location near the shopping Mall. Massive pool with lifeguard supervision. Room service was excellent, the only thing negative about the room was the carpet around the edges and under furniture needed a good vacuum cleaning. Plenty of restaurants in the hotel, a cheap breakfast opposite the hotel called Denneys. The Outback Steakhouse also opposite the hotel serves the best steak I have ever eaten. You must try the oyster sauce with it. The Beatles Love cirque du solely was magnificent, worth all the money. Robert i have stayed at the Mirage several times. it is in the middle of the strip so access to most of the strip is easy, i have always found the hotel staff to be very polite and helpful. the restaurants and other shops are very high quality of food and service. i have been to lots of the other hotels and they in my opinion don't offer what The Mirage does, First class hotel and you can't go wrong there for blue for money and service.Top Tip is to get a Mlife card and use it all the time,charge everything to your room and before you check out go to the Mlife desk and ask for comp's to be taken off your room, I've just saved $350 doing this. Stayed in a standard room with 2 queen beds and 2 children. Good size, clean with air con and all essentials. Couldn't use fridge as stacked with bar drinks, but ice and bucket available. Plenty of places to eat at hotel or across the road. Lovely pool but get down at 9am for best sun beds! The trip was very good with excellent flights with United & Air Canada . The Hotel & it's staff were brilliant but they cannot not do any thing about the weather or the strong Dollar. Las Vegas is still a great place to go to if you want to go shopping,Dining out or going to shows. We have been to las vegas before and once again had a fabulous time. This time we stayed at the Mirage Hotel. We enjoyed a comfortable pleasant stay, quite central, clean and had everything you need. We would stay there again. A great hotel right in the heart of the strip. Free parking for those with a vehicle, just drive into multi storey. Clean rooms with good beds. The hotel is in a great location centre strip within easy walking distance of The Fashion Show Mall, Linq Promenade & Forum Shops @ Caesars Palace. The buffet although a little pricey is excellent, at the weekend unlimited champagne in addition to beer & wine.
We stayed at this hotel during a two day trip to Córdoba to see sights. We arrived by bus and left by train so the location was perfect. They checked us into our room early. It is a pleasant walk mostly through a park to get to the area with shops, restaurants, and museums. It is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel to that district. The desk clerks spoke clear English and the hotel was cool and clean. Easy to roll my baggage there from the rail station. The bar was comfy in the evenings. I walked to the old city and the cathedral and back, which was pleasant and safe. Worked very well for travel by train. A lovely modern hotel within walking distance of the major tourist sites in Cordoba. We were grateful for air conditioning that worked well considering the plus 40 degree temperatures we were facing while there. A perfect place to relax in the heat of the day. Walking distance to the train station as well. Hotel was comfortable with underground parking and helpful staff. Breakfast buffet was purchased separately but was a good value. No venting in the bathroom, so the bathroom smells stay in the room, and staff used strong air freshener scent in the lobby, it really turns me off. No ice machines so I had to go all the way downstairs Bar area for ice. Golf ball size of soap, good for look but difficult to use. Stayed here because it’s literally a 2 minute walk from the train station. We got there super early and though no rooms were available yet, the hotel held on to our luggage while we explored the city and got back around 7 PM. Check in was easy, the room was very nice and bed quite comfy. Our only issue (and why we give it a 4 not a 5) is because the room smelled HEAVILY of smoke. The hotel is currently smoke free but I feel like people were allowed to smoke not too long ago and it’s just not a smell that easily goes away. We left the window open with the air conditioning on for a while and it definitely helped. The gym is also nice and the hotel again held on to our luggage until our train later that day. Overall, our stay was fine! Loved this hotel's location a block from the entrance to train station & car rental. Huge yet quiet lineal park across the street. Also a nice long walk by a park to the city center and ancient attractions. Nice friendly staff at front desk and restaurant. friendly people, good ambience,, neat and clean rooms The location and check in staff were friendly. However, during my stay, the reception is slow to respond to requests and enquiries. Whilst they are engaged, further attention can be paid to managing the expectations and the queue in line waiting to be served. Very basic hotel. No coffee or tea making facilities. The bathroom door is a swinging frosted glass door that would be unsuitable for young children. Not much around the hotel. Overall was ok as we wanted somewhere to stay that was close to the station. Staff was unprofessional. Rooms were noisy and hot. There is no air conditioning in room. They call it AC hotel without an Air condoning. First woman on reception fantastic. Got back to hotel at 23.05 bar shut! Night receptionist didn't even acknowledge us on both nights. Receptionist in morning couldn't speak English which I found surprising for a worldwide hotel
Hotel is right in the middle of everything. 10 minute walk to the center of Capri, down the hill to Marina Piccola, or the other way to Marina Grande. Anacapri is about a 10 to 15 minute cab ride. Hotel is very nice. Only thing it is missing is a hot tub. Once the sun went down it gets very cool, a hot tub would give everyone a place to relax and have a drink while enjoying the beautiful view from the pool deck. Overall a very enjoyable experience. Definitely recommend staying here. Stay was awesome from the beginning to the end. We had our transportation arranged by the hotel. We were picked up from Naples Airport and transported to the Port by an excellent driver. He bought our tickets for the ferry and showed us the way to get it. Someone was waiting for us at the Grand Marina in Capri, he took our luggage and was put into a taxi to the hotel. Hotel staff was waiting for us when we arrived. We were warmly welcome by the staff. Breakfast was great and again the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were cleaned and also the pool area. We can not say enough of Emilio who treated us as family. We felt at home and forgot that we were many miles away from our home. Location was excellent. We walked to the square and had the option to eat at some very nice restaurant. I would certainly stay at this hotel again. A big thank you to everyone at Hotel della Piccola. We spent one night and booked last minute. The hotel was in a great location and the grounds were beautiful. The pool area was great and we had a relaxing day of sun bathing, wine, and snacks poolside. The staff was very attentive and gave us a great recommendation for a restaurant that ended up being the best meal we had on the whole trip (Panorama). I highly recommend this hotel! Internet was very poor, everything else about the hotel was beautiful. I highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are generously sized, well appointed and have balconies overlooking the pool and sea. The staff is amazingly helpful. Location was ideal - just a five minute walk to The center of Capri - close to the top of the mountain and right by a bus stop to Ana Capri. Great drinking and excursion recommendations from the staff. Good Hotel, very good location. Nicely presented, nice continental style breakfast They don't provide transfer from the port to the hotel. Location is not bad, within walking distance (10-15 min to piezetta) and (10-15 min to Marina Piccola beach ) Needs updates in the facilities. Pool not appealing. Our balcony is rundown and old. WiFi is hardly working - in and out, super slow. I found the hotel charming/clean, the staff was very helpful. Loved the room's bathroom. I had an oceanview room and it was totally worth it. Would definetly stay here again. Well located property with swimming pool good breakfast and fair price. Would probably return if I went back to Capri. It was lovely and the staff was wonderful- recommend a junior suite or higher! This a nice hotel. Great location maybe a 10 min walk or less to the piazzetta where u can find good restaurants and shops. The staff are very helpful Rosa (I think is her name) helped us book our private boat tour as soon as we arrived to the hotel. Amazing hotel located close to the busy main town but in a quiet relaxing setting. Staff always happy to help and upgraded us free of charge upon arrival to a room steps away from the pool. The pool area itself has sea views and is big but not busy. Rooms are high quality and clean - bathroom was particularly nice. Would highly recommend. We booked this hotel last minute while we were on the ferry on our way to Capri. We had no idea what to expect except that the price was good. Upon arrival, the staff welcomed us warmly and assisted us extremely well. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The breakfast, the pool area, the bar and the location was perfect. I definitely recommend this hotel. We had booked a suite and were delighted to be given an upgrade to their best suite, which was a lovely room with the most enormous bathroom - and a bath with a view! The staff were friendly and very helpful and the buffet breakfast very good. Well positioned in Capri to make the most of a short break of three nights. Close enough to walk to the main square and convenient for the bus to Anacapri which is worth the visit for the town centre and chair lift. Very nice place in the middle of it all, but with an off the beaten track feel. Very friendly and helpful staff, beautiful and large rooms, with plenty of accoutrements to make you feel comfortable. Pool area was small but inviting, flanked by a nice bar serving everything. It's hilly, as is most of Capri, so be prepared for a light uphill/downhill walk on a very nice lane to get to the lobby, but that's part of the charm. You can walk up to Capri town, or down to the nice beach. Expensive place, but very nice! Note - If you use the steam room, be careful of the metal steam jet by the door, at calf-level - my 14-yo son backed into it and had to visit the nearby medical center to treat the burn, and the local pharmacy for supplies and antibiotics! Hotel room balcony was beautiful. We stayed in the best room in the hotel for two nights for our honeymoon before moving on to the Amalfi Coast. Stairs only no elevator, provided porter for bags. One night staff at the desk was rude when we asked some questions about the ferry the following day. Check in was easy. Very upscale hotel, no music at the pool. Bar service at the pool was wonderful. Air conditioning was on its last leg and probably needs to be replaced. Probably wouldn't stay there again, a bit too upscale for our liking - would have perferred a more classic friendly atmosphere. Very good hotel for the money. Good location, close enough to everything, but not directly in the middle of all the daytrippers coming to Capri. Staff very helpful and had great restaurant recommendations. Location quiet but more fitting of three star It was marvelous, the hitel team were friendly and lovely Hotel pictures show how it really looks like. Room was clean and spacious. Quiet area without street noise. On arrival were up graded to a junior suite with a view over the sea. The staff were extremely friendly especially Giacomo who gave us some ideas for places to go and eat. Would stay again if returned to Capri. Would highly recommend All staff, especially Rosa anticipated and resolved every need of guests, even everything around the island and travel to and from the island. So many Honeymooners and older couples loving the beauty and peace of the hotel The hotel was just what we needed. Very nice hotel stuff , helped us with every booking like places to eat , boat , etc. Beautiful gardens, pool and the pool restaurant with probable the best light meals for lunch. We enjoyed it very much and already recommend it to friends and family. Will definitely stay there again Lovely quiet hotel away from the busy crowds but close enough to walk to many places warm and friendly staff
Called the day before for an early check-in. Arrived at 9:30, spoke to Jake at the front desk and he said he did not have two rooms available but to check back at noon. We worked in the Lobby, and kept checking back every with Jake every hours. Jake appeared to careless when both rooms would be available. Finally at 3PM we checked into both rooms. Very Disappointed! However, the room was nice. Shawn at the concierge was great and very helpful recommending various places to dine. The room was very clean, but a little dark, with only a small window. Some additional lighting would be nice. Turn down service with chocolate truffles and cookies and milk (for our daughter) was very thoughtful and much appreciated. Have spent time in other hotel lounges around the world, but King Edward’s lounge definitely makes the grade, especially the wonderful lounge staff! Our only disappointment was that the room only had a shower and no bath - contrary to the photos of the room. Overall we had a good experience, and would consider staying again, as long as it’s a room with a bath. We booked a delux king room and was upgraded to a premier delux. Huge room, stunning. The staff were exceptional and so accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. As it was my birthday they sent up cake. The bed was so comfy and the room spotless. The bathroom has a fantastic walk in shower, plenty big enough for 2. We ordered breakfast to the room, very reasonable price and beautiful food. The lobby is a beautiful area with large chess pieces dominating the area but very tastefully done. A great place to stay. Enjoyed my stay. I can see that the staff give a friendly, proud and high quality of service. I tried out the room service as I will soon be in Toronto with an elderly relative who will rely on it. The food was very expensive and quite low quality. This was the only disappointment. This hotel will not be suitable for a more room-ridden person. Very nice room, modern, clean, and comfortable. Glad we booked our stay here! Overnight parking around the corner on Church Street was convenient and extremely inexpensive. The bed was not as comfortable as the ones at Hilton. We had a wonderful experience at the Omni King Edward. The staff was very friendly and the accommodations were first rate. I would definitely return. We went to see two plays at the Mirvish theatres and we could walk both ways. Couldn't be more convenient. Also so close to the subway and street cars. Great hotel. First time staying here in TO and loved it. Food was great, close to all amenities and walking is a plus. We will defiantly be back. Very nice hotel and very friendly staff .I highly recommend it. Enjoyed the city and its many offerings..dining..shopping...entertainment ++..and a welcoming room to spend the night. A 24 hour convenience store across the road, chocolate bars..night night. Great old hotel with updated rooms. Staff was really nice, gym was good and breakfast was fantastic. I am quite satisfied with my last stay in Omni King Edward Hotel, rooms are renovated, staff is excellent. Never stay in another hotel rather than this in my next visits to Toronto. Room rates are also rational. This was a nice weekend with the family. We had a great time visiting Toronto and Niagara Falls. I booked the premier King room. The room was a good size and include a couch and an easy chair. Hotel staff was professional and very helpful. We enjoyed the modern amenities in this historical hotel. It had a great location for downtown sports, theater and transportation venues. The staff were very helpful. This hotel has a low key elegance with pleasant and unobtrusive staff. Stayed one night during the ice storm in April. Staff was grea. Upgraded our room. Hotel is beautiful. Fitness centre is was good. Great location, close to the underground PAth. My first stay at the King Edward hotel. I love the architecture of this classic hotel. Room was large and extremely well appointed. TV was a little small for the scale of the room,  but I didn’t go there to watch TV!! I am definitely returning on my next trip to Toronto. First rate. Great staff and facility. A lovely hotel with a fantastic hotel bar. The building is old but they have maintained it well. The staff went out of their way to make the time spent there as comfortable as possible. The room was big with all the amenities we could ask for (only wish there was a kettle to make our own tea). Within walking distance of many downtown parts of Toronto. Would highly recommend. Very nice fully updated hotel. Room was perfect, high tea was divine. Charging for wifi in the room is petty. Nothing special about the stay. They actually charged me for a service that should be free. I was told that they have overlooked it. For a hotel with 4.5 stars rating, this is a no-no for me. Great location Great hotel!.Clean, comfortable, and well located within the city. Can walk to anywhere. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Good experience I never write reviews, but I was so impressed by the staff at the King Edward I wanted to share this with others looking for a place to stay. The concierge was friendly and so helpful and Jake at the front desk helped us with our phone and did it with a smile. The gentleman at the door were friendly and helpful. We were always a little lost and everyone helped us find our way and I never felt that they were put out by our request. I stayed at 5 hotels during our trip and this was by far my favorite! Nice and clean Hotel downtown. Spacious rooms. Lacking gym. What a great place to stay! Seriously! The room, staff, location -- fantastic. Our first trip to Toronto, so the hotel pick was a crap shoot - did we ever win. The bathroom alone was the price of the stay! If you can't decide about the downtown hotels, pick this one. LOCATION to the Market, Distillery District, AGO, CN tower, etc....perfect! Omni King Edward Hotel is very beautiful. The room is very clean and comfortable. Our room is large and also has a living room. The hotel staff are very professional. The hotel is in a nice street and is convenient. We loved our stay. It worth every penny. This Hotel was impeccable, and the service was definitely above and beyond what I expected, they accommodated all of my needs.and aided me in having an absolutely hiccup free wedding, thank you again! Love the hotel, the rooms lovely n spacious, bar downstairs very close to shops n amazing restaurants Close to CN tower, the aquarium, lots of amazing shops and restaurants Quiet and great location. Easily accessible to old Toronto, the financial district, eaton Centre, King street as well as Queen. The beds are really comfortable! Stayed here twice in the same week. Just an amazing hotel. Clean and spacious rooms, friendly staff and a fantastic foyer area. Would highly recommend. Stayed at the Omni in downtown Toronto. Great central location close to everything. Hotel was clean and staff were eager to please. Upside- Front desk team were engaged and very informative, lobby was impressive. Health club facility was in very good shape . facility could have used either a sauna or steam bath. Lots of equipment all fully operational. Restaurant was a sleeper with great service, surprisingly broad menu with generous portions. Food was prepared to perfection and the atmosphere was conducive to hold an intimate business meeting where you might need to discuss sensitive matters without fear of being overheard by your neighbours. Servers were in sync with privacy versus interrupting conversations. Prices on the menu were reasonable. Valet team could use a few lessons with their trade. Doors to vehicles were not opened upon arrival. Team seemed like they were not sure what to do with regards to luggage and check in. Head doorman seemed caught up with giving orders and direction rather than getting my vehicle when I needed it for in and out service. Rather than take my ticket, I was directed to the Concierge from the Valet Captain who was more interested in talking on his phone than addressing his direct customer's needs. Too bad, because this was the only negative encounter with our stay. Perhaps better training is needed in this area of the Omni's game. Everything was great except the dining room. We had breakfast in the main dining room four or five times, and it was hit or miss. Either the kitchen or the wait staff was not paying attention when we ordered breakfast. One morning, I ordered three eggs over medium, with no potatoes or anything else. Instead, I got two eggs, one over medium and one well done. Go figure that one out. Another morning, we had an unusually long wait before we received breakfast. The bar area was great. Great service, good food served in a timely manner. My recent stay at the Omni has made me a fan of this chain, the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and decent sized and the bed was comfortable. Interestingly enough the room had no closet which was strange but overall was great. The food provided for snacks and breakfast was great and the coffee was amazing as well. The hotel was pretty centrally located in the financial district so the train and trollys were right there, along with pretty good places to eat. The service was wonderful the room was beautiful, very clean and the location was perfect. It was our anniversary and I truly cannot wait to visit Toronto again and stay at the Omni. Thank you! Great hotel!! Excellent staff!! Only drawback was the spa closed at 3 pm on Sunday In town for concert at Air Canada Center and were looking for a nearby hotel. We were blown away by The King Edward. Absolutely stunning. Visited Toronto to go to the Hockey Hall of Fame and see a Maple Leafs game. Hotel was an easy walk to the venues, restaurants and shopping. Other than the cost of parking I rate the hotel a 5 in all categories. Centrally located in Toronto, nice hotel. Rooms are spacious. Very good service. Gym well equipped. Great stay at King Eddie. Huge guest rooms Attentive staff After noon tea was delightful. Vincent Tran was helpful and kind in multiple ways during our stay Has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Hotel staff is extremely kind you won't even believe it. The hotel is very nice inside and out, and everything is near the hotel that you will need. Will be visiting again in the summer great service, location was great, professional staffs, elegant rooms, Amenities are plentiful and the staff are beyond courteous and helpful. Room was spacious and exceptionally comfortable. Room was big and comfy but the tv was to small. Staff was great especially the doormen they were a wealth of knowledge and are the real superstars here. The best thing of the hotel was not only the historical beauty but also the customer service of each personnel. We were for short periods in lobby or around the hotel on a daily basis, but every time we could see Manager David hands on. He was covering from restaurant to lobby to bar to back of the front desk overseeing and managing everything making sure customer service was the priority. Wonderful visit. Niagara falls was breath taken. AGO and ROM great Nice, clean, historic hotel; however they charged me an extra night at the hotel that I did not stay, and we unable to refund me because of their strict policy. Good location, excellent service, great dining, good value for money. Room was lovely, staff couldn’t have been nicer. Only major drawback was on Monday morning went down for breakfast a bit after 8am with an hour before we had to leave. The place was packed. There were tables set up outside the restaurant also full. We were told at least 5 tables waiting ahead of us. Wait time unknown. Packed and left. Got breakfast outside on our way to the train station. Enjoyed our 3 night stay here. Lobby was beautiful. Room was spacious with a king size comfy bed. A few little things would have earned an extra star. Towels were old & a bit worn. A morning paper would have been nice. TV remote was ridiculously old. Restaurant in lobby had good food & drinks. The Omni King Edward staff was very friendly and was always willing to assist in any way possible. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was amazing. The hotel is walking distance to a lot of great sites such as the Hockey Hall of Fame, train station, subway, St. Lawerance market, and the Distillery District. Great stay all the way around!
With a 7.30am ferry,  all we wanted was a basic but comfortable hotel, with wifi, close to the port. After a surly receptionist checked us in, we found the room was dingy and the bed had a thin, uncomfortable mattress and a bed cover with (what looked to be) chocolate marks. In addition, the wifi was extremely unreliable. You have to walk up 3 flights of stairs before getting to reception so no use for those with limited mobility. As you can probably tell from this review, we won't be back! The rooms in the hotel are clean and well equiped. A small problem is a noise from the street if you sleep in the room with windows towards the street.
I stayed there for two night. I have no complaints apart from the room being very warm even with the heating off. I can highly recommend it and will come again. Quiet town, near shopping area Awesome location. Good solid room with comfortable beds and they listened to my notes/requests. All in all very positive. They do need a sign in room saying the water isn't free in the fridge but other than that..perfect. Free parking and breakfast was a great touch. The breakfast is good! Vienna House is overall a decent hotel located smack dab in the middle of downtown Dornbirn. Easy walk to grocery store, restaurants, and central train station. It's frequented by large tour groups with those long coach buses. Modern hotel, spacious room, nice bathroom, free underground parking directly below hotel. Plenty of restaurants very close. Fabulous breakfast. Good WiFi
Good hotel, close to the beach, and even had an overlooking view from my balcony of the beach, it also has a swimming pool too. Was fairly close to shops and the promenade which has some of the main well known places, further on that leads to the centre of San Antonio, so all in all close enough, I did quite like the walk but its around 10-15 mins which wasn't an issue for me. It wasnt overly loud, but they do some karaoke in some of the close places to the hotel, but is fairly quite I can presume compared to what it may have been like on the other side in the centre. We generally headed out at the times it was on / finishing, if out for the night. You do have some bars and food places 5 minutes from the hotel if you dont have that included in your stay. However we had breakfast and dinner in our package, and both were excellent and well worth paying for, especially if your not sure what to expect or find as it was my first time travelling to this location too, so I would have some meals worst come to worst if  I didnt have a chance or find anything etc. Have stayed in the San remo many times because the standard is always high, food varied and plentiful, bar service efficient, bedrooms comfortable, new aloe Vera mattresses were so comfortable, rooms cleaned daily with fresh towels. Area around hotel has something for every taste, bars, restaurants, nightclub, children's play park,beach with all the water activities, 15 mins stroll around the bay to San Antonio town, all in all great position and fabulous value for the money payed. Hotel is immaculately clean and well presented, as is the restaurant. I found the food to be of a good standard for where I was. Check in took ONE AND A HALF HOURS as there was only one (jobs worth) receptionist on. I arrived at the hotel at 2115 hrs and finally got to my (duff) room at 2350 hrs). A lot of folk missed their dinner. As a single person I am ALWAYS  allocated a duff room, this was no exception. I probably pay more for the room than a couple do (per person) but still get the room over the bar, looking at bins, on the main road, room next to the stairs/lift. This time I was 'treated' to a room facing the main road over a late bar - Deep Joy!! The pool area is lovely but extremely small, I can imagine that in the summer it would not be a relaxing place to be. There wasn't anywhere to sit after dinner unless you suffered the 'Entertainment Team' and their need to scream out songs which mostly sounded like a cat being ironed! Truly painful experience!! And then the loud families whose kids run around whilst they sit drinking = getting louder and louder as the night 'wears' on. Benidorm Crew comes to mind. If you like that sort of holiday then this is ideal - Each to their own. I found it awful and spent most of my time in the evening in my room. Good 3 star hotel! Staff very friendly and helpful! Right on a small sandy beach, lovely sea! A room with a sea view a must, ask for a high floor room, views are wonderful! Really enjoyed our stay! Would return! Had my stag do week of the 15th may, hotel was really good seems like they had painted rooms and bar area also re done the pool. Hotel was close the the beach a Ibiza water sports. Overall great hotel. This hotel is in a lovely area in the bay. It is only a 3 star but is comfortable and is ideal for a budget priced traveller. The staff are friendly and helpful. We only had breakfast but the choice was good. My tip is to pay for a sea view room as the sunrise over the bay is beautiful Poolside entertainment was too loud starting from 10am to midnight. Relentless. Drunk clubbers continued to add to the noise on their return at night. Room wasn't clean. Spent a week in Ibiza at the San Remo. Pleasant hotel within strolling distance of Sant Antoni so easy access to town. We were there before the season gets going in May so lots of things still shut but we enjoyed it being quieter. Only draw back was a bar directly opposite our room but even that shut reasonably early - might be worse in high season. booked a 3 night stay here because i didnt want to spend over $100 a night. Its a minimal hotel. There was a younger girl at the front what was very rude, everyone one else was nice. Upon check in, she asked for my voucher and i had no idea what that was. I had printed out my itinerary for myself, and she demanded i give it to her because that was the voucher. Then she demanded 3 euros for taxes. I offered a CC and she said no, she needed euros. Said she wouldn't allow me to check in. I asked her where the ATM was, and she refused to tell me where, just said: Out there. So i walked around with my bags to find it. Besides the ant problem, everything else was ok. You can walk to other areas from there. Excellent food and good mix of age groups and great atmosphere Rude reception staff, paperthin walls, unclean bathroom, awful beds Very clean hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Food good & freshly prepared with a good choice. More suited to a younger scene. Great hotel. Decent entertainment and beautiful view over San Antonio. Would definitely recommend and will likely stay there again. The hotel is within 20 mins from the airport and its close to the beach with amazing views but the hotel needs a total renovation. The rooms are bare, with poor AC which prompted me to demand a room change upon arrival. The rude receptionist told me no upgrades were available but I managed to get a better room with a view once the AC in my room was broken so the receptionist had lied. The bathroom was so so, with threadbare towels. The beds reminded me of cots and the room lacked decor. I called for an iron and was told I had to leave a €10 deposit to get one. I didn't bother. Overall, this hotel is very low budget. If all you need is a bed in a room with malfunctioning AC and poor customer service, this is the place for you. I will never stay here again.
Good view. Typical Turkish breakfast. Close to Likya Yolu trailhead. A real jewel.Convinient location but still detached.tremendous views of sea and mountains.Only negative is noise from road below. We spent two nights at this hotel and had a very nice stay. The hotel is on a steep hill, so the walk up from the main area of the resort is not for those with walking difficulties. However, the hotel is very well located, is clean and has some lovely sea views. We were half board and the food was very good, although Cornflakes at Breakfast would have been a useful addition. The staff were very friendly and very helpful
The rooms are like in the picture, small but cleen rooms, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Very good location, many pub and restaurants in few min walking distance, metro station also from 1 min ... I was in Paris for three nights, just exploring the city. The staff are nice and helpful  location very convenient  Very clean room The hotel is very good overall, so clean and tidy. The price is affordable with better room. Staff are friendly and accomodating. It’s location is very near to shops, restaurants, fastfood chains.. Very handy hotel, close to the metro and easy to get around. Hotel was clean, room was very small but as we spent most of the day out that was ok It was pretty far away from any of the big attraction spots. Would have liked to have been closer. Very small room.
Check-in was prompt, and we were shown to our room by a member of staff. The room itself was of a high standard, with rainfall shower and the usual hotel room amenities. The view from the room was stunning. The included buffet breakfast was great. No shortage of tables or staff on hand for help. One small issue occurred when the fire alarm went off on our last night. It seems it was apparent to the staff that this was a false alarm, but this was not communicated to guests very well. All guests then had to make their way back up through the (very slow) lift, as the stairs are for emergency use only. Overall, would recommend this hotel. Good location, facilities and view. On arrival we had a very pleasant greeting from helpful staff. We were assisted to our room by Joseph who informed us of everything we needed to know. The room had recently been refurbished and very nice. Bathroom was very nicely done with a walk in shower. The views across Sliema creek looking over to Valletta were fabulous. The hotel has an indoor pool which looked great but we didn't use it. Apparently there is an outdoor pool on the 12th floor but wasn't open at the time we were there. The outdoor terrace was lovely, again with gorgeous views. We were bed and breakfast in the hotel and the breakfast was lovely with a good selection of breakfast items hot and cold. We did make the mistake of eating dinner in the regatta restaurant in the hotel. The food was very poor and cost us €50 for 2 of us. We ate out after that. We stayed for 4 nights and although overall hotel was lovely I wouldn't want to stay longer than a week because there was nothing going on in the hotel. It would not be a good choice for families but ideal for couples. Location of the hotel is great. It's close to the ferry service and local bus services too. Overall I would recommend this hotel for short stays. We didn't have much contact with the staff but when we did everything was great. The location of the hotel was perfect for exploring, close to bus stops and close to the ferry across to Valletta. Lots of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Nice modern hotel with good breakfast and option for buffet evening meal if required only downside is poor television reception in the room Really nice, recently refurbished hotel in great location, 5mins walk to Valetta Ferry and 15mins walk to St Julians. Excellent large contemporary rooms and public areas, great indoor pool. We were on half board and the choice and quality of food at both breakfast and dinner was excellent. The staff were really friendly and customer service was excellent. Five stars all round! ! Perfect location to explore Valletta, great eating spots - all within walking distance. Lovely breakfast room! Would definitely stay here again. Very enjoyable stay. Super hotel in a nice area close to valetta. Food awsome well recommended. Some teething problems in an otherwise good hotel. Initially shown to wrong type of room/ room not cleaned on first day. Only one lift appeared to be working. We were on the new floor, but the finish was weird: paint all over the new carpet and cuts in it as if someone had been cutting tiles or something on it. Oddly for a hotel, there was only a thin sheet covering the mattress, no mattress cover. But these defects were more than compensated for by the fantastic view from the room; the friendliness and efficiency of all the staff, the new stylish decor and the great breakfast. Newly renovated but poorly executed. Paint stains all over the place and and poor fitting of a lot of pieces. Breakfast was a big letdown. Quality over quantity is an advice. Room was clean but had poor lighting over workspace. Poor evacuation of moist in the bathroom. Good location, friendly staff but needs more attention to the execution of the renovation which appears to be nearly completed. In my view a decent 3 star hotel with room for improvement but not a 4 star hotel. This place might be lovely, but not yet. Lots of stuff unfinished, building work etc. Shame as I can see what they are trying to achieve they just haven’t yet Hassle free stay for business. Rooms are comfortable with good amenities, breakfast was fine with a lovely view, wifi works without problems. The hotel has nearly finished a major refurbishment, but there was no disruption during my stay. The location was convenient, but everywhere is in Malta. It is located in a tourist area and I cannot vouch for the summer peak, but I would consider again as very good value. Spacious room   nice shower   good location for sliema and 5 mins from ferry to valetta Satisfactory Great Hotel, fully renovated with wonderful surroundings. Rooms are excellent. Buffet breakfast is a must have and the views are stunning. This is situated handy to ferries, buses, boat tours and shopping. No need for a rental car Our harbour view room had a balcony & fabulous views over that gorgeous harbour. This hotel is in a great location close to ferries, buses, gelaterias, cafes & bars. Good buffet breakfasts, very helpful & polite staff. Decor is a bit tired but other than that it's a comfortable hotel. Worth paying a bit extra for that stellar water view room.
Can't recommend this place highly enough, stayed in places with more stars not nearly as good as this little gem. Everything from quick response on email before arriving to super easy check-out. When arriving at the airport you can take bus no. 60 to Santa Catalina bus station (blue Global buses). It leaves 15 min past the hour, cost EUR2.95 one way and takes about 30min. Hotel is about 15min walk from the bus station. Upon arrival I was please to check in an hour early but even more to find I'd been upgraded to a Superior Suite :) There's a lift in the building if in need. The Suite itself was very clean and comfortable, the kitchen had all the required amenities even a little treat box with a few tea bags, chocolates, water etc. Lovely bathroom with a proper hair dryer, not one of those little flimsy ones you find attached to the wall in many 4* hotels. I'm a light sleeper but found the bed to be very comfortable. Regarding noise, I found the windows blocked quite a lot of when closed, the aircon was fairly quiet (didn't keep me awake) and yes, you can hear the neighbours but only if they are inconsiderate and slamming doors/loud music which I was lucky enough to escape. Round the corner from the beach, plenty of supermarkets, shops and restaurants especially loved Taberna Chica for their delicious fish and steak dishes. I'd never stay anywhere else if ever in Las Palmas again :) For the money I paid, I've no complaints whatsoever about the hotel itself - although it's not really a hotel, what you get is a self-contained apartment with daily maid service (which was excellent). The problem is the location: I stayed there for 2 weeks so go to know it well, and there are homeless people sleeping in the doorways near the hotel, I saw two people smoking what I assume was an illegal substance while squatting under the alcove of the building, and there were two young women regularly hanging around the area who may or may not have been prostitutes and/or drug dealers. So, probably not the place to take the kids! The Hotel is situated a short walk to beach, which is amazing but it's in a busy residential part of Las Palma so daytime traffic noise can be a bit of a problem if you like a siesta. Some of the other guests were regular door slammers and a bit loud but I suppose that's to be expected. On the whole I enjoyed the experience and would consider using the same hotel again. From outside looks nothing, but my room had just been refurbished and was nice. Had air con, which was a plus. Reception staff very helpful with everything. Very helpful staff, hotel is very near to the beach. Easy check in,clean pleasant room containing all facilities,very close to sea front and shops and restaurants. A friendly welcome despite the late arrival and generally very helpful Very good little apartment. Very close to the beach. Only issue was the noise in the stairs. The staff was very helpful, assisting with everything they could and giving great tips. Very clean, tidy and comfortable. Convenient, friendly staff, easy check in, good clean place Close to beach The management of the hotel knows well how to make the guests comfortable by making available all what is needed by travelers. Cleanness is super, the little complete kitchen is a big plus when the guest wishes to eat in the room. Even there are extras nice gestures like tea bags, coffee capsules, and hot chocolate. The location is superb with many supermarkets, restaurants nearby. The beach is less than 5 minutes walking. Thank you Hotel Bajamar Conveniently situated for visiting the port on business. Hotel is also very close to local beaches. Lovely stay as a whole, super clean and nice decoration. Only problem was that the staff did not speak English very much and also the room was not that soundproofing.
Our room was lovely, very clean and comfy and everything worked as it should. The hotel was also very clean and well kept along with the pool and short stroll from the beach (I've seen reviews about the walk up the hill if you're in beach side apartments but there's a bus all day!). However, paid for breakfast only and pretty glad because we were lucky if we got yesterday's left overs and a Luke warm! Although stick to pancakes, an omlette or cereal as a tip and all will be fine! The staff were good. Having stayed in various 4* and 5* hotels, this one does not compare with its rating. The hotel rooms are dated with no in room facilities, the beds are the most uncomfortable I have slept in and the linens are full of stains, the bathroom was dimly lit and you can hardly see what you are doing let alone get a decent shave. The breakfast was much better as it catered for everyone, vegetarians and meat eaters with everything you could want for breakfast. I'm sure I read that it's adults only hotel and was surprised to see children everywhere. Don't get me wrong I love children and the hotel is good for families with young children because they provide enough facilities to keep the children entertained, why I was surprised at the adults only statement on the site (perhaps not at their busiest time). There are lots of restaurants for a long stretch of the road serving variety of foods. Easy and cheap bus ride into town from outside the hotel. Good selection of food for breakfast and dinner. Nice pool Location is up a hill but otherwise good for shops etc  Nice shower Nice room  Staff apparently cannot change guests rooms after a certain time, seems amazingly incompetent. Pool closes too early, not nice being kicked out before the sun has even gone down. Not everyone wants to swim in the sun and get burnt/skin cancer. Some sort of system for showing that dinner tables are occupied would be good Service at dinner for drinks was slow Sea view room overlooks carpark - would have been nice to know this beforehand. Don't like things like this being hidden when you pay a lot of money and extra for a certain type of room Excellent hotel with a private beach. situated from the beach and up the mountain with different buildings. The view from our room was breathtaking. The food was fresh and of very good quality specially the local Cretan food. All the areas of the hotel we used were very clean. The hotel personnel was very friendly and answered all of our questions they even let us borrow their cellphone chargers. I will definitely go back to this hotel in the future and recommend it to our family and friends. this is a great hotel, rooms are clean tidy coffee/tea in room plenty of drawer and cupboard space and to say this room was suppose to be a partial sea view it was awesome. there are 3 bars, beach pool and main bar.both beach n pool have snack bar.beach towels are provided for a refundable £10.00(you can change the beach towels as many times as you like ,there's a hidden little gem of a pool with plenty of sunbeds just to the side of the hotel  when on the beach you can walk into the galini hotel on the beach and order the golf buggy to come pick you up and take you back up to the hotel free of charge. the bus stop to chania is 5mins from hotel and for anyone whose thinking of staying here there's a local train fun rides doing quite a few excursions well worth the price plenty of places to eat and drink in the local vicinity The hotel was very nice and all the staff were very freindly, helpful. The food was excellent. I had a fantastic holiday with my friends. Wouldn't be going back here, not worth the stay. Rooms are not clean and food was mediocre, location is ok but hotel is up on a hill which you have to climb up everyday or wait for the shuttle bus to take you every time. Entertainment was good but the facilities were not and going half board shouldn't be an option if people are going to be treated that horribly. just what we wanted for a total relaxing holiday. as described you get a sea view from hotel, the hotel's beach facilities are superb where the sea view is even better especially at sunset. there is a choice of swimming pools with excellent loungers. Certainly not 5 star - maximum 3 star +. Most staff not interested in giving good customer service. Bed linen dirty. Spa poorly managed and a joke - electricity not working, building work going on during treatments, I doubt my therapist had any qualifications. We really enjoyed our stay with you. In fact we enjoyed it so much that we will be booking two weeks with you next September. A little too expensive in comparison to the hotels around it and for not much more. We stay in hotel 6 nights,  ppl nice easy going, we came in the room, the room locking old, tv was below standard for a 5 star hotel most hostel have better,  bed old, bathroom nice and big, balcony few nice,  We had lot off noise around 11 till 0100 in the night from the restaurant, that was not oke  Overall it was oke I would grant the hotel not more than 3 stars, We were bed and breakfast so to us it seemed everyone was herded into breakfast, lunch and dinner. Large hotel, not a particularly nice resort either. Nice hotel but not 5 star. The food was ok, nice breakfast. Drinks in the bars very basic unless you pay extra. Our room with sea view was pretty and clean. Friendly staff but not enough bartenders. My stay at Galini Sea View was simply terrific... Everyone was super helpful from the front desk all the way down to the valet drivers. Special thanks goes out to Zambia the beach/event cordinator who set up an amazing trip to see the gorgeous beach of Balos, which is a must see. And I couldn't forget the Eden Spa, where I spent much of my time at... Their services and staff were superb and I felt like one of the family by the end of my trip. Thanks :) This is not a 5 star hotel. It might tick most of the boxes but there were a lot of minor deficiencies which were not consistent with a 5 star rating. The room was quite small and the two single beds were not very comfortable. The specification said the room could take a double/two singles and one double sofa bed but there is no way that another bed would have fitted in the room. Also we had to ask for tea/coffee making facilities even though they were listed as standard. Even then someone appeared with a kettle but no tea/coffee or cups! Also free water was supposed to be provided but when we asked for replenishment we were told that it was only on arrival!! The fridge was just about working. We had a shared pool (shared by 8 rooms) but the sunbeds were wooden and no covers were provided until we asked. Then it took 4 days for them to arrive. Breakfast was quite poor with most hot food lukewarm at best. The best option was to take an omelette which was cooked to order and was good. For dinner and lunch the food was ok  if not always as hot as one would have liked. Also the selection of fresh fruit was quite poor (no bananas or grapes) and the quality of some fruits was bad. On the credit side the staff were quite friendly and tried to help but one got the impression that it was badly run. The hotel is located on a hill about 100 metres from the beach with a steep incline so it is not suitable for anybody with mobility issues. A bit disappointing Very good hotel with exceptional staff. We stayed as a couple in a double sea view room with shared terrace and pool. Each room on the terrace is allocated two solid wood sun loungers with a fantastic view over the pool to the ocean. We only stayed B&B so can't really comment on the AI part. The surrounding area is very hilly with some steep inclines so not for the infirm or those with mobility issues. The hotel does provide a large golf buggy which runs back and forth all day up until 22.00pm. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. The only thing we didn't like is that we  had a checked in for a double bed but in  reality there were two single beds.. Overall would not return, dirty looking place for the money!!! Good breakfast but rooms are outdated and old All staff very friendly and helpful. The food was really nice. Bedding and curtains need replacing. Very bad smell from bathroom we stayed in room 4204 but even though some of the faults we had a lovely stay ! !
Location was good with easy to found different types of foods. But hotel very old with poor conditions. There was some stain on the pillow like didn't change at all. The chair in the room also full of stain. It make me feel disgusting. We requested a hair dryer, but served with broken hair dryer. Phone inside the room was also broken. Couldn't call to house keeping or reception as well. Until we saw the housekeeping outside the next door room. Then only may requested for the hair dryer. Unfortunately it was already damaged. Dirty...dirty...  utterly dirty... bed sheets strained with blood and god knows what else... mouldy rooms... unbearable smell since you step in. No towels unless you make a big fuss and then you would get them about 3 hours later after repeatedly demanding them and finally not moving from reception. The biggest rip off I have ever faced on a holiday. The pictures on the website are not the reality. On our arrival we were asked for more money to get a decent room. After refusing and spending a night in a dingy room I managed to be moved to a supposed a better room (Deluxe or according to the staff an executive room)...  phones do not work either... so everyone every time you need something you have to spend 10 minutes in a poorly working lift....hot like a sauna. The state of this hotel falls below any acceptable standard. What an appalling experience!! I've never seen so many people complaining at once with equal situations.. If that the way that tourism gets treated in Kuala Lumpur, well... I will never come back.. This hotel is centrally located on Bukit Bintang, which is about the only good thing I can say about it, although their can be a lot of noise at night time as it's next to the nightclub area. To be fair, the reception staff were efficient and very helpful. We needed to change rooms and this was expedited efficiently. My problem lies with the service staff, who were very unhelpful and, in actual fact, obstructive. We needed extra towels because the shower curtain is too short to drop inside the bath, resulting in continually wet floors. We managed to 'win' a couple of extra towels when we changed rooms but the service staff would not let us keep them. When I insisted on doing so they actually came back with security! I was not happy. It's not the way to treat a paying customer. The hotel is now in poor condition and needs a top to bottom refurbishment. Loose tiles and fittings in the bathrooms; in need of a repaint; not enough sockets in the rooms. They should close each floor in turn and do the work required to bring it up to standard. The room was not as clean as in the photo. The room lighting was not bright and the facilities look old and not well maintain. 1.Need better professionals 2.Neglected by the property owner Staff helpless 3.Lift, escalator,few floors etc under renovation 4.Depending on booking wifi,tv channels etc restricted 5.Most ideal location in entire KL for shopping ,fun and all social activities, clubs ,night clubs , musical area till 4 am The staff was kind and helpful. The room was good but could be improved. The hotel is in the center of the action an close to main transport services. Check in too late..arrive early than check in time..no consideration.. the room are really not clean and the room facilities are not good at all. as i have been told its renovated room but all the towel rack and cabin-ate were falling apart. only i can recommended good about the hotel is everything is close by. over all 4 out of 10 Dirty hotel, uncomfortable beds. Good location  No WiFi for guest. Ideal for budget travellers. Condition of the room is decent considering the amount you will pay. Restaurants and commuters are nearby. Hotel is old.Escalator to the frondesk at the lobby not working.No service phone in the room.Lights are dim.Linens are old and worse is that there are many bed bugs crawling in the bed.Really disappointing although the location is good. On arriving at about 7pm only a couple infront of me took 20m to checkin. The hotel need to employ more staff. I booked a premium room, woke up on 1st morning and itching back looked in mirror red bite marks all over back and on arm =bed bugs. After shower went to reception and requested new room they said wait 2hours as 12pm. I took of t-shirt to show back to everyone in reception and said change my room now so they did and new room no bed bugs. I think the hotel try it on they put people in a room with bed bugs and hope you don't have an issue, instead they need to replace the matress or duvet with a new one, otherwise this will continue. Had a long wait for check-in. The booking shows Tuan Puan Chew which was different from my presented ID. The reception manned by foreign personnel, thus they were not aware that Tuan Puan means Mr. Mrs. in Malay language thus they delayed my check-in without clarifying with me on the difference. The hotel is old and the general maintenance of common areas is poor. The room desk was not cleaned with sticky substance and the toilet bins were not cleared. This is worst hotel we have stay,there is bed bug on the bed and bites my daughter whole hand and leg we even snap photo how the bug moving around the bed,we told the reception to change the room but they still give us the room with bed bug that is 12 th floor room The check in was slow and unprofessional. Room below average. could do with an upgrade on the rooms but for the price I paid and the excellent location, it was a great deal I don't remember the hotel ever being so run-down. There were tiny roaches in the bathroom. No phone in the room to contact housekeeping / reception. No shower cap. And I had booked a deluxe room. The mattress was sunken in the centre. But the breakfast was not too bad. The location is superb. Was recommended but don't stay unless it's for a desperate one night. Housekeeping staff asked for a tip BEFORE cleaning the room. Bed linen was old  and threadbare..bugs on the floor and on the bed. However the pool was great but no towels available. Maybe the premiere rooms are better but only stay if on a budget. tv set suck & no wifi,telephone & safe box. It's just an old hotel, broken escalator, no WiFi in room, old tube TV, no telephone in room (I couldn't call the house keeping to request for iron and board), not going to stay there anymore. Chairs at lobby area for guest to rest but their security guard is empower to wake you up if found you are nap on chair at lobby area while we are waiting to register for check-in. Not comfort to stay at this hotel. Rest way restricted. Tower very dirty, bed very hard to sleep. No wifi, Hotel is old rundown mould own windows cagrpey stained. Smelt Musty sheets and pillows smelt musty bed hard felt springs. Mouldy shower curtain. Tilescoming off bath. Very noisy outside. Only good thling was its location. Bookedl 3 nights checked out after first. Every thing was bad except location. Never stay again. 3 different staff worked for checking us in. Our confirmation was OK by Orbitz. They waited us almost 30 mins and they did nothing at this time. They were rude. Asked the same basic questions 3 times and still could not succeed checking us in. They could not find the confirmation number even I show the number by finger. They do not know where to look to read the Name on my passport. Staff do not know how to do their job. Smells smoke in the room (it was on non-smoking floor). Very noisy even at late night. Sheets were not clean. Water drops from the closet. Bathroom was always wet. Old hotel, dirty window,nice view.tchtchtcjyfjyfjygjyfjgchcff Boccaccio gffcvhhu vcxdft. Handful Hoffa The staff was very polite, honest, and in general great. The facilites of the hotel i.e., the pool, gym, and the hotel rooms were run down and needed a deep cleaning. They also did not have any deck chairs at the pool and everything needed to be power washed. It was OK but there is better value in that area if you take a step of the main street. It will also be easier to sleep due to street noise.
Stayed here for 5 days during international music trade fair WOMEX. Extremely convenient for ICC, theater and all venues. Clean, comfortable, with friendly staff. Breakfast was good in the adjoining restaurant, although the choice of a hot breakfast was limited to scrambled eggs and sausage, but  the menu for other meals was very limited, and the quality below par.
We had purchased a studio king suite but they oversold, so we got a free upgrade. We had an amazing time. Mondrian is one of my favorite places to stay in LA. Service wasn't that great but could be because of the appalling American tipping culture. We really enjoyed the uniqueness of the hotel. We also had an excellent Bellman who went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable! Everyone there made us feel welcome and very accommodating. It was great, housekeeping made sure our room was kept spotless every day. The hotel turned on their music every morning at 7am in the sky bar; the music wasn’t turned down from the night before so we woke most mornings from the blaring music. You’d think someone would turn the volume down before turning the music on. The hotel is located on Sunset in West Hollywood. Beautiful views. The hotel is very clean but tired. Terrible mattress in the 1 bedroom suite. I'd probably stay next door at The Jeremy for a newer property at a similar price. Overall, if you can get a better rate compared to other hotels, I would stay again. Always a great place to stay. Service is great, rooms are fantastic and vibe is sensational. I really don't have a bad thing to say about the Mondrian. The staff is pleasant and accommodating. The rooms are kept up in great condition. They genuinely care about your stay and are there to help if you need it. Only thing I didn't like was someone pounding on my door at 3am. But that has nothing to do with the hotel and wasn't their fault. So I give them 5 star rating I love this hotel. We found great entertainment very close, the room was great and unique and the sky bar within the property was awesome. Great Building is very old. You could hear doors slamming along the hallway and whenever my neighbor opened their door, it would shake my door causing me to sleep very bad for both nights. Housekeeping was rude, opened my door even when I had a DND sign on. meh. was underwhelmed by the experience. not sure what all the hype was about. bar was dead. Chic & trendy. Close to everything. Bit noisy though if your room right above pool party. Helpful staff. Suggest to have free in room free wi fi - good for international traveler (we know it is not free end of day,  of course). Amazing hotel in an amazing location! Will be back! Updating is needed. The sky lounge and pool were closed for repair but I would say there was a lot more in need of repair. Dingy elevators and hallways with dirty carpet. I had a view of an abandoned building. Reserved a kind size bed and definitely received a queen, no way that was a king. Bed was at least comfortable. I ordered french toast for breakfast, and I am all for speedy service, but it arrive in less than 5 minutes which really made me question it's freshness. The bread appeared to be pre-packaged. Overall, the hotel was disappointing. This hotel is beautiful, convenient and had fantastic service. The staff was nothing but friendly, and the location couldn't be better. However. Our hair dryer caught on fire, while I was using it. There is no way to take a shower without the entire room being able to watch you, as there is a window and only a thin curtain that you can see through covering the area. Neat with my 2 teenage kids. The room service was inedible, actual burn marks on the pancakes and uncooked (not under cooked) eggs. Also apparently French Toast is made differently there; with only, well, bread and a very hot griddle. Stay here, take cute West Hollywood pictures, and then eat at Mel's and BRING YOUR OWN HAIR DRYER! My husband and I visited LA for the first time and stayed at the Mondrian in West Hollywood. Great hotel with an awesome vibe, rooftop pool and a great view from our balcony. Perfect hotel! Clean room! Friendly people! Great view! And the pool parties are the best! The location is close to everything - walk of fame; night life; Beverly Hills We got an upgrade upon arrival and they provided free wifi. Great location in west Hollywood! Nice hotel, excellent views and staff. Lots of nice restaurants around and about 35 min drive to Malibu beach. Skybar was nice in the evening with a great crowd and music. Wouldve been nice if offered any complimentary services to their guests who stay for a week though. overall it was very comfortable but pricey. It was loud from the sky bar the first night we tried to sleep there. Getting a bit rundown shower had a buzzing sound and no pressure at all. Pool area very small without much seating. Great hotel with lots of style. Restaurant was really really good The staff seemed to be always on autopilot. They were not very catering. If you asked a question they acted like you didnt belong there. Things were missing in my room. The food was awful. I expected tge room to be bigger and better from the pictures used to advertise. Overall we were disappointed. Beautiful hotel and very comfortable room with a view! Charged $10 per day for wifi and room service food was mediocre, but overall a pleasant stay! Decent hotel, but I wouldn't stay at this hotel again if I were to come back to LA. I rather pay more for a better hotel. The hotel was overall lovely as the swimming pool area and restaurant has it's special charm, especially at night. Rooms are pretty good size and nice elegant decor. At that time full of young, vibrant foreigners. Will definitely come back. Everything is just excellent   amazing staff hamza is beyond excellent you guys should promote him . Cute rooms. Friendly staff. Close to everything. I will definitely stay here again. Spacious rooms. The restaurant is quite pricey. I wish I would have known of the every weekend pool parties they host. Tons of early 20's partiers, most were not guests of the hotel. The pool was unusable due to this. I would have liked to use it but it was full of partiers with inflatables. No where to sit. The bar & restaurant would not let me charge my room for payment. The front entrance to the hotel was also hard to access. Sounds nice from the description... staff not helpful... pool is public ... so no one cares if they help you. the hotel is outdated , small and very noisy  very small pool almost no amenities Got back to room at 6pm day two of stay and room had not been cleaned. Room service NEVER showed up with ice. You see the typical Hollywood-type crowd at the hotel lobby and Sky Bar, an experience to be had in Hollywood.
This is a nice hotel for the price. Most of the hotels in this area are very outdated so that is to be expected but the rooms are nice for the price. The dealers were all very friendly from our experience. The only complaint I had is that we arrived on a Friday afternoon to check in and had to wait in line close to 30 minutes. They only had 2 people working to check in guests. This was our second time staying here and I would definitely stay again. not happy about resort fee. not that much just didnt expect it Best deal in t own. Always try  and stay at Edgewood when in Laughlin. Really enjoyed our stay Wonderful stay for 5 nights at the EDGEWATER HOTEL IN Laughlin. Room was very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was big. I am grateful that the Edgewater took good care of us starting from the front desk to convenient TV checkout. Residual smoke smell from adjoining casino but clean and cheap. We would stay again. Stay was good . the resort fee is a gimmick to get extra money . wifi which is supposed to be part of resort fee is poor. I was there for 7 nights and couldn't get connected the whole time. I could go other places and get connected eithout any trouble. Amazing time only complaint rooms need a coffee pot It was a great stay and value. We usually stay at Harrahs, however the price was so much better. Plus $5 resort fee vs. $15 at Harrahs per night adds up. They give you free coffee coupons which you can use at any bar and then you don't have to wait in line at Duncan's Dounut. We stayed in the  Sedona Tower this time and the room was very nice compared with the Santa Fe Tower. It’s worth requesting the Sedona Tower. The pool was nice as was the view of the river. The room was dirty and noisy, the service was rude, and the bed was hard. We couldn’t sleep because of the noise, so we got up and left at 2 am. I would not say there again if it was free The stay was just OK. I liked the professional customer service. I was just disappointment with the lack of up to date expectations that I had. Such as USB outlets that most hotels have. The swimming pool needed a lot of work. There were cracks and tiles missing. Rooms were clean and nice. Hotel and casino staff were rude. The wife and I hit a jackpot and shortly after were told we could not gamble anymore. The staff at front desk during check out also rude. I'll stay at the Aquairious next time. The room was clean a.f comfortably. The casino is smoky and the pool leaves a lot to be desired. Was a decent hotel. Kept decently clean. Nice bar overlooking the water. Staff was friendly. Biggest disappointment was that it seems the hotel shuts down early. You can't get anything to eat after 10pm or so. All of the restaurants and everything shut down really early. It's a casino in Nevada there should be at least something to eat at midnight 1 in the morning... I don't like the casino part of the floor is small. And for all they don't have the prices went from really cheap to stupid expensive all because of an event. Well that's great but I'm expecting more than just a place to sleep... We found a cigarette bud under our bed, which means the room wasn’t cleaned good. The shower was disgustingly dirty plus it would get clogged. Our balcony door didn’t lock the normal way. While there one staff members was completely unprofessional yelling at a customer, it didn’t need to get to that limit. I think the whole casino heard what was going on, no matter what the situation was she didn’t need to treat the elderly customer that way! Room was not clean, straws under bed, face and fingerprints all over window, dirty handprints on the inside of the room door, hair in the shower. Husband got bit by something (spider?) in bed on the last night. Great location, but needs serious updating in the rooms. Pretty rough bathroom, toilet so old, its like sitting on the floor, didn't flush well. Staff was always friendly. Not much going on in this hotel, we walked to others for nightly entertainment. The Edgewater is a very nice hotel. We stayed in the Sedona tower. Room was clean and nice. Walls were a little beat up but the beds were nice and clean bathroom. The buffet however was terrible. The food was bland and terrible service. No plates were available and 5 staff members had to be asked in order to get some. You are much better off going to Cocos or another casino. The Hickory pit is very nice and very high quality. The pool was semi warm and clean. All around a great experience and killer price. Will be coming back soon. Only had one right as I was passing through and   had a great night with an awesome riverview room. Enjoyed my free coffee rhe next morning. The only major complaint was no coffee in the room,  We were given a slip for a free cup of coffee but stand in line after shower and getting dressed. We prefer to get have coffee and get ready. The price for the room was very good so it is ok. Hotel was below expectations. Windows were very dirty room was old and in need of updating. One of the beds had blood on the sheet. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned. Had to use 2 hands to open bathroom faucet. Very disappointed. Will choose another hotel in the future. Housekeeping never came to our room, had to call for fresh towels. Shower was ridiculously; shower head lower than my head (I'm 5'4), water was either boiling hot or iced cold. We had great view of Columbia river from our room.have stayed here previously. Would come again . We had a very nice time at the Edgewater. From the moment we checked in, the staff was very friendly, they even upgraded our room to a suite. Had to stay in Laughlin one extra night after getting into car accident. After reserving our room the check in was fast and the staff was very courteous. Put us in a smoking room but was changed quickly after informing staff. Would definitely stay here again. We had a great experience at the Edgewater. The location was perfect, great friendly staff. My only negative was the Friday night Buffet. The buffet was the worst buffet I have ever been to. Everything was dried out, over cooked, even the prime rib was well done. A lot of the items were not even warm. I will NOT go back. have a hard time understanding how anyone could give this place a good review. Maybe there are good rooms somewhere in this hotel but everything that I saw points to a tired, old dirty hotel that has no business being listed on Expedia. It starts with the entry outside just brick and stone and cement no inviting feature Enter the lobby and its dark, grand smelly. Reception is the bed was so bad .1. I COULD FEEL THE SPRINGS IN THE MATTRESS. 2. THE BATHROOM DRAIN IN THE LAVATORY WAS PLUGGED . 3.THE ROOM ITSELF NEEDS PAINTING AND CLEANED UP !!! 4. NO COFFEE POT OR FRIDGE IN THE ROOM . 5. HAD TO STAND IN LINE FOR COFFEEFROM DUNCAN DONUTS Our room was nice and clean. The only complaint I have is the mattress on the bed closes to the window was broken down. It was like sleeping on a bag of straw and wanted to roll you off the bed. We will use your hotel in the future,one bad bed should not and could not keep use from staying with you in the future R.E.Betcher It was comfortable  sleeping there . It does need some touch of painting here n there . Few of the staffs on the floor were grumpy . Overall majority of them were helpful . Everyone we came across was so friendly and helpful. The front desk girl was super fun and happy as well as the gift shop staff. Only drawback was no fridge or coffee maker in the room but at these great room rates I can't ding them for that. It was a pleasant experience.didn't win nothing but had lots of fun When we first got there they only had 2 people in the check out desk and we literally had to wait in line for 40 minutes to check in. They were very slow and seemed to not care about their job. Many other people in line were complaining of the service as well and the extremely long wait. Rooms and hotel very very outdated. When we opened the window for some fresh air the window jams had bugs and very dirty. Bathtub was very soft and we felt we were going to fall thru.....that is how soft it was and sink had a leak so every time it was turned on our feet got wet and water leaked on the floor. They really should do something about giving out the free coffee at Dunkin Donuts as the wait in line was just ridiculous just to get a free cup of coffee. They should think about putting small coffee pots in the rooms like other hotels. Would never stay there again. First off reserved and paid for a King bed. Front desk said one was in the room, but it was a queen. 15% and 20% of the slots were out of order as were the bathrooms in main casino area. Have stayed at this place many times over the years, sorry to see it in such poor shape. Bathrooms had no maintenance needed paint and bath tub was with mold all around It was nice the only problem we had were the beds. The beds were a little too hard for our taste. Everything else was ok. Good food choices. Buffet was reasonable for both breakfast and dinner. If slots are your choice this will work. Table games, noy so much. For the price paid it was a lovely experience. I paid $20 a night. I cannot complain at that price. The staff was excellent my dog got hurt jumping off the bed and they helped me get him to the car give me directions to the vet and he was taking care of my car was given to me very quickly and cool down couldn't ask for a better stay The staff was amazing. Everyone we encountered was GREAT. The rooms were decent. They've up graded furnishings which are nice but minor fixes like paint, hole repairs and things in the bathroom were needed. Not a major thing. The beds and pillows were comfy. No coffee pots in the room BUT they do give you vouchers for free coffee from the Dunkin' Donuts downstairs which is a MAJOR pain because you have to wait 30-40 minutes for a cup of coffee. The hotel in Williams and Grand Canyon were really nice. Didn't have any problems and look forward to going again when it's warmer. Our room was always clean, with clean towels every day. It was quiet and easy to sleep. Would stay here again. Price was good with no hidden resort charges. rooms clean and neat. staff very friendly. The Water View room has a high window that you need to stand up and walk over to in order to see the river. Air conditioning is a wall type unit which is very noisy. Hotel is very tired and stale. Hotel Buffet was horrible with food that was barely edible due to its' staleness. Hotel could not provide any extra pillows. The pillows on the beds were small and flat. The front desk manager was not nice or friendly about us adding a 2nd night and we cancelled. It was hot in the hallway. The day shift (hotel clerk, bar guy and cashier) people were great. The night shift (manager at the front desk and bar guy) were not. Travelocity's lady was great about giving our refund. Love the edge it's the bomb! Everything was ready fast,efficient check-in Hotel ok but maid service could do a little better job It was really nice. A getaway for my husband and I. Time was great. Got the room for my husband's birthday. It was great The room and halls stink of sewer. The room was old and dirty. There is no in room coffee available. Not a maker or room service. The ice machine leaked if worked at all. I would never stay there again, not even for free. Our tire was slashed in valet parking sometime during our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even printed our airplane tickets for us at no additional cost. Clean rooms, comfy beds. The parking availability lacked a lot to be desired. Other than that we were very pleased with our stay. Valeria checked me in at the Edgewater Hotel. She did an excellent job. The room was very clean and had a great view of the Colorado River. Plenty of cold AC when needed. The other staff of Tammy, Ana, Michelle  and others were friendly and did awesome. The breakfast buffet had many items and the omelets were great also. The roast beef at the dinner buffet was very tender and tasty. Unlike  large places, this is just the right size. A very friendly place with the right price that will fit most budgets. I look forward in returning on my next visit. The room was cheap and pretty much you get what you paid for. there over night, was very nice. didn't have a chance to play the slots. had a river view room, but had to be standing up to see the river. I've been staying here over 30 years and actually prefer the smaller (original) building though the newer Sedona Tower rooms are very nice. Big Sportsbook (Hill) , good buffet, Dunkin Donuts Coffee, nice pool. It was okay if you want to do nothing because the room had nothing other than a TV with a few channels, no coffee pot, no refrigerator, Been staying here in Winter on/off for decades, new parent company Marnell Gaming has well invested in property and it's paying off ! They make it attractive to stay, eat and play - and that's up to you ! Very clean, spacious rooms, friendly staff, great affordable buffet and fine eats too - all in the center of the Riverwalk. Enjoy :) ! Great food places. The sub place is the BEST!!!! Very comfortable and easy to find your way around. I will stay there again. Good variety of machines. I can hardly wait until the pool is open so I can take advantage of it. My son was there with his son - late at night and the front desk was very rude. My stay was okay. Good parking location and close to other casinos. My room was dirty and had ants. The bartender was a jerk, miserable employee. Started off with a nice valet guy. Got checked in quickly. Room clean. Played a few hours on machines. Took walk on the river walk. It was a good few days there. Very nice get away. Will definitely tell friends and will come back again. the hotel stay was OK...But, the food at the buffet was terrible!! The prime rib was from the night before...fatty and terrible! Not worth 19.99 It would be really nice to have a map of the area. There are so many advertisements that it's hard to tell where each restaurant is actually located. Went to see Olivia Newton-John and the event center was very nice.My room was average.Older building but I felt comfortable.Enjoyed my stay overall. All good except 5' high Shower head on 3rd floor of the small tower Coffee pot would be nice. Clean room s  Love it when I win Not good. Would not stay again. just a bad experience. Vouchers for coffee and you stand in line for 30 minutes. The room over looked the adjacent roof which had air conditioners running. The noise was constant all through the night. Nice hotel wrong room. Registration line, very long. Staff was both efficient  and pleasant. Good but a bit old. Needs a lot of updating. Especially on the elevator
We were impressed with this hotel. Rooms are spacious and well equipped as per website. Meals are buffet style and there is wide choice in the all inclusive package. The staff were all very helpful and the waiters in particular were friendly and offered every assistance. The location is attractive being on one end of a long sandy beach. Views stretch out over the attractive bay over the Aegean to Samos. And, with a dolmus stop right outside, so getting to nearby towns was cheap. Beach is narrow but the sea is very clean and clear. The beach shelves gradually so it is super for swimming, even for small children. Minor gripe for us would be the fact that smoking is allowed in open air restaurants - not inside. That is a british thing though. Many guests were Turkish or east europeans who smoke. Tusan is a beautiful hotel with a great location. The front desk managers are exceptionally helpful and friendly. Hotel was completely full and a little hectic when we were there but that's something out of the hotel's control, and they were managing everything nicely. Overall, great facilities with fantastic entertainment, we recommend 100%! Pool staff are amazing reception staff are terrible and not friendly at all! But over all a lovely relaxing holiday perfect for families I never see in my life in a hotel so problem realy It is terrible hotel very noisy lobby till 00.00, very old look I never will back there. though this hotel is in a good location and big area, but staff are terrible and not friendly (even in some case they were rude). I have many problem to communication with them even reception was not able to speak English. there were no entertaining programs. All restaurant where closed. Finally, I wont recommend this hotel to anyone.
The staff is courteous, efficient and helpful. They are ready to provide services to do with transport and business requests. The buffet breakfast is rather varied and replenished constantly. The outside building is not attractive, but inside there is a feel of little touches and care which make the place friendly and welcoming. Our Comfort Double Room was very spacious indeed and with a modern bathroom. Both the common areas and the bedroom were clean and clearly recently refurbished. The location is a bit remote. However, it is near enough to means of transportation easily linked to the town center. The wi-fi worked beautifully on the first day of our stay, but it was inexplicably not reliable on the following evening. All in all, this hotel provides incredible value for money. Highly recommended, Cheap, clean, cumfy bed and a good shower! All we needed! Surprisingly low level of equipment and facilities. I recognize service to Soviet. Help was nice. It was clean and serviceable. Help was nice. I ordered triple room with 3 single beds but I got room with one double bed and one horrible extra bed so I had to sleep almost on the floor. My back are blocked. There were no shower gel or soap. Room temperature was so low and there were no way to put it higher. Wifi was out of order. Never more. It was the cheapest hotel in Prague at the tim The receptionists were fabulous. The room was pretty spacious but had a stain on the carpet and the elevator was tiny. The breakfast was decent and the staff were very friendly (they even helped us find the apartment we are in right now). It was pretty good overall. (Excellent for what we paid for)
Small and simple room but clean. Reception staff smily and helpful. 10min from train station and right on the edge of the town centre. Great for Christmas markets Decent location and friendly staff. The property is in ok condition. The third floor had the strongest smell of (rotting?) urine that I have EVER encountered. Our room was dorm chic, minimal and well laid out. The (advertised) AC seemed weak, but we were just dropping luggage and going out. Returning around midnight we managed to get into our room without gagging in the urea rich hall. The room was stifling so we called reception. The clerk went over the operation of the thermostat. After 15 minutes we called again and were moved to the 4th floor, which smelled fine (Yay). The AC in the new room didn't work, either. This time when I called the nice clerk he informed me it blows only hot air. I phoned Hotels.com and spoke with Christian. While I waited on hold he called the Ibis Halle and verified that there IS NO AC. I refused a $50 gift certificate. Sleep was imposed with the windows open in a very busy area where construction is everywhere. If you're not sensitive to temperature, noise, or smell this is your place. Great location and walkable to all things Strasbourg.
Basically a nice hotel with easy access to airport. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Warm cookies given at check in. Nice Outback restaurant right in front of hotel. Fire alarm went off around 2:15 am. It was not very loud and most in my party did not hear it. No one was forced to evacuate. Fire department came and turned off alarm. Everyone stood around hallways and in lobby. It must have been a somewhat regular occurrence because overall response was not of concern. The Hotel is very comfortable and I have stayed there several times. This time however I was very disappointed at how loud the Bar Television was, as it echoed all the way to my room on the 5th floor. This was the first time I experienced them having it up so loud and hardly anyone around to even watch it. We've stayed here a few times and are pleased with this accomodation. It's close to SeaTac airport but far away enough so you don't hear the planes landing and taking off. It is also located close to a large selection of shopping centers and restaurants. Checked in late after arriving from Sea-Tac airport. Easy access, room was large and very clean, staff was very nice as well. Have a lot of restaurants near the hotel and friendly staff, when I check in and I ask for check out late , they were give me a offer to check out about 12 pm, I ask may be on 1 pm, they were argree . Hotel location is nice, staffs are friendly, room is quiet, cleand and wide. Even the standard Queen double room, sofa and desk space is in the separate room from bed space. I would like to stay this hotel next time again. Hotel was right next to a great mall in a nice location. The beds were comfortable. The room was clean and large. There weren't very many tv channels but it wasn't really a big issue. Over all I would definitely stay there again. - but the best was the EXCELLENT service, from check-in to a special request to room service. Can't say enough good things about this place! ! Excellent location, lots of restaurants nearby. Easy check in and check out. Very loud elevators broke had to cram in to meany people wai We long time hot tub was out of service bath tub was slimmy Clean spacious rooms comfortable beds. Close to multiple activities. Will be saying there again next time we have to stay in the Seattle area. Hotel overall was good. Big rooms. Though only one elevator was working during our stay so checkout was so busy. Waited 15mins to get down. Could be better If parking was free. There were 5 of us and the room had plenty of room for all of us. Walking to restaurants and shopping. Free shuttle to and from the airport. It was our first time checking in to this hotel and the staff in the counter (Gina) was awesome, she got excellent interpersonal skills, very welcoming. The only downside to the stay was the elevators- there was only 1 functioning elevator servicing the whole building, we have to wait for at least 20 minutes. The rooms were nice and large, staff were friendly. 1st nite found the sink leaked- called in for repair and was fixed. the one bedding had a worn hole in the side of mattress cover. The beds were comfy and soft although our windows were right next to the hvac system ducting, the rain couldn’t completely drown out their noise/ vibration. Upon check out was informed  of the parking fee which was surprising. I found this hotel on google maps, book it based on the location and price. Overall we enjoyed our short stay and I would recommend to anyone. The check in and check out was effortless I was offered a warm cookie, bottled water, access to parking and free wifi when I signed up for the h honours program. The king room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Our kids loved the pool and the room was excellent for the money. We are from South Eastern Washington and drove up to visit family, and we selected this Double Tree because it looked nice. Pictures didn’t do it justice. The facility is great and the staff is friendly. We’ll be back. The only issue i had was i couldnt pay my 150 incedential payment with cash. It had to be on a card. This is the hotel my family always stays at when we have early flights from the airport. You are only 5-10 minutes away from the airport and right across the street from the largest mall in the state. Everything is a bit worn, from the towels to the pool area but it is usually the best deal and my kids don’t mind. The rooms are large and clean, the restaraunt is great, most of th staff are pretty friendly (the restaraunt/room service/lounge staff are absolutely amazing!!!!) and my kids love the pool. The hot tub was not working during the most stay which is a bummer but understandable. The hotel was great. Very clean. The rooms where very spacious and comfortable. My family  loved the room. The front desk was very polite and helpful. They made the check in and out very quick. I was a little upset that they charged for parking. I was aware of a security deposit that they needed to hold, but paying a parking fee I didn't read anywhere in the confirmation email I received when I reserved the rooms. That's the only thing that was very disappointing. Excellent hotel and location. Great bartender. Dinged it one for charging me $18 to park my car at the hotel, and $18 PP for breakfast so add $36+ to the room rate when you are comparing. Location is great 10 min from airport. Shuttle svc was great! Next to mall w/ many food choices, shopping. Room was pretty old and rundown, could use a serious renovation It was a really nuce hotel for a good price. It was clean. The beds were comfortable tv was good. Quit hotel overall had a goos stay. I highly recommend it and will definitely  be staying there again!! ! Very nice, clean hotel. It has very nice rooms with a separate sitting area and two TV's! It also has a free airport. I didn't like having to pay the parking fee just to park my car! Since I stayed there for three nights that added around $50.00 to my bill! Next time I will look for a hotel with free parking! Nice and clean. We had a relax and peace of mind vacation, location is safe, front desk are kind and professionals helping the guests, rooms are well clean. Charged 15 $ for parking  not goog The driver Soyo was very welcoming. I like the proximity to Target. We stayed, for the first time, in a Doubletree in Scotland, near the airport and were really delighted. It was a clean, modern hotel and there was a complimentary drink (beer and wine) in the room for my husband and I, and fresh baked cookies for the kids when we checked in. Wow, we thought! Our second stay at a Doubletree hotel was not quite the same experience. To cut it short, we basically waited 45 minutes for a shuttle for a hotel that was 5 minutes away. The driver had left when we had called but apparently went off to smoke pot as no amount of air freshener could disguise that smell when we stepped into the van. The driver was also acting strange and had her friend along for the ride (apparently she was the night auditor... Um, sure...). The hotel itself was nothing special. We usually book the Sleep Inn, which is excellent. The staff are friendly, reliable and helpful, the rooms clean, and it is half the cost of the Doubletree Suites. We will definitely avoid this hotel in the future. I asked for room service food ,,they said no,,, No friendly people Our stay was great. The staff was amazing!! The room was clean and the warm cookies hit the stop for a traveling children. Perfect for our needs. The best thing was that all of our favorite stores were next door! All easy walking distance. Lots of space in our room. The manager was particularly thoughtful! Thanks to the whole staff for the wonderful stay. My stay was a great one. Shuttle from and to airport very convenient. Nice clean room. Will stay again. We liked it had a fun time the only down side there was a convention going on and lobby was so full u could not get around. We would say excuse me but they would not move. Over all it was good Had a late check-in from airport....would have been a perfect 5 star...if they had vending machine with some food .. Love the double queen room. Only down fall was that you can hear yout neighbors clearly. Rooms without the connecting doors would be awesome. Would stay here again but without hearing neighbor noise would be great! Enjoyed my stay at DoubleTree Suites while in Seattle Clean and nice for the price I paid. very convinient next to hotel great convention and meeting space offered. shuttle to airport available too love it! awesome value for the price paid. Will book again No free wi-fi like in the rest of the world. The rest was great. The room was spacious and clean. Close to the mall so we were able to by a coulple of sim cards and by internet data. Very close to the airport via free shuttle, major shopping center, and entertainment. Quiet, comfortable, and clean. Certainly a place for businessman and families both. Wish had bigger trash cans, beds were very comfy. Enjoyed the free baked cookies. Spider on pillow and room smelled unclean............,... First time we were ever in Seattle we were very glad that the hotel had a shuttle going to and from the airport that made a world of difference. It was really very good place, I would recommend you to add  soccer program in the tv Chanel’s such as Silver... thanks... Sincerely, muhyadin Maybe it’s a Seattle thing but 14 bucks a day for parking??? Is there really a shortage of parking spots?
Room was small, no room to open 2 luggages. Staff were unclear on parking area, just threw us a map. Good value for hotel near park and a place to sleep. Not worth staying for extended period Very friendly & helpful staff. Free carpark. nice stay. like tgeir high speed wifi and really smell less non-smoking room
Just stayed overnight as travelling along gaspe coast. Very comfortable. Very nice and modern hotel. Good restaurant 'Le Cargo' . good STAY AND RESERVATION WAS EXACT. oNE NIGHT STOP TOWARDS GASPESIE. GAVE US A ROOM EAR;IER THAN MINIMUM TIME. Very Nice viiew on the Beach. Nice chairs. Faire on the beach. Good restorants. Pool and massage . Very clean. We had booked for one night  an decided to change room and move to the water side, Overall very satisfied but for an unknown reason I have been very sick after choosing and eating the most expensive item on the menu: The Captain Plate. Delicious but unhappy ending. Very friendly staff! Lovely walk on the beach in the morning and then breakfast with a view! alarm system went on at midnight for 2o minutes and the telephone rang 15 minutes after the alarm stop to tell us it was a false alarm. How can you sleep. Road construction made getting to hotel tricky but it was worth it We've always had a wonderful stay at Hotel Riotel Matane! Great room design with good tech hook-ups and a sleek feeling. Great pool. Beautiful area. This was an amazing hotel. The manager and staff were friendly and the service was outstanding. They have a restaurant called; Cargo. The service, food and ambiance was A1. Highly recommended and I will be back . This time with the family Excellent hotel and accommodations. A1 The hotel was great! The only thing lacking was that the alarm rang early in the morning ( not us who set it). Also, there was no hand soap. As my family owns a motel, I realize it is the cleaning staff who forgot these things and just had me worried about the overall cleanliness and their efficiency. However, the motel was beautiful, my son loved the pool, and the reception staff were wonderful. We did have a great time!
We got sky floor. The room quite specious and very nice view. Check in took a bit longer time. Other than that overall very satisfied It was a gentle introduction to Japan before moving on to Kyoto. The luggage transfer service was very welcome. Too hot during dinner, they need more aircon for the private room. We were charged two times for breakfast by mistake as they could not communicated well with us in English. An excellent hotel, with really helpful staff. We had to alter our travel arrangements at very short notice due to an earthquake in Nagasaki. The staff at Otsu Prince Hotel were very understanding and helpful and managed to arrange accommodation a day earlier than our original booking. We were a party of six, so we really appreciated their efforts. The hotel rooms were very roomy, clean and comfortable. Access is easy and there are plenty of shops and restaurants close by. The hotel is situated on Lake Biwa and the views from the rooms are beautiful. The view from the 38th floor is spectacular. Well positioned for sightseeing tourists. The counter staff could speak very good English and were well presented and polite. Apon entering our room we were swept away by the massive size of the room, and the fantastic view out across the lake! Still relatively close to Kyoto, I wish we had spent more time at Otsu Prince in such comfort whilst we explored Otsu and Kyoto. The hotel is currently under renovation. Did not hear any noise or see any construction. I did, however see a thick layer of dust on the floors, indicating that a vacuum cleaner had not been used in some time. Aside from that, the room was relatively clean. The futon couches that double as additional beds in the rooms were the most uncomfortable thing I've ever slept on in my life, although after a long day of sightseeing, it was a place to rest. The room was cleaned and fresh towels delivered while we were out for the day, which was a nice surprise. The staff were friendly and helpful. It was neither the best, nor the worst place I've ever stayed. As an exhausted tourist, it definitely serves its purpose. Stayed for two nights visiting mainly Kyoto area. there is a shuttle bus to and from Otsu station every 30 minutes. Public transportation is excellent. Takes 25min from hotel gates to Kyoto station. Room is much bigger and comfort then in Kyoto center. The staff doesn't speak English, but the tried hard.
Have been to Paris for work and holidays before and wasn't really a big fan until this trip and this hotel made the difference. Situated in the perfect area close to everything you want and need from sights to great places to wine and dine. To top it all off the hotel is such a beautiful hotel and oddly enough the hotel's pictures are actually how the rooms really look! The staff were super friendly, helpful and amazing and they really made us all feel very welcome and cared for. Thanks ladies and gents for taking such good care of us. This was my first trip to Paris, so I had high hopes. I would like to say most of the hotel staff was helpful. There were 2 that were not. One was when I checked in, he was a bit rude. I had an issue where the key would get stuck in the door and the lock would not work. From the inside it was fine, but the key would stick on the outside. This was the 2nd day and I let them know. I was told maintenance would address. The next day I got toe deal with the 2nd unpleasant person. I asked about the lock being fixed (as I could not lock my door to leave). He said it would take 2 days to fix. I explained I was leaving the following day and asked what to do about my luggage. He told me to pack it up and bring it downstairs and they would put it in a room till I got back? A young man accompanied me up and I told him I didn't think that was right? I should get a new room if nothing else? This was quite inconvenient. When I got back, they had moved my stuff to a upgraded room. This was nice, but not sure it was worth the effort since I left the following morning. The staff was friendly and the location was near several metro stops. The front desk attendants tried to be helpful with directions and such but most of the time they needed to look things up on the internet. Rooms are small European standard. The furniture and decor are several decades outdated. The lighting in the rooms is very poor. The bathroom needs much work as the glass shower guard is too small and does not prevent water from splashing all over the place leaving a soaking wet floor afterwards. Additionally the only outlet in the bathroom connected to the hairdryer and marked use for shavers only. This outlet did not work with my curling iron or my flat iron and there was no other place in the room with a plug or mirror where I could fix my hair. The cleaning staff threw away out toothbrush covers and razor covers- so if you would like to ensure that you have all your toiletries in tact then I would suggest that they are stored away before the rooms are made up. My daughter and I only had 5 days this time for her birthday but it was lovely. Super quiet and calm. All the desk staff were very helpful and polite. Halls smelled lemony and clean; cleaning staff was quiet in the mornings and respected the privacy signs. (We had horrible jet lag!!) Have been to Paris multiple times every year since 1981; first time in this hotel and would definitely return. A bit far from the main tourist sites, but worth it for the restfulness for me. (I'm old now!!) The metro stop Chemin Vert is short walk down Beaumarchais (main street)  Maybe because the hotel was so calm and relaxing, the metro this time seemed dirty, extra smelly, and unsupervised. No one was checking tickets and people openly jumped the turnstiles even with employees present. No police, soldiers, dogs, or any signs of surveillance presence that were obvious in the past. We still used it but there was a change or maybe a cut in funding. Still has way more coverage of the city than Chicago does, as far as getting around! And beats walking in the freezing rain. Hotel proved perfect for me, travelling on my own. Staff were consistently helpful and charming. Breakfast in my room was good quality and a real treat. Hotel retained character without being devoid of  modern amenities. Would suggest making use of the opportunity to have hotel arrange taxi to and from airport, which made life a lot easier. Very nice front area, bar  and breakfast room. The room  and bathroom excellent. Front desk very helpful. Villa Beaumarchais is a cute and friendly villa in the Marais. The friendly staff were always helpful. The comfortable lobby and sun room were nice to come home to each night. Staff were very good including room cleaners who went well beyond minimum. Charming rooms, comfy bed, bathroom very clean. Plenty of character. Good little coffee shop around corner on Boulevard Beaumarchais for exclt coffee and brekkie. Laundry rates bit over the top. Great location close to metro stop. Reasonably priced. We’ve stayed a few times and have always found the staff to be really helpful. Really comfortable bed. Plus larger bathroom than other Paris hotels we’ve stayed in. We received a very warm and friendly welcome. Room was spacious and very clean. Enormous bed with wonderful pillows. Room was a little chilly when we arrived but a portable heater had been provided and that proved to be sufficient. Overlooked the  inner courtyard, so very quiet. Well located, especially for the Opera Bastille. Just a 5 minute walk from the Bastille, this hotel is reasonably priced and the staff was very knowledgeable about local restaurants. When my son and I became ill due to food poisoning (from a place not associated with the hotel), they were extremely helpful in bringing us Sprite and other items to help us be more comfortable. The rooms are a bit small, but clean and comfortable. It was well-located in a vibrant, safe neighborhood. Lovely hotel in a great area of Paris with lots of stores and restaurants. The staff was very helpful when we planned a spontaneous trip to Reimes. Highly recommend. This hotel is warmly comfortable, friendly, international and tucked out of the way in a quiet corner of the 3rd Arrondissement just steps away from the Place des Voges, the Oberkampf quartier and Bastille. Extraordinarily helpful staff, multilingual and multinational. The interior vibe is fin-de-siecle Hemingway, with liberal use of red velvet, leather couches and a lovely skylight breakfast room with potted palms. Bring your writing notebook, sit in the lobby and pretend you're writing a novel. We were there for a family vacation, and it makes a very soft landing pad for arrival in Paris after a red eye from North America. Fun local restaurants nearby, including Bistrot Populaire, a block away. Definitely NOT a neighborhood for splashy wealth, snobby waiters correcting your French or attitude, just regular Parisians enjoying the cool of the Marais and the nearby 11th Arrondissement: boulangeries owned by North African baker families, Italian restaurants where they speak Italian, French and English, in that order. Be a regular Parisian and get away from the tourist mob. Worked very well for a family from 7 to 70. Almost everyone was pleasant with the exception of one person who was in charge of the breakfast buffet. Front desk crew was incredibly helpful. Very good value. Would stay there there again.comfort Great location. Nice staff.5 stars stay This was our second stay at the hotel. Will return Great location just off the main road close to the metro, yet tucked away so fairly quiet. Beds were very comfortable and breakfast was plentiful with a good variety of foods on offer. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and our wardrobe door was a bit rickety and hard to close, but they’re only minor things and wouldn’t put us off returning. Great place. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Great location. Nice breakfast. The best thing about our stay was the breakfast. It was a fusion of American and European style breakfasts: eggs, hash browns and bacon along with croissants and pastries. I thought our breakfast was complimentary. When we checked in, the front desk told us breakfast hours but didn't tell us there was a fee. So it was a shock when we checked out that we were charged an extra 90 euros. They did waive the last day but still they should have been clear from the beginning. The other complaint is that our room was off to the side on a floor with only 4 other rooms. The hall lights were controlled by motion sensors that were constantly off even during the day. The carpet was old and frayed. It felt like we were in the servants quarters because the rest of the hotel was nicer and did not have these motion controlled lights in the hall. The staff was friendly and helpful but the area itself was not as bustling with energy like Montparnasse and shuts down after 9pm. With the exception of the breakfast, I probably wouldn't stay here again. The hotel was in a good location and was within walking distance of a couple of Metro stops. It made getting around Paris very easy. The staff was very friendly and helpful and had good recommendations for good restaurants in the neighborhood. The breakfast was excellent. Would definitely stay here again! Right in the heart of the Marais and tucked away in a quiet corner, this little gem of a hotel met all our expectations - lovely bright breakfast area, good food, clean and quiet room, comfy bed. Staff friendly and helpful. Ideal for our valentine's escape!
Stayed here last year it was good However not so good this year not up to last years standards very dissatisfied balconys and outside dining areas updated  they should have started inside the rooms first Great hotel, great staff but far from the beach, restaurants, the city ect. You must come and have a car as it would be not ok otherwise Varying levels of English from staff but manageable - great to practice my Spanish. Bed was too hard for my partner. Amor in the restaurant pontet was amazing -  very friendly and helpful. staff were friendly, rooms were clean and comfortable and the facilities in the area were nice. Overall a great place to stay and would go back again The one bedroom suite was  very nice and the views were worth the extra money. It was February so a bit cold, but we still sat on the deck overlooking the water and got a little sun. The only drawback was that it was cold when sun went down and we could not get heat to work, so we just st layered up. I doubt this would be a problem very often. Check in receptionist spoke excellent English. Excellent food and very helpful staff. Beautiful setting which feels like a traditional Spanish village. Would happily return So nice to walk out onto balcony to a lovely sea view. Very tranquil and laid back, nice pool - very cold but clean and not crowded. Accomodation a nice standard and spacious. The restaurants there aren't that great and a bit overpriced - better to head into El Campello where there's loads of choice and better quality. Mini golf nice for the kids. The view from the room was amazing! But it was older and definitely could use some new paint and a good cleaning.Air conditioning is poor and rooms got extremely warm! The cockroach was a not so nice roommate for our son. Maids only clean rooms every third day so making beds and basic stuff you do, not much of a vacation for Mom. Amazing property with stunning sea views lovely views but very quiet and steep climb up hill to apartments ,need some entertainment on in the evenings as no where to go unless drive or taxi
Excellent service since the check in, very please with the agents. No breakfast free but the personal served some juice, breads and cookies for us ! We were 14 in this trip with 8 teenagers and 6 adults. Great location , very convenient and we stayed at dowtown for a couple of days before Iguazu (intentionally) and couple of days after Iguazu!! So enjoy and have fun Hotel Ibis,great locgratation,walk to restaurants,shopping,staff very friendly and helpful,good location to see local historic buildings and churchs.Glynn United States. Reservations were cancelled! And of course nobody knew who did it! The hotel is well located and its staff is very kind. Very good choice. Everything perfect. I'll be back mani times.
Good hotel, it's just a bit far away from everywhere. Good if you like golf, gym is good, pool a bit cold, sauna and steam room excellent. Service was spot on, from reception, through the wedding reception and into breakfast the next day. Stayed here on business and had informal meeting in the bar over coffee then ate later in the bar myself, leaving early the next morning. The general surroundings, inside and out, were pleasant and well maintained. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My meal in the bar was OK - pleasant home cooking and a big portion rather than restaurant presentation. The choice seemed rather limited though I suppose the restaurant is there if one wants a wider and fancier choice. One or two minor gripes but I would stay there again when next in the area. From start to finish, my wife & I felt so relaxed. We arrived after a long day shopping and couldn't wait to just put our feet up for a weekend. We arrived into our room and that moment of awe wow. The room was terrific and so comfortable. Hilton pillows are really light & thin, however the bed comfort was simply amazing. We went down to the bar where my wife ordered a Pinacolada, she was disappointed by the mix and so we asked for a new one. The serving manager personally apologised and made a new one for us by himself. He was so attentive. It was that golden customer experienced that shaped the rest of our stay. The pool/gym facilities are a bit old and not the best kept (or updated). However we enjoyed turning up for a session, and no real complaints there. Breakfast was great and we left the hotel smiling & wishing we had stayed another night. Not pleasant, and didn't get a good night's sleep. We arrived on a muggy day, and the heat in the room was oppressive. We soon found there was no air conditioning, so we made due with open windows (no big screens) and a small circular fan from the closet. Would have slept better, but the bed was quite hard. Oh, and don't bother with the restaurant for dinner -- after a 45 minute wait for our food, our £12 burgers were cooked dry as a bone. We had a short but great stay. Only 10 minutes to the Belfast International Airport. Very impressed with the staff, who were so helpful and quick to meet our requests. The golf course environment was very pleasant. Good lift service to upper floors. Very helpful staff. Good parking Handy to motorway and very quiet. Very comfortable. Was one of our most expensive rooms on our trip to Ireland and was not the best by any means. Golf courses looked beautiful and the hotel grounds were nice but you definitely don't get the bang for your buck when it comes to hotel room or hotel staff speed doing anything. I would only recommend staying here if you're playing golf at the hotel. I booked this for a spa trip but was totally not the right place. The spa is a swimming pool with doors off it to sauna/ steam room. The pool was full of children (which is who I had booked spa trip to get away from)! This is a nice hotel outside Belfast in a quiet place. Staff are all great and welcoming. Rooms are OK, could be a bit cleaner though. The hotel needs renovation but the overall facilities are really good and give good value to the hotel. Only problem children under 16 couldn't use pool after 7pm ? Room: overall comfortable and generally a reasonable standard. Small niggle is the tiny cups on hospitality tray. Bathroom: a bit tired overall. Water pressure was weak but compensation was the nice standard of toiletries available  Staff: very pleasant and interactive  Food: restaurant food was excellent and well presented. Negatives: price of wifi. I would have thought this is a standard service now requiring no need to charge extra for. Was a nice hotel. Swimming pool nice also kids friendly. Food was good. Rooms were too warm so none of us slept much even with windows open. Though there was a bar, lounging area was not enough. It was taking up by a large group that stayed so no space for others. Decor is a little dated getting. Overall a pleasant stay. Good hotel great location for Belfast and the Causeway. Stayed there and did 3 days in Belfast and drove the Causeway coastal route Very pleasant staff, good food, very clean comfy rooms. Good selection at the bar. Excellent. Staff were very helpful and pleasant, room very clean and tidy food very good all in all a very pleasant stay. Fab family room.... great size ! Staff great  hotel a little dated but super time . Had a great few nights at this friendly hotel. The staff were great. Lovely food, good cocktails and great room service. The spa is good and the pool was very pleasing. If I still played golf this hotel would be perfect for all activities  I didn’t use the gym but it was well equipped and popular by the look of it. Really nice clean hotel. With helpful and caring staff. The bedrooms are clean and comfortable. And very spacious. Very good facilities. The breakfast is very tasty. The breakfast was superb especially the hot buffet section. Our room was big including the ensuite. Hotel has swimming pool, gym, golf course &tennis courts. We booked a family room and were attending an early morning athletics event at nearby Antrim the following morning. I asked at reception if we could keep the room for an extra couple of hours and this was sorted out no problem. We had a family room deluxe booked and it was very spacious. Some of the furniture was a bit tatty and the bathroom had seen better days . The beds and room were clean but the pillows were very soft and two were needed to get proper support. The noise from our bathroom plumbing and nearby rooms was a bit excessive and only settled down after midnight. The service and food in the restaurant was first class and deserves a special mention . Kids eat free at a buffet and the the main meals for adults was very good and nothing was a problem. Very impressed by this aspect. The rooms could do with a spruce up but this wouldn’t stop us staying again. I arrived late in the evening. I was very keen to sleep. The sleep quality was awful, I ended up with two single beds and they were very lightweight and bouncy. When I finally got to sleep, I was awoken by a fire alarm at about 4.30am. There was no fire and it stopped ringing after about 5  minutes (by which time I was dressed). I didn't get any more sleep after that. There was no explanation or apology from the hotel. You have to join the Hilton Honours scheme to be able to get wifi in the room. I had a skype meeting in the morning so needed that facility. The breakfast was only lukewarm. I don't think I will stay again. Great night away, beautiful setting and very comfortable hotel. All staff were very pleasant and willing to help. Rooms have everything you need, bathroom could probably do with a refurb, although is perfectly acceptable. Food was excellent and if you get a chance, Antrim Castle and Gardens are definitely worth a visit as recommended by the receptionist on check out. It’s a 10 minute drive away but we’ll worth a visit! Great family friendly hotel..kids were very accommodated with both a breakfast and dinner buffet...they loved it! Great hotel, clean, everything works well. Nice TV. Comfortable bed. Didn't try the food as I was only there for the one night arriving late & leaving early. Very nice hotel with very good breakfast Very helpful and efficient staff A very good stay at the Hilton. Sharon on reception was brilliant. Food was really good in the restaurant Amazing place Hotel was easy to find. Lovely setting overlooking golf course. Breakfast was delicious. Very dog friendly. Staff where extremely helpful. Arrived after getting off the midnight ferry only to find they had resold my room. Not the best after working and travelling for 19hrs to hear the words ‘nothing we can do as you booked through a third party’ now trying to reclaim money The room was clean and well equipped. Checkin was seamless and the staff were friendly and helpful Very spacious room. The food and service in the restaurant was ok. Good hotel, it's just a bit far away from everywhere. Good if you like golf, gym is good, pool a bit cold, sauna and steam room excellent. Service was spot on, from reception, through the wedding reception and into breakfast the next day. I stayed here on business recently and found it to be a good hotel. I didn't have an opportunity to use most of the facilities (pool, golf etc) but they looked great! Quite a distance from Belfast but very convenient for the International airport. The hotel was bright, airy and clean. Staff  could not do enough for you. Food in both the bar and restaurant were top notch. When you ordered in the bar - children under 10 ate for free. Home made cookies for kids decorating were amazing. Breakfast was a buffet - but the chef's were actually cooking it in front of you and they keep a very fresh supply of all foods. Nutella muffins at breakfast were amazing! Looking forward to return trip. Great views, cleanliness and the most polite staff. Brilliant breakfast spread and camfort beyond compare.
I'd like to leave a neutral review about this hotel. We did not have any problems with it. It was clean, up-to-date, perfectly serviceable. Having travelled in Japan some, I expect small rooms, particularly if a Western bed is part of the furnishings, but this room was very small:  It was barely possible to walk past the foot of the bed to get to the far side of the bed. It was very much a business hotel. No problems, just nothing great.
Was very disappointed with the breakfast. For the cost of the room what was available was extremely limited. My husband and I ended up ordering a simple bacon, eggs, home fries off the menu for just over $5. The eggs were, sorry to say, disgusting. Even the server questioned the ordered food when we mentioned it to him the next day. The room was decent, though there were long black hairs in the bathroom. The towels are like sandpaper. TheTV did not work properly. Old beds. Overall very average room. Great service & close to ikea,  good food friendly service When ever we travel to Toronto we choose the Monti Carlo. We know we are certain to have a wonderful stay. Good hotel and convenient location to activities in the Vaughan area. Continental breakfast is included but hot food is for extra pay. Staff was very friendly. The bar staff working, young man and women were a lot of fun. The staff in the morning for breakfast very attentive. Love this place To my experience really and the hotel i have been comparing to your hotel yours is a great location and clean nice atmosphere u ask me next time I visit Toronto you will be the first one thanks for the great service Very nice & quiet. Good breakfast. Room clean, free smoking, it was a good place for a walk at night and feel save to do it. My wife and I couldn't be happier with our stay at the Monte Carlo. It was perfect. Close to all business in Vaughan, very clean, friendly staff, great breakfast, easy access, good close parking and we would go back anytime we need to go to Vaughan. This hotel is very handy to the 400 and also to the Vaughn Mills Mall and Ikea. Room was very large with a nice fireplace and comfortable bed and pillows! great experience would  definitely go again room was very clean bed was comfortable and there was many amenities close by Everything was fine,nice hotel easy access.Right up until I went to pay the bill for 3 nights.The first night was 140,the second night and third night was 170. They said it was Expedia’s price.nothing they could do. You quoted one price and you pay a different price. Not impressed. It was horrible, the alarm went off at 4 in the morning and everyone had to got to the front when it was finally time to go back to the rooms we asked the front desk if breakfast can run a little later then usual and they said NO! Horrible customer service and for what I paid DEFINITELY not worth it. Above average hotel with clean rooms, central to all highways and attractions Hotel and staff was friendly. Close to Walmart. I was disappointed about the continental breakfast. I expected a little more than a bowl of fruit and bread. Overall okay. There is a breakfast location in walking distance also so that was good. Come here for work trips. Close to highways and restaurants. Great value for what you get. Will stay here again loved having the divided room so we had some space without the tv disturbing the other party. appreciate the microwave and fridge. Breakfast was good not great. The multi charger was a nice idea but didn't charge the phone. Great channel selection and guide. It was a nice affordable, clean hotel. Enjoyed the restaurant, and free parking. woken up by loud people in the room above us at 2am I had a great stay, staff was friendly, and room was clean, remote was not fully working for the TV, and the shower adjustment knob was loose. minor items, that didn't impede my stay or giving a bad review. Stay was good and quiet. I thought the continental breakfast could have a little more variety of things to eat. The hotel was great. Excellent value for the money. Clean and staff very helpful. Highly recommend it. All was great except for breakfast was not much healthy choices Access from the highway was great. Close and convenient. The check in was smooth. Since it was a very late check in and early departure, there was no time to see the rest of the building. The bed was comfortable and the shower was hot   !!! What I did see was clean, and well maintained. The continental breakfast was a combination of order off the menu or cold assortment. All was good. Great housekeeping. Clean hallways. Excellent room. Complimentary breakfast voucher was appreciated. Would stay again! Breakfast should be improved. Good reasonably price Excellent customer service. Friendly, professional and welcoming staff. Exceeded my expectations. This place is our new go-to place to stay in Vaughan! Very comfortable, breakfast is great and it's just a short walk to the new TTC subway station! You can't go wrong with the value and comfort. The stay was very comfortable It was a great experience. Staff was fabulous, friendly. Nice and clean and would recommend this hotel with anyone with any preferences Excellent main entrance for traveling with a disabled person. Attendant was helpful in finding a room on the main floor to help. Rooms were in great shape. Nice shower. Comfortable beds.
Even the old wing of the hotel has been upgraded since my last visit, its a 3.5 star hotel, yet it lacks any personal touch, the rooms are new but all the walls are bare with no pictures, they have doors leading to the next room which means one can hear the neighbours conversations. There is no complimentary drinking water provided . Just a few little touches would make it a lot better. The buffet breakfast is pretty awful, everything cooked was swimming in oil, and the way its set out means food is dotted all over the place and one has to walk from one side of the restaurant to another just to get another dish ! molds & mildew underside of tub mat, tub, and shower curtain, plus cockroaches, cockroaches & cockroaches everywhere! very good service and comfortable hotel, food  experience was amazing. thanks to all staff. cockroach and smelly Hotel staff very accommodating and always smiling... My wife and I had an excellent experience at the Garden Orchid Hotel. this is a nice hotel with large clean pool. Breakfast was good too. Good restaurant is just next door. Room service food is fine as well. Walking distance to the airport. We are coming back again. The hotel was not really set up for expats more for locals and Chinese. The staff were very friendly and went out of there way to please you but had little real experience with expats. The facilities except that there was no internet in the room. Internet was found in the main lobby and was not the best. The hotel section that we were in was a little tired and needed some TLC but the new wing is a lot better but did not sleep there and cannot give feed back. But overall a pleasant stay Right from the beginning it was a disappointment. My immediate impression when I walked in the doors was that this was a grand hotel. But that soon withered. When I asked for the WiFi password I was informed that there is no WiFi in the rooms. Only the lobby. Meaning I had to be dressed and in the lobby, not my room, to get in line. To me, when a hotel advertises free internet, it means at my leisure in my room. And to sit on the sofas and chairs in this lobby was not something I wanted to do. They were caked with head grease and grime. Green chairs with black shinny heir grease head rests. The food, especially the buffet, was terrible. And even though I could find something I would like to eat, it was still not the best. Service was terrible when ordering from the tattered and torn menues. The pool was very nice, in the sun and refreshing. But the poolside bathrooms were disgusting. Filthy. Not somewhere I would call a COMFORT station. Room care was worse. No ice, no refrigerator. When they cleaned they did not clean. Trash was always left in the room. Old packets of shampoo remained in my room for 6 nights. Just stupid disregard for simple cleanliness. Instead of complimentary water each day, they sometimes remembered to refill an existing bottle in the room. I am very weary of the water I drink and I did not like that. Finally, the pillows were awful. Just one solid piece of cheap foam.The comforter was not. It was a sheet, a cheap thin felt blanket and another sheet No air conditioning any where in hotel     Room AC was pre set at 75 degrees It was the best hotel I've stayed in Zamboanga City, so far. Having said that, there are a lot of room for improvement. friendly staff. room I stayed in had excellent views The best hotel in the city proper .. close to the airport Was a wonderful holiday for my fiance! Friendly stall great room... They gave guests a voucher for special midnight buffet on new years! Will be back. Thank you Garden Orchid! Really enjoyed this hotel! The staff was perfect! Definitely will be back! Overall, it was an ok place to stay, providing a safe place to eat, sleep, and nice pool use. The nearby city is supposedly not safe for foreigners, especially Americans. However, I had no problems, as I never traveled around alone. I felt having locals with me everywhere I went kept me safe. If you are with locals who know each other, you're in good hands. If you don't know anybody, you're in the wrong place. The hotel and airport have armed security who are very friendly towards Americans. There are also security guards and police around the general area. Always friendly. The entire hotel staff was very friendly as well. The hotel is large and structured like a castle that protects the inner courtyard and pool from the outside street pollution and dubious indigenous peoples. Foreigners beware in Zamboanga. Also, only eat well-cooked foods and take probiotics to help avoid gastroenteritis, like I got. People don't wash their hands much here. Staff not attentive. One staff was rude. Room was not clean . Needs are not acted upon in a timely manner. I have to call front office several times to get their attention & act on my request.
Convenient place in Berlin to shopping center  To the zoo and to main train station,  To visit the best places in the city Helpful staff  I will recommend this hotel Nice hotel....lots to do....close to train station and bus stops Very nice, modern and useful   what I did not like: they say that you can not use any of your HHonors benefits when you make the booking not directly from the hotel or their system. Pros: Nice comfortable room, good location   Cons: Concierge knowledge not so great, slow service, staff aren’t very helpful quite easily the best service and most exceptional staff we've experienced in any hotel in Europe! Great hotel, superb location and excellent value for money. Just one word: Excellent .....There is not another word that can describe the experience of being at the Waldorf Astoria. The hotel enjoys a perfect location for the markets, shopping and the zoo. Great staff, great breakfast. Comfortable beds. If I had to find a negative it would be that the bath water was too cool. It seemed set a one temperature which wasn't hot. By the time you filled the bath it was too cold to lie in. But the shower was hot and powerful. Overall enjoyed it. Last year I stayed at the Ritz Carlton. I shall stay there if I return in the future. From A to Z perfect The hotel is good but I surprised when I went to spa they informed to pay 15€ if I want to use it, this is my first time during my staying on differentt places. A wonderful hotel, pleasant helpful staff. The room was great and clean with all the amenities you would desire. Very helpful with lost luggage. Kept working with airlines. Upgraded our room. Overall vet satisfied Nice accommodations. Great location! The breakfast buffet was incredible! It was a perfect experience the attention to detail is like a well engineered German car.
The check-in was a bit weird because it is in the loby of an other Hotel. It is not a problem but it would have been better if I knew before getting there.. The location is perfect! 2 min walk from the beach. The pool is very cool, we had a lot of fun. The bathrooms to me would need a little more privacy. Very difficult to sleep during weekends but the rest of the week was good! I would totally recommend this hostel. Amazing place to meet people and to have fun if you are traveling alone! I didn't really appreciate that they asked us to leave the kitchen because some people were complaining about the noise.. it is a HOSTEL. So, if you are not willing to deal with noise and people you should seek for a Hotel instead! :) There are no doors between the main area, the dorm and the bathrooms/shower areas, making it noisy at all times. The shower doors don't lock, you don't have any space or hangers to leave your towel and clothes inside your shower stall and they are quite dirty - hairs everywhere on the floor, sand, which made me wear my flip flop at all times when around the shower area. Without any doors, you hear the staff very loudly when prepping the breakfast area (at 7:30am!) and then they start cleaning in around your bed at 9am, again, making noise, talking loud. The pool area was also very dirty - I never saw any staff cleaning up there in all 4 days I was there. The water of the pool is green, no one also cleaning it in the 4 days I was there. Insects in the kitchen drawers. They give you a lock and key for a drawer under the beds - the locks and keys are all the same and my key actually opened the lock on the drawer next to mine as well - my bet is the locks and keys are all the same. One last thing: there are no individual light for your bed (unless you ask, and probably pay extra for) for your bed, and there are also no individual electrical outlets for each bed, which means your phone and/or computer most likely will end up plugged-in pretty far from your bed. I have stayed in multiple hostels in my life, so I have plenty to compare this one with and it was definitely not worth the 100US$+/night. The only thing it has for itself: the other tenants and location. This was my first time staying in a hostel and I didn't know what to expect. I regularly stay at hotels but wanted a new experience. Check in was easy. I was escorted to the rooms. Only people staying there can enter the building. There's a a large kitchen and living area with a washer and dryer. The beds were comfortable and you were provided with locks for your safe which is not provided at the Loft Hostel down the street so I felt happy that my things were secured. The bathroom and showers were relatively clean and there is a lot of space. It was chilled and the place mosty stayed clean and the people was nice and the pool area had a beautiful scene a nice view at times Was so cool. So clean. Quiet. Great stay sign posh. Awesome pool and bar. Met some great people. Would stay again for sure. The cleaners are very noisy. They talk on their phones constantly and make no effort to try to be quiet. They insisted the lights to be kept on until midnight when everyone was trying to sleep. The showers and toilets did not get properly cleaned during my stay (4 nights). Otherwise the place serves its purpose. Good location and good facilities. Friendly environment, clean, well located I didn't stay because i wasn't a guest I was unaware it's just for quest not local so I didn't get a refund. Hotel charges two nights without you staying there. Shuttle never arrived, customer service extremely rude and didn’t care about their mistake. I needed a night stay due to mixing up flights. This Hostel was great and is a part of a family of hotels inns motels and hotels; within walking miles of each other. The location is blocks to and on the south beach miami area. Updated accommodations. Free wifi. The photos look like the actual place. Has a huge locking metal drawer for your valuables. About the size of large suitcase. They provide sheets, towel, tissue, pillow, soap, shampoo, and blanket. Just as hotels would and i dont recall anything else. Spacious enough to not feel overcrowded in a dorm environment. I also used my expedia points. My only issue which really comes with the territory is there is no door or anything to block out the noise coming from upstairs from ppl who are still up. I will book again next. I overheard the front desk say you can rent out an entire floor for a group. They also have a shuttle. Expedia needs to know what you are selling. When I called and asked about co ed dorm, I was told it's female only; I couldn't believe it but I was reassured by the agent. She said she talked to the hotel. //The hostel itself is not bad, great location. It's too noisy at night though. In addition to what you expect, people get up and sleep differently, there's a strange noise of washing machine running non-stop into midnight. Worst part is, no shower have door locks shared by male/female, some only curtain. I wonder how much it costs to put a lock to the door. And had problem locating the hostel, it's on google map but no road sign at all. U have to walk into whitelaw hotels front desk and ask, they share the front desk. This is an especially great choice if you're traveling alone. Awesome facility. Friendly staff! The only drawbacks: no sound reduction coming from shared toilets (little privacy there), nowhere to really plug in devices to charge up overnight by your bed, and noise from upstairs gets quite loud. Highly recommend earplugs. Apart from that, it's stellar! Lovely rooftop pool (even in February)! Two minutes to GORGEOUS beach. So many restaurants and clubs in the area (free entry to Mango's across the street was included) and we saw three celebrities there the first night. I never felt unsafe at any point. Free airport shuttle! Close to the free trolley! Such a deal. I'll go back. This was a great stay. I was a bit weary about sharing a room with that many people in a co-ed setting but the patrons were on the whole quiet and respectful of each other. Even though the beds were close to each other, they have boards on one side and the way they are laid out means that no one is facing you while you sleep. This was important to me, especially as most of the hotel patrons were men, very few of us women travelling alone. Ask for a lower level bunk if you can! Staff at reception (at the Whitelaw hotel next door) was amazing - gracias Duvay and Lee!! The cleaning staff are constantly coming by during the day, which means the place is super clean AND they made me feel safe, as I feel like they are keeping an eye on things. There is a drawer under the bed with a lock, and my carry on suitcase fit inside. My stuff was secured at all times. You can have some privacy in your bed or by the roof top pool, and if you want to socialize with folks you can easily do that in the common room. Also the airport shuttle was fantastic, look for South Beach Group bus. Call to ask the hostel for details on where it leaves. I picked it up at the Miami International Airport, Terminal G, Exit Door #17 This was my first time staying at a Hostel. I'm a little older than the the usual age group that stays at a hostel, so I was a little apprehensive about making this booking. I'm happy I did. I had an amazing stay. check in was easy and really good. The sleeping area is a huge room with a lot of beds. Everyone pretty much kept to themselves and was pretty respect of noise. I had no problem with using the bathroom. The hostel was clean and new/updated. There's a lot of amenities i.e airport shuttle, breakfast, beach towels. It's 2 blocks from the beach and there's a pool. Perfect place if you are on a budget and want a quick getaway to Miami without the crazy expense. All age is welcome, which is fantastic I would not recommend staying here. The place is a mess and not clean at all. Bedbugs, blood in the bath rooms, and smelly throughout the entire place. I actually got sick of just staying in this place. The Only good thing about this place is the location. Was expecting to be in a room of 8 max but instead there's about 15 beds and it's all co Ed. The Common areas are nice and clean and it's a good location. It was a nice stay, my first experience T a hostel a nice one The staff beds and location are great- but you’re in one of three very open rooms share with lots of people so good luck sleeping First time I stayed at a hostel would definitely do it again! I would like my money returned to me I never checked in they said they had parking also when I arrived they were book even when I had a reservation. Also they never said I had to pay a 50.00$ deposit. Never stayed in a hostel before? I decided to stay down at South Beach as I had a few drinks and opted for a cheap option. Posh was nice but people snoring and farting is really not my thing,  even though I'm a snorer. A very good facility all the same. But don't count on getting loads of sleep. As good as it gets as far as hostels get in a dorm environment? Only to be repeated in desperation… The hotel location can not be beat and with free breakfast, beach towels, airport transport, free club access, and a pool you can forgive a few things. There aren’t any power points near all the beds so you have to fend for yourself and hope no one steals your phone and the large room has an echo from the upstairs common space. Still highly recommend this place for a short stay in Miami on a budget. The hostel was  conveniently in the right location. Street over from the beach and surrounded by shops. Not far from other activities. Make sure you bring shower shoes, towel and wash clothes. Only thing provide is towel and hard to come by. Pack a small suitcase to fit in locked draw. Other than that good for a couple of days. I had a really nice time. The room was nice and spacious. Several showers, bathrooms, and sinks. Close to the beach and right in the middle of everything. Would definitely stay again. Hotel staff was great, friendly. Posh is located walking distance from southbeach , shops and grocery store! Breakfast and wifi included. Need to say more? It was my first hostel so i must admit i was a bit nervous but i was on a budget and traveling solo didn't make much sense to paid extra money anywhere else and I am glad i didn't cause i love this place!! I will be definitely returning back. The staff was extremely helpful and where available 24hrs. My first hostel experience and was a tad hesitant as I did not know just what to expect. The stay far exceeded all my expectations. Was very clean, neat and wonderful pleasant hostel staff. And surprisingly I slept very well. Just this alone would be worth the price. The added feature is all the wonderful people I got to meet at the hostel. Everyone was enjoying themselves and so friendly. Met a few that we are planning to meet here at the post the same week next year. The hostel environment for some is far better than being alone in a hotel room. Morning, noon, nite and well into the nite there was always someone to hang out with. Just sit around and talk and exchange life experiences. Never felt uncomfortable or lacking in my own personal space. Surely will be hostelling again and visiting the Posh. The Posh clearly sets a very high standard. Horrible experience. This hostel ruined my trip to Miami. I booked it for the week. I arrived at the hotel and stood there for ten minutes waiting to check in. The power was out. There were no lights in the hostel and I could not even charge my phone. The staff was rude. The man that showed me to my bunk tried hitting on me and made me feel uncomfortable. After finally settling in, an alarm went off for almost an hour. At this point I already wanted to leave after not even being there an hour. My room key repeatedly stopped working. Every time I went to use my room key I had to go to the front desk and have them fix it. At least five or six times. Twin bed very uncomfortable. Felt like no AC in the building very hot and humid. Breakfast was a joke they give you fruit loops and toast. The people around my bunk were rude and very creepy. I wanted a refund so I could stay in a different hotel. They refused to give me a refund despite how disappointed I was in the hostel. I booked monday-thursday and only stayed the first night because every other hotel in South Beach was completely booked. I stayed at the Catalina for the rest of my trip and will never ever ever return to Posh South Beach. I highly highly suggest no one ever wastes a penny on this dump. It was my first time in a hostel. The bathrooms smelled of poop from papers in the garbage. They were so small that you had to keep the door open to pee. To get on the top bunk, I had to climb up with shoes on and jump down to get to the ground. I asked to switch bunks and they said my bed was ready. However, when I checked, the last person's sheets and blankets were still on the bed. There is a language barrier with the maids. This is scary since we all want cleanliness in a hostel. The breakfast is basic continental. Lots of noise during the night but you can wear ear plugs. Showers are coed as are the rooms. There were 20 beds in the part I stayed in. I asked for a towel twice and wasnt brought one. I wont stay here again. I would like to stay where the maids understand english. I mean who then knows what is cleaned andd what hasnt been? no offense to anyone.They also didnt understand what a fitted sheet was either. Flore didnt seem to care much about her work. The front desk gal asked if the beds were ready and she just responded with no. There was no urgency from her to get it cleaned. She had thati just dont care look on her face. The security guy enjoys ordering people around. The location is really wonderful though. Close to beach, clubs and tours. This hostel is very close to the beach, bus stop to downtown miami, close to all restaurant & cafe. So everything is perfect Im not going to go into detail but it just wasnt my thing. Im not a fan of inconsiderate people which helped motivate my decision to go with an airbnb right away. I felt like i was back in boot camp For what and where it is, you can't get any better. The only complaint I have is noise. Noise from the street and other bars, Latin music bumping until 3am. Noise from being in a dorm and close to the bathrooms and showers. This is my first experience with a hostel, and very much appreciate the poshness, but I now know to ask for a bunk far away from the facilities. We were told, no Floridians allowed after booking there then refused to give us a refund. It was late so they rented us a room for $212 and then after all that I was eaten Alice by bed bugs. I have photos of the bed bug bites when I got up after a night’s stay that I’ll post. Great hostel  in SoBe yet quite night for sleeping, nice pool to refresh after day at beach block away.
It's a 10-minute walk to a JR station, the next one over from Maihama, the Disney stop. The hotel itself is nice, with reasonable breakfast selections included. Be warned that the rooms are small (not a rare thing in Tokyo, for the record) and you need to climb a set of stairs to get to the front desk. Clean room and comfortable for price. Breakfast good and simple. This hotel is not for travelers accustomed to large rooms. This was a small room with the beds close together and not much room for multiple suitcases. We didn't mind though because we were not visiting Tokyo to stay in our room. The free breakfast and staff were amazing! We would definitely return for both of those alone! This is a fine little hotel, close to a bus station that provides a shuttle service to Disneyland and Disney Sea. I was able to get by without having to head off to a supermarket or convienience store, and even if I did need to, both were within walking distance. If you want to save a bit of money while visiting the Disney parks, this is a great spot! They do not speak any English. The breakfast was not very good unless you want to eat only bread. Was a very small room. Did not have cribs. Did not have any appliances in the room. Had to always turn in the key when you left the hotel for any reason. Could not figure out how to work the tempostat unless you knew Japanese. I would not recommend this hotel for foreigners. Was a 17 minute bus ride to train station and bus to airport. Overall stay was great! Thanks for the staff on those days that we were there, very helpful and friendly. The rooms are not the cleanest. The beds are uncomfortable. Breakfast is OK, not the best but OK. The bathroom had a gas smell in it. Mold in the shower. The staff are excellent and very accomendating as much as they can be. However, because of the state of the hotel room, I would have switched to another hotel the first night if I could have but was not allowed to without expensive penalties because I booked all 4 nights ahead on hotels.com. The room was a bit small, but overall the service and stay was completely comfortable, and we were satisfied. The train station isnt too far away, and can easily be walked to as well. I would stay here again if I went back. Too much for the area and quality of the product. Room for 3 adults was tiny (as I expect most rooms here would be). We only stayed 2 nights and was just for sleeping, so it was suitable for our stay. Free breakfast was not lavish, but basic continental. Not bad for the price of the room. 15 min walk to Kasairinkaikoen station. Taxi to  Disney Resorts approx 1700-2000 yen (3 people)
This hotel is an old Sanatorium. It is a lovely old hotel and building, but does need upgrading. Our room was fine but the bathroom was small and basic, and you step back into the days it was a Sanatorium. We were only there for one night, we didn't use the spa. The staff were very helpful. I couldn't find a place in Denmark with thermal baths so I gave up on that search only to find out about this place when I was curious about Vejlefjord. We LOVED this place. We were so sad to leave after one night. We'll be back for sure!
Have stayed in may b hotels, always clean and welcoming Great location, near the train station and within walking distance to most major attractions. Great location, near the train station and within walking distance to most major attractions. I mean what I expience overall service is good but this hotel is not a 24 hours check in hotel! They started check in at 1300 hundred, I get there at 1000, and they said I can't check in at this point because the check in is not started yet. But eventually they checked me in . Just give y'all a heads up. I love Hotel B in Asukusa but this hotel is a couple of levels down. Breakfast was cold and they were rushing us out. Room size great. Great stay overall. Convenient location and excellent value. I was not expecting much out of this hotel, so it surprised me for the good location. It was at a nice walking distance of several temples and shrines and also from the commercial streets in Hakata section. There are many eating options at the hotel area and the front desk personnel are very pleased to point you to what you want to eat option. The room is quite small, but this is the norm in Japan. It is also a bit dated, but it was clean and everything in the room was working in good condition. Good shower and soap/shampoo available. I was by myself and I felt the room small. I could not imagine the same room used by two, which may happen. I booked this hotel after read the other reviews but seriously ... Choose another one ! I stayed There 2 Nights and There where the worst of my 3 week in japan! Terrible bed, we can ear our neibourgh going to pee!!!!! Room wall was dirty . And did a mention that the bed was very terrible !!!! Positive points: near the train station and vive free coffee in the lobby  1 star or 2 star max
Across the road from train station, in the middle of the old town with Christmas Markets and harbour . Extremely busy during our stay, but hotel staff remained friendly. Were in Constance for a sunny but extremely cold weekend in February. Our room had a great lake view and the hotel has a very cosy atmosphere. No distance to shops theatre and lake. Nice hotel close to station, city center and shops. Helpful and friendly staff  - good breakfast  Pleasant view over the lake Points for cleanliness and location. Otherwise, nothing 4-star about this hotel, even by German standards of accommodations. Amenities are few and far between apart from toiletries and a minibar. No robe, slippers, coffeemaker, heated towel rack. Internet continuously drops. And service is beyond poor. It's not simply German efficiency, the desk staff (no concierge) were curt to the point of dismissive. Especially the male staff. One answered every question -- including do you have a printer available to print a boarding pass? -- said tourist office across the street has all information. Thanks for nothing, especially as it regards the hotel itself. (BTW, no they do not have a printer available to guests, or a business center; nor are they willing to print guests' boarding passes.) Another male staff member refused to complete my check out because I had not paid in Euros. Indeed, my stay was prepaid through hotels.com -- in U.S. dollars -- but he delayed me a good 15 minutes arguing that since payment was not denominated in Euros, it was invalid. Oh, and he sought to charge me for breakfast when none was had. In all, terribly poor service. Doesn't begin to compare to the average German 4-star hotel. Will not stay again, and would not recommend to others. The hotel staff had their Christmas party with extremely loud music until 3 am. When calling at midnight they said it would be over soon. When calling at 1:30 They said the staff is enjoying the party. Not a customer focused hotel. Other negatives: room is small, old and cleanliness is so-so Positives: great location, old-charm lobby Very nice staff, friendly and helpful. The room was super nice and bed & pillows very comfortable. Very well located, right in front of the train station. The first room I got was freshly painted and smelled strongly from paint. And it did not have a desk at all. When I complained they changed me over to another room which was was quite dated but had a desk. It was ok but nothing special. I should say though that the location is superb, right at the station and the harbor.
Came here for New Years weekend, was quite nice! Hotel itself was very nice, modern, plenty of things to do in the hotel, spa, gym, bar, restaurant etc. Staff were quite friendly too and atmosphere was nice and relaxed. Room was a decent size and a great shower. Only issue was the location of the hotel. Not a huge amount of things to do around it, and the tube stop was a bit of a walk away. Other than that, great stay over all! Reception staff were warm, helpful, Genuine, accommodating and desiring to help. You get what you pay for. I wanted a safe cheap option in London. Hotel was very safe!! Room was very small, but bed was clean and comfortable, as was bathroom Hotel in desperate need of a paint job. The Bar Manager (not the Lobby restaurant) redefined oblivious and incompetent. No clue where he was most of the time I was there, just trying to get a drink. Went across the street to “The Corner. Bar” which I can not wait to return to. In the end, if I am traveling alone, or with just one other person, I would go here again. I would not bring my family. Room just too small. I wish this hotel was great but it was not. There was no hot water for two out of three days, this was brought to the attention of the front of house staff several times. We had the maintenance man visit, first when we were out but we were not given any information upon our return to the hotel and once when we were in the room. He suggested that we leave the shower running for half an hour to allow the water to pass air bubbles and heat up. This appears to be an ongoing problem at the hotel from what he said. The room had a sweetie by the radiator which was there upon our arrival and when we left, we did not place it there. This was raised as well with the staff there via a survey they send out half way through but nothing was done, so I am unsure of the point of the survey. I would not recommend this hotel to family or friends. I think that the hotel make a mistake by making bookings through Expedia Room Only and then try to charge £12 for breakfast. I only want toast and a coffee but no way I would pay £12 for that! There is a great cafe across the road that does a fabulous breakfast for £6.50. The single rooms are small but comfortable but outrageously hot. It's crazy: a good nights' sleep involves the body reducing its temperature - impossible in an oven like heat. Managed to get the radiator off and with the window open it was bearable the main purposes of choosing this hotel because it is very close to my son's Uni hostel and 10 mins walking distance to either Angel or Old street station. Basically only bathing towels, shower gel and shampoo are available. Clean but in need of refurbishment. Annoyingly badly connected on the tube for such a central location. Bus ride to tube is such an extra inconvenience. Nice hotel. Lovely room and it was nice and warm. The swimming pool was nice and so were other facilities The hotel is conveniently located, check in and check out were quick and efficient. Initially I had a room that smelled strongly of paint (hallways getting renovated), and staff were very helpful in moving me to a different part of a hotel. The room was spacious and bed comfortable. Pool and gym facilities were small but a definite bonus. Overall lovely stay. Arrived early morning in London. On a whim we went to the hotel and inquired about an early check in. Room was available and staff gladly accommodated us. Great to leave luggage and proceed with touring. Thank You! The rating of 3.5 is about right. The rooms are a bit dated but they do have a good gym, pool and  spa. Unless you need to be in the Shoreditch area this hotel is expensive though the staff were friendly. Lovely comfortable and clean hotel, with helpful friendly staff. The breakfast was really good and a wide choice and well cooked. The only minor point was that we tried to phone the reception from our room 3 or 4 times and got no answer. The lifts also need sorting out, as they seem to have a mind of their own when they actually arrive (gave up and used the stairs a few times), going to random floors and telling you that you were on other ones - bazaar!! ! It's cheap, and it's hard to complain about a place priced this low. And yet...walls are incredibly thin, as in yes, I can hear you turning pages in the next room thin. The room was clean but the decrepit condition of the wood (or wood-like) doors and trim in the hallways made me question the general approach to upkeep. That in turn led me to not want to even attempt the sauna or pool -- if they'll cut corners so drastically on basic upkeep, they're more likely to cut corners on things like sanitary condition of shared water facilities. There really isn't much nearby, though the Old Street station and Exmouth Market aren't THAT far away. All that said, it was cheap. Micro-room at five-star price, not even breakfast included, TV not working, looking at  a sometimes noisy street. NIce hotel, easy & quick checkin, no breakfast booked so cannot comment but we did eat in the bar which was very nice. Room was very warm and the aircon didnt appear to work so opened the window to cool the room down, free wifi in the room. Short  walk from the underground into the city, we would stay again. Hotel itself was fine and I was given a free room upgrade on checking in. However, I was woken at 4-00am by someone moving furniture or other items in a room/ storeroom nearby! Down for a funeral. Just the job . Close to underground and buses. Great leisure facilities. Did not eat at the hotel so no idea on food . Would use again Friendly staff, good location and transport links. Hotel a bit run down (although decoration was in progress) and the layout is needlessly confusing. Very clean, comfortable bed, quiet at night. Recommended. So long as you accept hotel has seen better days then it represents good value for money. Central with decent amenities nearby. Staff friendly and helpful. Food and drink reasonably priced All the staff are lovely and genuinely want to make sure you have a great stay. Thank you! This is in a relatively quiet area but much development going on. Not particularly close to Underground yet bus ride about 10 minutes walk. 15 minutes to Kings Cross Station. Very good and spacious and amenities rooms and great breakfast for 12 Pounds. The room was reasonable and well heated. We asked for extra towels and tea/coffee etc but this wasn't delivered. The pool was extremely busy which was a shame, but nothing they can do about that! Thistle Barbican City was a lovely place to stop for the night. The staff were incredibly pleasant and the room was lovely... when I eventually found it. Thistle’s only draw back was the maze of stairwells, wings, and annexes that made up each floor. Finding my room took a few moments, and wrong turns, but once I’d finally navigated the rabbit warren it was much simpler the second time around. I certainly wouldn’t let this put you off booking a room at the Thistle, it was a truly comfortable stay. Stay was pleasant and staff were friendly, plenty of facilities Enjoyed staying here for the location and friendly staff. All rooms highly recommended to have a mini bar fridge to store personal items etc. Gym could open earlier on weekends too. My room was near outdoor staircase, so draft would knock the door constantly which was annoying. And wifi kept cutting out Excellent location, friendly staff and comfortable and roomy room...which is not necessarily the norm for London accommodation in this price range! Good service. Room was clean and bed very comfortable. Breakfast was good with lots of choices. Would recommend. I want to revise my earlier post I was able to contact the hotel and my headphones were found which is great I want to thank the hotel for doing this and I am amending my negative review thank you It is a OK hotel but the location is not convenient. The bathroom is out of date. Bed was very uncomfortable, hot tub down for maintenance the duration of our stay. Not convenient to a tube stop. I didn't get air conditioner in my room and I ask to be upgrade and they couldn't, my kiss were not working and they man in the front desk wasn't nice at all The hotel is in a good location but is old and the rooms desperately need to be updated. The carpets are stained, the shower barely works. Breakfast buffet is excellent. Came here for New Years weekend, was quite nice! Hotel itself was very nice, modern, plenty of things to do in the hotel, spa, gym, bar, restaurant etc. Staff were quite friendly too and atmosphere was nice and relaxed. Room was a decent size and a great shower. Only issue was the location of the hotel. Not a huge amount of things to do around it, and the tube stop was a bit of a walk away. Other than that, great stay over all! A good hotel, clean yet small room, good size bathroom, TV, wifi, heating. No view from the room. A bit away from the main interests. Good for a business trip. Very helpful employees. Unfortunately the food wasn't great, the aircon didn't work and the bed was uncomfortable. Was in block adjoining main hotel. Walls paper thin so just hope you have no one staying next to you. Even normal conversation can be clearly heard. Only single glazed windows too. No good for business travellers who need a decent night's sleep. Nice hotel, really good location. Not a fancy modern hotel but in a good state and really clean and spacious. Not as expensive as most round there so worth the money.
This hotel was renovated such that a traditional davos hotel became a modern stunner...very nicely done. Very friendly staff! Location is great too, right in the middle of Davos Platz/Dorf. The room was larger than what I expected. The bed were very comfortable. The breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was great. There were a lot of choices of everything: juices, breads, jam/jellies, fruits, cheese, etc. The hotel is well decorated, giving a very relaxing and beautiful atmosphere. The staff were all friendly and nice. Highly recommend. We really enjoyed the hotel edelweiss. Not super fancy, but great location just off the bus route in Davos, was able to find parking nearby, and clean, well organized location, as well as a nice breakfast. Would stay again. Most enjoyable. Lovely alpine retreat We were in the basement but that was really good for exiting the hotel quickly out the back door with bags. Large kitchen, very small bathroom but very comfy for a family. Friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast room was stunning and the (free) breakfast range was extensive and delicious. We would love to stay again. Everything was perfect, it takes only 5 minutes walk to the congress center. The receptionists are so friendly and helpful. I also liked the breakfast. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. The price is good in camparison with the services and the quality. I will give a high rate for the cleanness as well. Excellent hotel, amazing staff, very well presented. Free WiFi throughout. Good breakfast. No safe or kettle facilities in the room.
Close to many attractions.. Friendly staff. Small but clean room #503 One of the best hotels i stayed in istanbul, very calm area and 5 min away from everything you need(taksim square, reataurants, shopping and metro) Good location but the rooms are kinda small. Overall, I would recommend for a short term stay. Favorable location but hotel needs extensive renovation. Room was too small for one bed yet there was two! Very warm and clean room. However, xxx mells of cst litter and tobacco are present.Sippery snow is not cleaned around the hotel, making it dangerous to get to the entrance of the building. Frond desk people vary from super friendly to very rude. Upon check out they refused to give me a copy of my receipt.
The hotel was nice enough - clean, quiet. However, it is advertised to have free parking. There is a parking garage when you get there with a sign for the hotel - this is NOT free. We asked as soon as we got to the desk to check in if they give us a new parking ticket to get out; she said no, we have to pay a the machine. When we inquired about the free parking that was advertised with the reservation, she looked outside and said all the free spots were taken (there were about five). We could block the other cars in if we would like and she'd call us if they needed to get out - not something we wanted to deal with nor put other guests through. Part of why we booked this hotel was because of the free parking. Disappointed. Everything else about the hotel was fine.
I have stayed in numerous hotels in Mexico over the years. This was a nice change to feel special and well attended. Bedrooms are ok. Bottom floor rooms against main building too noisy at night (electric motors). 2nd floor is best. Easy to walk from here or hop a bus downtown 1 block away The customer service was great!! I will definitely stay there again Great hotel and customer service. My only complaint would have to be that their breakfast was just above average. a nice hotel close to the main streets and close to Durango downtown , good security , and los portales restaurant in the hotel offers good food and very good prices plus happy hour , we stayed there  for a week , nice staff always ready to help, we will stay there again in our next trip to Durango
My only reason for not rating 5 stars across the board was that the room overlooked an interior atrium. I would have preferred a room with an exterior window so that I could tell if it was day or night. Convenient location for our event. Easy access to airport and beaches! Short stay - in from a late arriving flight and out early the next AM. Nice breakfast buffet! I would just say they need to be more careful with the room cleanness The hotel was nice and in a very good location. The hotel pool was a bit dated, but everything else was nice. This hotel made everything easy--from room service breakfast to airport shuttle. we stayed there when we were visiting University of Tampa, the hotel was beautiful, very clean and the staff was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the down town Tampa area. The Hotel is beautiful. The staff friendly and helpful. Although we had an issue checking in because our reservation could not be located everything worked out. The young lady at the reservation desk was wonderful. The location gave you easy on/off access to the highway. Bath ceiling should be cleaned before each check-in. Arrived late, and the staff was kind. The rooms were nice and the hotel was kept up well. There were a few nice dining options within the hotel. The only thing I wasn't satisfied with was no complimentary breakfast. That's the only improvement I would make. Only a few rooms have views to outdoors. Most face the atrium. Had a wonderful weekend at the Westshore Grand Lisa at the front desk made it extra special by sending a note and gift to our room in honor of celebrating a girls weekend with my daughters there. I have never had any do such a kind gesture for me. My family & I were having a great stay, until I tried to add a day to the stay & got the run around. Expedia told me to let the front desk know & the front desk told me to inform expedia. The desk quoted me $399/day & expedia quoted me $294/day. Really?? I have the best family that we made it work. Great hotel, clean rooms with nice staff. Outside pool on 9th floor! Awesome experience. Highly recommended. :) We spent 5 nights at this hotel. Loved the location, walking distance to restaurants, banks, shopping facilities. The staff was professional and helpful. Not adequate counter space for toiletries in bathroom and the room was rather picked up than cleaned. Bathroom floor was not mopped once in almost a week. Other than that, we had a pretty pleasant stay. I stayed in the Presidential Suite - it was terrible! The noise from people coming in an out of the elevator to go to the pool was constant. Also, there was some kind of utility room above the suite that was making noise every 30-45-seconds! It was constant pops, clinks, wooshes of water and other sounds. Terrible experience. Very friendly staff beautiful hotel great food however pool was overly crowded no towels seemed like pool was an afterthought This hotel is near everything. Huge mall across the street with a bunch of restaurants. The Tampa zoo was 10 mins away. If you want to go bar hopping ybor and soho are a ten minute drive. You can lyft everywhere. The only thing is the pool should be heated. It’s on the roof so when it’s windy it’s chilly. Despite checking in at 2am (11 hrs after check-in), staff would not accommodate a late (1pm/2pm) checkout, & suggested charging me additional 1/2 day stay for a 4pm checkout. No views - Room faces atrium with offices across, so curtains must be kept closed. Great hotel in every way. The only minor issue was that room service was an exceptionally long wait. Beautiful hotel. Great service. Only bummer was that the tried to charge for WiFi. What decade are they in? This hotel, newly refurbished and re-branded is very convenient to the airport. The room was very comfortable and quiet.The staff is great, there are some excellent restaurants very nearby. A good place to stay if your in Tampa for a day or two quick visit. Everything was very nice and clean. Great location Very nice hotel. Loved it! Housekeeping removed my belongings before my check out. I’m very upset. Softest pillows and beds Great area..great hotel. Staff is helpful and courteous. Beds comfortable. Everything you need is either in the hotel complex or across the street at the mall,shops or restaurants. Maybe it was just the room I was staying (517) but heard the pulleys of the elevators all night long. Not the actual elevator doors and such, just the mechanism of the elevators. Needless to say, affected sleep for 2 nights The staff was terrific but had several issues with the room. e.g. toilet wouldn't flush, TV didn't work, one of the drapes did not retract. Appreciated free shuttle to airport. Stayed here for a night as part of a family visit/baseball game weekend. Room was clean and bed was very comfortable. Pool is pretty small, but the fact that it's on the roof is cool. Will stay here again if price is right. Great hotel!! Friendly staff although though valet was slow. Only had one worker for valet during the duration of our stay. Fast check in, clean, quiet, spacious Hotel is convenient. Staff (front desk) was excellent. Room clean and very comfortable. We would definitely stay there again. Got best price through travelocity (hotel did not match pricing when we called directly). Parking was ample and free. The not-so-great:  [1] I asked for a wake-up call on one day ... never got it. Fortunately, I used my iPhone to wake me up  [2] Wi-Fi was free ONLY because we were members of the club. Otherwise if $14.95 per day (absurd that it is not free for everyone). [3] Parking garage signage is lacking. If you park at the farthest corner from the entrance to hotel there are NO signs to lead you to the hotel entrance. [4] On day we checked out, the main elevators were shut down for 'refurbishment'. You would think they would put signs along the hall to the elevator that the mains were not working and that we should use the side elevators. We had to walk all the way to the elevator only to fully retrace our steps to the side elevators. Annoying. This was the second time I have stayed at this hotel. I was in town for a medical procedure. The staff was wonderful. My husband actually got sick and needed to go to the ER and we were given late check out that we didn't know we would need. The staff at Shula's was kind enough to bring soup to our room. My floor was newly renovated. The hotel is across the street from restaurant's and shopping which makes it convenient. The only awkward thing is it is connected to an office complex which seems a bit strange...hard to navigate a bit in the lobby. This hotel would be perfect if there were a Starbucks in the lobby. There is a small coffee bar but I didn't even notice it until ready to check out during my second stay. I just stayed one night before travel but I enjoyed the comfortable room and nice hotel. Not only is the hotel under construction, but the rooms given to Travelocity customers face offices- yes, you get to watch people working and starring at you. When I asked for a more private room, I was told, this is the kind of room you booked,   sorry. And a cup of coffee costs 5.50 Again, I once am pleased with my stay at the hotel Generally good experience. Well trained staff. The room was neat, clean and orderly. Furnishings were above average standard. My room was located on the Atrium side, so no exposure to the outdoors. In addition, the room was on the top floor and a reasonable distance from the elevator shafts. Never-the-less, there was a continuous sound transfer from the elevator equipment. I was able to ignore it and had a good night's sleep. Love staying at this hotel. Polite, pleasant staff, and great accommodations. Close to the highway for easy access as well as two shopping malls/ restaurants. Highly recommended! Love this hotel when visiting Tampa! The staff is great, the service is excellent and the cleanliness is second to none. Easy highway access, shopping and dining are close by. Great spot! hospitality at its finest. we would recommend this hotel to everyone The best so far! I love this hotel, if you want celebrity treatment for a reasonable price stay here. I will be back :) Hotel was in a great location. They should put some money in the pool area it was lacking creature comforts. There was no breakfast options, onsite they had a overpriced Starbucks want-a-be kiosk with few options. Location convenient for our weekend going to university of Tampa Experience was good, it would have been great if there was complimentary coffee and a better breakfast option than the overpriced kiosk I stayed fro 8pm till 330 am Tuesday night , I believe it was around 260 or 270 and very nice place but they put me with my window facing trafic three story's below and it was loud from the cars stoping and starting Fine clean rooms, A/C works great which you need in Tampa, Fl. Shuttle fast to arrive. Staff competent and helpful. I did not like the fact that the internet was not free. Visiting Tampa to see a Rays game so this was an ideal hotel for a one night stay. Convenient for Airport, International Mall etc. Odd curved-shape room, overlooking car park level 2, I think, but very clean, bed had crisp white cotton sheets..... Would ask for a higher floor and a view next time.Breakfast too expensive but plenty of good choices nearby. Wouldn't considerate the hotel for longer though.......more for business/salespeople etc. Food excellent, service very attentive, and since we did a wedding here, Mariella, in charge of events, was the sweetest, and helpful during all the preparation for it. Many members of the staff deserve praise for their hard work. Thank you! Great stay. Strawberry festival was a lot of fun. We watched the Reba McIntyre concert. Man can she sing. The strawberries were amazing. If you have time you should check out the Lowery Zoo. Many interesting animals on the endangered species list. I have stayed at this hotel a dozen times over the past year. This past stay, they were unable to find my Orbitz booking, followed by an issue with an Expedia credit card not working. None of this having anything to do with me. I had to wait 30 minutes  after a long day and flight (about 8 or 8.30 pm) while they sorted out their issues and they never offered a glass of water, any sort of apology, a drink at the bar, nothing. Basically I sat in the hall for 30 minutes. After all my business! Got into the room and I easily heard every word of the person's phone conversation next door and the air con sounded like a fog horn. Had dinner in the restaurant and had to go get the waiter because he was too busy reading his phone to notice me sitting there. I will not go back. Nice stay, but no laundromat or complementary breakfast. Nice pool and exercise room though and good restaurant and room service. Desk did call sister property Holiday Inn across the street and they let us use their laundromat. Beautiful hotel, super clean, plenty of amenities, friendly staff, easy access to parking garage and close to everything. I would definitely book here if I return back to Tampa. ;) It was a little depress when we got our room, thirth floor with no view at all in our fist visit to Tampa, I told the front desk agent and he kindly give us the best view in the 9 floor, pools floor also, made our Christmas and my girls birthday, very happy!!! Thank you. The lobby is nicely appointed and there are nice restaurants there, but the rooms are small and the furnishings are old. Internet will cost you $13.95 PER DAY. There is no refrigerator or microwave in the room, however you can order them for just under $50 each. The room never quite cooled down. Just ... nooo. Very nice hotel. I would have liked to have stayed more than one night but my schedule would not allow. It is easily accessible to some many venues. The staff was polite, courtesy, and extremely helpful, which began with the valet at the entrance and on through the hotel. Just a few minutes from TPA airport, location was convenient. Shopping is close by too. Hotel was clean and rooms were nice. Front desk folks were welcoming and friendly. Our first bartender was excellent. There is a Schula's Steakhouse in the hotel. Higher prices, but good food. Very nice hotel and staff room was very clean and everything was in its proper place would def stay again Great place to stay. In the center of everything. Magnificent restaurants and shopping right accross the street. This will be  my 1st choic every time I am in Tampa. Noisey elevators. You can hear them in the rooms Perfect location. Classy yet comfy/cozy hotel & rooms. It was very nice. Much better than my room on our cruise ship! Free in room  HGTV! VERY comfortable beds, large bathroom- bedroom area was spacious. Free shuttle to the Airport was extremely helpful!!! 7 minutes to the airport was AWESOME! Basic hotel. Nothing special. Basic hotel. Nothing special. Basic hotel. Nothing special. Basic hotel. Nothing special. The place was spotless. No problems what so ever. Staff excellent. Beautiful stay, clean, friendly and overall excellent stay! This Hotel was very nice a little better then what I am normally stay at the staff was very friendly, free wine on Mondays and close to the mall. The beds where High and hard and the room seemed cramped lucky it was only me and not a family of 3 or more the restaurant in the hotel was great but I think a little over priced $4.00 for a can soda i mean come on. But over all it was a Pleasing stay. Dont have anything wrong to say, everything was good. The price was good Small room; dated; certainly not deserving of four stars. Wonderful hotel, great location. We needed to get an early flight so it was perfect for our needs. There was blood on the bathroom door that was never cleaned. Blood on the robe hanging in same door. There was a large red stain on carpet looked like red pop or wine. We never got fresh towels and had to call to get them. Other wise it was a nice stay. No Free internet or reasonable price access. Otherwise the room was very good.
We chose this hotel as it was close to the airport and car rentals. Good value for the money. Room was small but clean and well looked after. For a night of sleep than no complain. Was given a room where has poor wifi connection and the area are not barrier free therefore pull luggage will have to be carried at time. Room has basic facilities. Excellent option if you need to stay in Porto area for a night during flights. The breakfast is paid separately, 6.50 euros, but it's worth it. The staff is very helpful and all the times want to make your experience a good one. I needed to leave my bags during a small flight and they didn't charge me at all. Good choice if you don't want to go until Porto downtown. Wifi very good. I didn't use parking, so I can't give an opinion about that. Good place after or before flight, very cloce to airport. convenient to airport excellent service beds were too small It is good because it is near the airport. You can walk to the airport or call a shuttle bus (very cheap). I stayed for one night. I enjoyed very much. Good room rate nice hotel near the airport and metro. helpful and friendly staff. room is simple, but enough. Breakfast is also good.
Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone . Fab location and very friendly staff. Excellent location, excellent security, impeccable staff. Definitely be checking in again in the near future Loved the location of the hotel, staff service brilliant. Rooms fabulous..... Veronica in the kopplecafe is a excellent bartender. Loved the Renaissance, going in June to try the Barcelona hotel. Had a great stay but had to pay a deposit of 75 euros per night which none of us were aware of and were told we would receive in 2 weeks time with no reciept given. The location was great and in the heart of amsterdam which made easy access for everything. The hotel was pleasant. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only issue we had was that our room was not set up for 3 people despite being booked for 3. We wasted an hour sorting this out when we arrived. The staff resolved this and invited us for a meal and drinks. The breakfast was fabulous. Location was great for access to train station and attractions and a short tram ride to the museums. Staff were helpful in providing tourist information, maps, booking tickets etc. The negatives are that the beds were extremely uncomfortable - very soft & both rolled into middle. We had a family room which had a locked adjoining door and there was no soundproofing so we were woken by next doors child giggling and could hear every word of their conversation so no good if you're a light sleeper! Other than that the hotel was excellent - breakfast - although pricey like everything in Amsterdam- was absolutely superb! Would stay again! A nice relaxing few days helped by friendly and knowledgeable staff at the hotel Ideally located, get the tram from the airport then a ten min walk. Lovely staff, bed was so comfy. I di not order breakfast with my stay (mistake), received bill and £29.50 each for brekkie! Way too much, had an Italian meal across the road two courses and wine cheaper than the Breakfast, otherwise very good Hotel is in a great location but that is all it has going for it. It’s dated, rooms are small, noisy. You will find a better bed at premier inn. The bar is very poor and have no clue how to make any of the cocktails in there menu. The room keys did not work. The bathroom was tiny and the shower poor. Great location staff was  helpful kind and great Upgrades The hotel is conveniently located in a great area of Amsterdam and easily walkable to many places. They gladly added an extra bed to the room for an additional traveler who joined our trip last minute. Friendly staff and overall great experience. On arrival was charged 50 euros and also if you wanted to watch any TV there was an additional 24 euros charged for 24 hours. Also went out for the day and came back to my room not cleaned. The response was that because I put a sign out for more towels, they read it as “privacy please”, signs should be more clear and not as confusing for cleaners to avoid this disappointment again. This was my fourth time staying at Renaissance and I thoroughly enjoyed the three day stay. The room is very comfortable and always clean. The staff was exceptionally helpful and the facilities (i.e. The gym) were most enjoyable and in excellent condition. Staying at this hotel makes Amsterdam as enjoyable as possible and I feel like royalty when staying at the Renaissance. The most helpful and friendliest of staff; couldn’t have made us feel more welcome. Perfect location for cafes, town, shops and red light district. Will definitely be staying here again :) Excellent weekend and well catered for by the Hotel staff. Was my brothers 50th birthday and he and his wife were upgraded foc!! Complimentary lounge passes, breakfast and bottle of champagne in their room. Staff upgraded my wife and I to be able to join my brother which they didn’t have to do. Excellent concierge service recommending an wxcllent Chinese restaurant on our first night. Superb location to walk to all sights. Loved the whole weekend! Thank you! The location and the staff are great. The room was also nice. The downside is that the walls are thin, you can hear everything going on in the hall and whenever a door is closed. I would definitely stay there again, with earplugs. This is a great hotel , conveniently located bang in the Middle of Amsterdam , only a 10 min walk from the station We really liked the location, it was so closed to nice restaurants, very very convenient. The hotel served excellent breakfast, staff is very friendly and efficient! Great location, pleasant staff & the most comfy beds! Room unavailable on arrival. Unhappy with Travelocity experience on this booking. Location is central to most things to do in Amsterdam Staff was great, concierge was exceptional!! Had to change next leg of our trip . Bar prices were expensive front desk clerk would not look up my marriott number Overall very good there was a problem with the heat going off and never fixed. You should have fixed it or moved is I think Expensive hotel lacking amenities! Close to train station and center of town. Slept in a broken bed. Not impressed for the money it cost to stay there! very pleased with the stay and i will repeat it again Clean rooms and friendly staff. We had a family room for four and found it extremely comfortable. The location was ideal. I found the room very comfortable and I slept well. I would stay here again. I have been staying at this hotel for more than 10 years and it never disappoints. Perfect central location, close to train station and within walking distance to all attractions. The staff was so friendly, kind and helpful. the room was spectacular. Only complaint is the cost of WiFi. This hotel has an excellent location just minutes to the train, boats and walking to the life and museums of the city. No aquatic amenities like pool or hot tub but the fire is nice and the hotel staff and facilities are top notch. Was a nice place to stay. Would consider staying here again. Highly recommended. Absolutely amazing hotel, in an amazingly central location. We paid a very good price for what i think was included and we are definitely returning!! The only fault i would say was the room we were in was right by the flag pole, and this got quite noisy at night! Apart from that all the staff were very friendly they couldnt do more to help you out, some one is always available! Its also the little things that make this hotel stand out such as bringing toothpaste up to the room, or giving out hotel umbrellas when it was raining! Brilliant place! ! Good location and excellent staff! Staying over the weekend gave us the benefit of the full american breakfast on sat and sun. The hotel reception area was good. We had the superior room as there were 3 of us. The 3rd bed is a sofa bed and the layout of the room was a bit strange. The hotel is on the expensive side and apart from the service and staff it doesn't quite make it a 5 star for me. More of a good 4 star. I would recommend this hotel for the service and staff alone. Loved the location of the hotel, staff service brilliant. Rooms fabulous..... Veronica in the kopplecafe is a excellent bartender. Loved the Renaissance, going in June to try the Barcelona hotel. Had a great stay but had to pay a deposit of 75 euros per night which none of us were aware of and were told we would receive in 2 weeks time with no reciept given. The location was great and in the heart of amsterdam which made easy access for everything. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone . Fab location and very friendly staff. Excellent location, excellent security, impeccable staff. Definitely be checking in again in the near future
Very good hotel helpful staf room was beautiful Very good hotel and very good staff Very good hotel neet and clean food was awesome service is??????????? ? nice hotel sehej inn location is very good
Great hotel-super clean, wonderful staff, great views. If we are ever in Aosta again we will definitely stay at La Roche. Amazing recommend it My wife and I were beginning to walk a section of the Via Francigena from Aosta to Lucca. This hotel was a bit out of the city for us, but it was a wonderful place to stay. Not to be missed is the outstanding restaurant across the road La Chaumiere. Very nice people. Returned the Kindle we left - great service. Good location 4 km above Aosta. Village shop in walking distance. Very equipped room with wonderful view. Garden and sun loungers.
Overall appearance of the hotel is not good. Remote location. Breakfast is very light and only vegetarian food available (cerials and breads). Air conditioning was not working and thermostat was never switched on. When I complained about it, the receptionist stated that they are aware of air conditioning issues of some rooms and apologized. Not sure why don't that fix it though they are aware of it. Also, I don't understand why they accommodated us that room. Overnight stay for skiing in Tahoe. Nice little hotel by the airport. Comfortable beds, nice shower and bathroom. Even though the hotel is a little dated, it was a good place to spend the night. Was in Reno due to a medical emergency in the family. This place was close to the hospital, and was picked from a list provided to Expedia. Turned out to be a nice, comfortable place. Nothing fancy, but clean, nice place with excellent staff. They were very sensitive to my needs and concerns. ice machine didn't work, no mini fridge, sagging bed, took 15 minutes to brew coffee in the lobby, had to go to front desk to get the tag for the maids to request do not disturb sign. Terrible location right next to noisy freeway and warehouses. Trash still in room, no one ever at counter, and no toilet paper the next day after they cleaned the room This La Quinta is in need of remodeling . We have stayed in La Quinta in Phoenix Az and that hotel was amazing. So when I got here you can see why It was a disappointment . Breakfast was just bread items and some fruit no eggs or sausage protein . The rooms are very outdated . Locks should be changed. Overall we were very disappointed in our stay. We usually like the LQ brand of hotel but this is an old LQ in need of major updating. It was a one night stay, the room was not the cleanest and the breakfast was a bare minimum, got breakfast somewhere else after leaving. Bed was to springy for me. Guess we got what we paid for. Staff was nice and efficient though. A fairly low cost and convenient location for an early morning flight. Aging facility with clean room and no issues. If you're looking for a hotel experience, this isn't it. As a place to sleep, it was very comfortable and surprisingly quiet. Overall good, but breakfast wasn't that good. Even location is way outside downtown, thought it will be walkable or at least 5 mins drive, but much longer. My reservation was for 3/23. When I arrived I was told they had me arriving on 3/30. They didn't have a room available for me. I cancelled the reservation for 3/30 and went to another hotel. Room was not clean (hair in the bath and on bathroom floor, trash behind bedside cabinet etc) and the room just seemed tired, shabby and uncared for - not what I expected based on previous experiences at La Quinta. The staff were extremely pleasant though. Was driving from Bay Area to Idaho ahead of a major storm and simply needed a place to sleep Everything was great except the pet area. Looks like it had not been cleaned up in a LONG TIME. Easy access to the 395 freeway and moving around even good price if you book it in time really worth your money:) Total experience was ok. Staff was helpful, the girl (Brooke) at reception was very friendly. I missed amenities such as fridge and microwave. I always enjoy staying at Reno LaQuinta Inn. It is located near the airport,  it is close to restaurants,  shopping, and the freeway. Dirty yellow towels water wouldn't stay the same temperature. I have stayed at La Quinta anytime I travel. I had never stayed at the one in Reno but had good experiences everywhere else. This one did not meet their usual standards. Staff was very friendly however the room was not clean. The shower sounded like it was going to fall through the floor when you stood on it. The motel definitely needs a good scrubbing and updating. I would not recommend this motel. The only positive was it was close to Renown Hospital where we were visiting family. This hotel has been consistently good over the past few years of frequent stays to visit family. I have a dog so their dog-friendly policy is very appreciated! The rates are very reasonable, pleasant staff, clean rooms, and location provides easy access to freeway and surrounding areas. I am most impressed at the cleanliness of a room that permits dogs! One might expect stained rugs and a fowl odor, but the rooms are impeccable! Toss in the friendly and helpful staff and you have a great experience. Thank you, La Quinta, for another good visit!. Love, dog friendly as always. Friendly folks. Breakfast could've been better. I got in late and was out early for a flight, the units are clean and comfortable it’s just an older property. First room had mold in the bathroom. The clerk on duty was awesome though. The out side areas are warned down. Some litter. I’ve stayed at other La Quintas across the country and this property was the worse as far as the exterior areas are. Got stuck in a snow storm on our way back to California. Beds were comfortable, the drains in the showers were plugged and did not drain. Cable tv was out so the television was useless. Called the desk and asked for an extra blanket and crib and no one ever showed up. I've already spread the word about my experience. The hotel was located in a unattractive part Reno, upon arriving to our room immediately notice stained carpets bad smell dust along walls patched carpet mouse droppings in nite stand drawer, need I say more, but to top off our unpleasant stay I was double charged by an inexperienced staff with no manager on duty to help Would be nice to have a microwave and small refrigerator without adding to cost. At least provide tea and hot cocoa with coffee in rooms. Over all liked conviences. Only other thing was not liking to hear toilets being flushed in middle of night.. It was very clean and comfortable. Definetley would stay there again. pet friendley hotel. dogs stay free. no extra charges. have 2 great grassy dog areas. they even have poo poo bags there. room was clean and tidy. had a fridge and microwave too. overall a great stay with our dogs. Other La Quinta were much more lush than this one. Bare minimum. It was clean, but sparse, no lotion, no extras. I liked the fact that a centennial breakfast was included. The staff was very polite and happy to be of assistance. Stayed at a La Quinta in Fort Lauderdale which was fantastic, unfortunately this one was not even close!! Picture a Motel 6 with a La Quinta sign in it! No extra blankets, towels did not show up. Breakfast buffet was messy. Clean rooms but cable did not work Desk person was rude and not helpful when I called to ask about shuttle from airport. I wanted to know if shuttle would be available when my flight was scheduled to arrive about 10:30PM. She just kept repeating that the driver goes home at 11:00PM. Since the hotel is 5 minutes from the airport it seemed possible I could still ride the shuttle but she never gave a clear answer and finally said to get a cab. It might be useful for hotel to know when I and another female customer did call a cab he refused to take us because it was not a profitable fare since hotel is close to airport. That left 2 women late at night trying to walk and find the hotel carrying luggage. Did I mention I am 72 and had been in transit from Europe for over 30 hours? I've stayed at this LaQuinta many times. It's usually clean and quiet and I feel safe and comfortable there. This time however, the bathtub was pretty dingy and dirty. When I turned on the water, only the hot water worked; the cold water knob just spun around and no water came out. The scalding hot water made it impossible to take a shower. I'm guessing the cleaning staff had the same problem which would explain the dirty tub. I notified the desk at check out and they apologized, but it seems like this problem should have been addressed prior to renting the room. I had just come from another Reno hotel just as people from Burning Man were leaving the festival. At the previous hotel near the airport the staff was frazzled, agitated, unfriendly and mostly unable to cope with the influx of BM crowd and seemed like they just wanted everybody to leave. They had closed the pool in an abject panic. At La Quinta, the entire staff was sensible, calm and seemed to enjoy dealing with the high demand of dusty guests. They did not cut a single corner or break composure for a second over the course of the hours I was there. Every amenity was open like any other time. This is a great staff. . We paid way more then I would normally pay for this hotel because of lack of hotel choices. Overall this is an average hotel and not worth more then $50. Very clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Conveniently close to airport. Just bad from beginning to end. It does however have that good old down home crack house feel to it. The staff was very nice. The hotel is very dated and needs a facelift. But otherwise good for the price. Pet friendly, spacious,  very easy to find, lots of parking, inexpensive Exterior of building needs work, broken concrete steps. Wood needs paint. The interior of our room was excellent. Would sta Y here again I've stayed at this hotel before and was very happy. This time, however, I had a room facing the freeway. It was very noisy. In this room, the beds were old- they had divots on each side with a high spot in between, and they made noise when you got in and out. The pillows were very lumpy- it was hard to get comfortable. The room was clean and the staff was nice. Holiday weekend hotel rates are a supply and demand operation. Raising the rates does not raise the amenities. Pro travel tip. Do not travel on holiday weekends if it can be avoided. Ancient facility. No elevator. Rusted staircases. Exterior entrances to rooms. Very 1970's. Better options available. In town for business needed to balance cost with closeness to the airport. This was it - an old school feeling motel-ish inn on the freeway, walking distance from the airport. Lots of road noise, work crews coming and going (3 am truck startups), crying babies, foot traffic outside the rooms, all which open to the outside. Not the best, not the worst. Good internet, clean rooms, decent beds. Pretty typical old La Quinta . Hotel is ok - comfortable, characterless. There is a swimming pool and free muffin/coffee in the morning. It was nice and convenient, walking distance to the airport. Staff were very professional and friendly and the room itself was clean, comfortable. The hotel is in a relatively industrial area and right across from a major post office facility. The exterior is quite old/dated looking. The hotel served its purpose for a family business trip for a few days. The staff was very welcoming at 11:30 pm when we arrived. It was not made clear to us that we would need to take a cab at that hour of the night, so we had to spend unexpected money on this. Our room was comfortable. It was nice to have breakfast in the room as we were not familiar with the area. It was a nice surprise that we could get a ride to and from the casino for dinner. Bed was comfy, room smelled of smoke. It's like an overpriced motel 6. I have never stayed at a pet friendly hotel and I will never stay in another one again. The room was disgusting. I was afraid to touch anything in the room and we were very uncomfortable. The front desk staff though was very polite. Hotel room was not clean. Trash was not emptied and the shower floor was so dirty, that we waited to check in to another hotel to shower. Beds were comfortable, but sheets were either stained or also not changed out.
It was a mixed experience; we booked this holiday as we saw the pictures and amenities which showed that it had a playground and was child friendly; however when we arrived the kids playground was in a state and we asked for it to be cleaned and the response was we do not offer this facility at this time of year which was really upsetting and frustrating. It just showed that the service was not upto the 5* As they weren’t willing to clean the area which I believe a 5* hotel should be all year round: specially when they had staff cleaning other areas regularly   The room service food was delicious. The room was very nice with a pleasant view. Clean, comfortable, luxurious, regular beach shuttle, free land of legends tickets and transport, amazing dinner and breakfast service- outstanding, definitely 5* Very nice stay and have good relaxing days whith shoping in antalya This hotel sucks. Very slow service. Old and smelly furniture. Their AC are so weak to cool the room to acceptable tempratures. Everything was nice except the spider net by the bed and very weak wifi. We stayed at this hotel for 10 days on a beds and breakfast basis. The location is excellent. Fantastic breakfast. We had a beautiful Seaview Room. Warm and welcoming staff. Can't fault anything except an indoor swimming pool would be nice. Will definitely return. An awesome hotel with all available facilities and have an excellent services i like the hotel i like room but its old i stayed in suite it was nice the breakfast good Excellent customer service, nice environment, great house keeping and close to the beach and free shuttle service for the beach. I loved the hotel. Best hotel for business travel, with a nice gym and spa. Don’t expect the overcrowded all inclusive style of other Turkish hotels. Friendly staff and great buffet service. In room dinning is good but many hasn’t changed in 3 years. The hotel itself is comfortable, clean, and warm placed central enough for a 20min walk into the old town. They had the added bonus of a day to the aqua theme park Land of Legends which was a lot of fun. The pool area is also nice and a quick walk down the steps to the beach. There is plenty of cats in the area which didn't bother me being a animal lover and the Antalya people really look after them Always a pleasure to stay at Downtown Rixos Had a great and relaxing time , mixing work and pleasure Had surgery during my stay there. Staff were very good although I was very annoyed that the only time I had food from outside the hotel was stopped in front of other guests and made to wait for a manager to come and explain their policy of no food from outside the premises to me even though I told the staff member to dispose of the food instead of making me wait. Being drowsy from my meds I would have normally just thrown the food of left it on the floor at the reception but instead just entertained them. I was annoyed as this was done in front of other guests. A.C. in room not working. Breakfast quite extensive and good. The Hotel is near the beach, besides it provides shuttle to the beach with towels and beach chairs. The best choise is to book a room with the Sea view, otherwise it will be dark and noisy because of the traffic in rush hours. Thanks to the Guest Relations representative of the Hotel I had changed my room to another one. A young man kindly offered me another room which was more calm and sunny including nice sea view. Nice hotel 5 min walk down to the beach 20 min to the old town. Nice location. Hotel is very quiet unlike the one next to it Falez...  Other down point is the stuff at the reception not helpful at all we had to discover touristic places by ourselves
Beautiful hotel, couldn’t fault how it looks and the rooms are beautiful. But very unhelpful staff, there was a power cut for most of the day and night they didn’t offer any complimentary drinks, no phone call to let us know when it was back on we just had to go out all day and night and take a chance when going back and hope it was back on. When asked for an update the manager was rude and VERY unhelpful. When we left to check out (baring in mind we spent most of our time out of the hotel) there was wine and beers charged to our room which we did NOT buy. Staff were also unhelpful about that didn’t have a clue how it got onto our room bill... Made us sit around for ages whilst they all spoke to each other trying to find out what had happened. Eventually let us leave without paying but it was clear they did not believe us and we had to put up a fight. Not very good service or staff for a 4 star hotel. Unbelievably rude. Great location, friendly, helpful staff, clean comfortable rooms. Would not change anything about this hotel. Everything was ok. The rooms could be cleaned a lot more diligently and the front desk staff needs to learn a few manners on politeness and respectfulness. Location is outside city center but worked great because of tram stop in front of hotel. Well-priced hotel near market street, Heiniken, museums, canal and two tram lines. Smartly decorated. Note some rooms are daylight basement or garrets. I would book again without reservation - or with a reservation (HA!). In walking distance to everything you'd want to do. The staff awesome; the bar quaint with a descent selection if winding down for the night. The room view was nice, the bed comfortable, and the shower refreshing. Thanks! ! Very nice experience. The staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean. Enjoyed the location and quality of hotel. The front desk staff were excellent, the bar staff were helpful but not seasoned professionals. The room was nicely decorated and quiet like I requested. Loved the Nespresso maker in the room. Bathroom was a oddly placed. Overall recommend staying here! Hotel is in great location, tram stop from stain just outside, this also takes you to Dam square etc. Rooms comfortable and nicely styled. Staff really helpful and friendly. I would recommend it . So comfortable, fantastic coffee in the room & lovely decor. Quite small room but quiet & the staff couldn't do more. Bikes were lovely to hire (3 days!) to explore the city & everything was close to the hotel. Food lovely too. Draft from window  made room cold light shade moving from cold. Made staff aware gave me extra blanket lol I come here often for work reasons and love it. Central convenient and comfortable, all I need. Helpful staff and staff available 24 hours. Mini fridge in room stocked with water and juice daily. Really nice bathrooms and beautiful canal views. Had a very nice stay at Notting Hill Hotel this past week. Excellent location, very pleasant and helpful staff.The rooms are very clean and adequately furnished. Price/quality ratio is very good. Very practical. Would recommend for people who don't care for sumptuous lobbies Hotel located in outlying district with few dining options. Initial interaction with staff was cold and unconcerned with issues until much pressure applied. Hotel very clean and rooms nicely appointed. Would choose another option on future visits to Amsterdam. Overall, a very nice place to stay for the money. Location is great, being right next to the largest open air market in Amsterdam. Also right on the Tram line which was fantastic. Service was also very good and accommodating. However I would recommend that you not book a room on the basement floor, as the sidewalk traffic is very noisy at all hours. Our bed headboard was also on the other side of the wall of a storage room, where employees were going in and out of at all hours. The walls were pretty thin... so you can hear everything. Also, the onsite restaurant and breakfast was unreasonably priced. Very happy with our stay in Notting Hill hotel. Great location, excellent customer service, lovely room.. highly recommend it. The bar tender was excellent and showed exceptional service. Great hotel with lovely staff. Well located with easy access to attractions. Tram stops right in front of hotel and it's about 10-15min to city centre with number 4 tram. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was big as well with a rain fall shower head. Extra points for Sara (Front Office Manager) for the exceptionally good customer service that she provided. Great hotel. Would stay again. Great place in safe area to discover Amsterdam. All staff were helpful and courteous. Definitely would recommend this hotel to stay at again. Tram stop outside the door to the railway station. Lovely hotel great friendly staff but I found beds very firm and didn't sleep well. Looks better online than in person. The tiny bathroom in the tiny room has a frosted glass door with a transparent border. Why hotel designers think this is ever a good idea in a room I'll never understand. It's okay for the price because it was really inexpensive, but nothing to recommend or visit again. Nobody help us with our lagguage  to arrive to the lobby high stairs for heavy items  , receptionist no nice at all , everything is extra and breakfast is poor and expensive for €20 a lot of noise in the room at night This was the perfect location where we could walk or get the tram across the road but out of the main hub of Amsterdam that is so busy. Staff were very helpful and friendly Staff were super helpful and courteous. We had a water leak and when that couldn't be fixed immediately we were put in a better room, and staff were very apologetic about it. This hotel is very nice and has a very welcoming staff. It does have a pretty small lobby and the elevators are rather slow but I found my room to be very comfortable, especially the bed. I wish there would have been an ice machine (you have to request a small bucket of ice from the bar) or a mini fridge but overall it was a pleasant stay. the staff is excelent. the infrastructure very good The service in the restaurant outstanding Nice hotel with a large room on the lower floor. Hugh bathroom and King Size bed. Hotel close to market, museums and tram line. Had a 4 day break in Amsterdam staying at hotel Notting hill. This is a really nice hotel with friendly staff. It situated out of the main centre about a 10 min tram ride number 4 route. The tram stops outside hotel which it makes it very easy to explore city.
Oasi Village Hotel is a great value for the money. Away from the hustle and bustle of Milan but not too far. Rooms are well equipped and clean. We got upgraded to an Executive/Luxury suite for one of our room, and it was great with separate room for the kids. Nice place with the feel of Europe. Comfortable beds. Our room was quite noisy as it was next to the street with a thin wall. The air condition was not good. I only stayed one night at this hotel and got in quite late. All I can say is the hotel was clean and the rooms were pretty large. They will do luggage storage which is convenient. The only negative thing I have to say is that it was a bit warm in the room. I guess it was early in the season and they still had the heaters on. Other than that I would say it was nice.
I stay here often for work,my only complain I guess is that I like room 202 and the last time I stayed there I was in room 215 which was fine just had a lot of smokers on that side where as if you wanted to leave your door open which I often do for the breeze I was really annoyed by the cigarette smoke being channeled into my room hate the disgusting smell of cigarette smoke.Havung said that The Laurel Inn is a wonderful hotel and I will continue to stay there. Nice hotel, east access to the freeway and shopping. This is a great motel. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I will stay here again. This was a nice hotel! Very clean and it was right off of the freeway! The only down side was that we needed to use the microwave after continental breakfast and we couldn’t! Even though we needed to use our room key to get into the breakfast room, it was locked once breakfast was over! Nice room and quiet. Nice selection for breakfast. One maintenance item was that the toilet wasn't properly bolted.to the floor and needed to be caulked. Heater was a bit quirky and per the sign. Would not begin beating for 5 minutes.. shower would not work, reported problem in am then went out for the day. when we got back nothing had been done. we got back after 10 pm. so no shower the next day. outlets in the sink area stopped working. they stated since we paid though expedia we would have to contact expedia fo adjustment. Consistent, clean, standard motel. Stay here when viisiting family. Usually just to shower and sleep. Basic hotel for a basic price. Room was clean although missing hair dryer- bracket but no actual dryer. Front desk did give me one to use. Breakfast was basic and breakfast area too small to accommodate all guests, but enough to get our morning started. You get what you pay for. The hotel and room was comfortable for the price. A little noisy next to the freeway. The motel staff were friendly. This place is only about 20 mins away from Monterey and it's also nearby Toro County park and Ford Order trails. Check-in went smoothly, room was on back side of the hotel and therefor quiet. Breakfast was ok. Orange juice was very watered down. Other then that it was great! Hotel is next to Black Bear diner! I love this hotel I’ve been working out of town in Salinas for some time I enjoy staying here close to job sites and very clean comfortable rooms,and they have a great breakfast too. Old hotel that could use some upgrades. Room was musty and had a weird odor. Smelled and felt like being in a sweaty, musty, smelly locker room. My asthma was acting up due to smell and skin was itchy due to something in the air or possible mold in the room. Basic motel, provides good value for money. Extra bed (rolled) for the 5th person  (kid) wad awful. Both the frame and the mattress didn't hold even a small child. You guys need to update your website to specify that this hotel does not accept any cash payments . it was very inconvenient and no one cares to do a thing about my situation. They only accept credit or debit cards. There is no privacy  you hear everything from the next room We stayed at this hotel about a year ago, and the room we had was great. Our last experience was disappointing. Our room was at the far end of the motel, closer to the freeway. I did not notice a noise increase, but did notice the wall paper was peeling off the walls in places, and the shower leaked a big puddle on the bathroom floor. As well, the parking lot was littered with cigarette butts --Yuck.. It is a comfortable and affordable hotel. We like the bed and the staff was very friendly. The hot breakfast was very nice. Room clean and comfortable. Staff friendly. Breakfast adequate and hot. For the low price we were amazed at how wonderful it was. The hotel was decent, it was a place to sleep after helping out at an Impact Wrestling taping. Where the issue lies is when we got there with our Hotels.com confirmation they asked for a Credit Card for a deposit so i used my Best Buy card. We stayed on Saturday March 24th and checked out on Sunday March 25th. Knowing that there would be no charges I didn't worry about having anything charged to that card since i paid for my room already. Got a notice today that there was a $127.99 charge from the Laurel Inn on my Best Buy card. I called the Laurel Inn an explained to them i booked the room on Hotels.com (they kept saying i booked it on expedia.com)  And i kept telling them i paid for the room and had the bank statement and hotels.com confirmation and i was placed on hold, and then hung up on. The hotel is fair for the price but i would be very wary of giving them a credit card you use frequently as you could miss double charges. Ok place, very thin wall. Pretty poor mattress, good shower No Hot Water.....Shower did not look clean. Noisy No Hot Water Great service staff members where so helpful Large rooms, comfortable beds. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. Rooms are musty but have been updated. Friendly staff. Our stay were good, free breakfast were ok food at Bear Diners were great and big portions. Room needs more trash can, it only have one small trash can, may be could use two more other than that Our stay were good. the Laurel Inn Hotel is very close to my parents home and it makes it much easier to stay there when all of my 5 other brothers and sisters are visiting too. It is clean, comfortable, and great service. Will stay again. Thanks so much The receptionist was extremely friendly and super welcoming. AND she remembered me from my previous stay.. I would not recommend this hotel at all. When I pulled back the bedspreads to get into bed, I discovered that the sheets were covered in what appeared to be back or chest hair. Covered. I called the front desk, but they seemed to doubt that I was even telling the truth. (I took video and pictures.) I was told that I could come down to the front desk to collect new sheets so that I could remake the bed myself, which is what we needed to do. The only other option was to change rooms, but all three kids were asleep at the time. The next morning at checkout I was told that the management was aware of the situation and would be contacting me later that day. It is two days later and I have not heard back from anyone. This is a follow-up to my post regarding the dirty sheets in our room. I had been told that the manager was aware of the situation and would contact me, but several days later, when I hadn't heard from him, I called back. The receptionist told me I was getting a 10% refund, and that the manager wouldn't talk to me because he had other things to deal with. I attempted to contact him on a few more occasions, but the manager would not take the time to talk with me. The location was convenient for us. The room aircon system is very noisy! We always bring our Roomba on road trips and it picked up a lot of dirt, dust, hair indicating the staff is not cleaning very well. Looks like it could use and overall upgrade. wasn,t expecting much for the price,but it was a verry pleasant stay After arriving from the East coast, I was told the computer systems were down and I could not be checked in, even though the front desk had my reservation. I should have cancelled then, but, against my better judgment I did not, and had a most unfortunate stay. Bathroom dirty, carpet dirty, coffee maker disgusting. Mechanical noises all night long, people appeared to have been living at the hotel, lots of what appeared to be transactions throughout the night. Area felt unsafe and layout was poor with not much lighting after dark. Canceling the remainder of my reservation was equally a hassle but fortunately Orbitz assisted to make it right. People like this place because it's cheap but you could not pay me to stay there again. Really admired how efficient and well-run this classic motel was. The women at reception were perfect. The place was packed, and the walls are thin, but I still slept like the dead here. As a basic motel the do everything really well, and the pool was a big plus. I thoroughly recommend. 50's style motel. Nothing fancy OK value............... The hotel was nice had a good feel needs tv upgrades the free breakfast is only cereal and breads but hey its free For a non-luxury hotel, this is as good as it gets. The structure is not new, but inside the rooms everything is there and spotless. It appears that this is one place where the hypothetical aspirations of hotel perfection, are mostly met by the hotel's staff and management. The free breakfast and food contributed to the positive experience. I'd stay here again, should the occasion present itself. Stayed during bike races at Laguna Seca 2 nights clean and quiet. Very friendly and accommodating staff. We arrived later than normal, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was a basic continental fare, consisting of breads and cereals. The AC was loud, which I loved! The bed was a little hard, but the pillows were soft. Very clean. Have stayed here multiple times - nice place, conveniently located, decent breakfast, decent restaurant on the premises, nice staff, cookies in the lobby, good value - but the beds are like sleeping on a rock! This last time I just couldn't get comfortable. If you're okay with a very firm mattress, you should be fine. it's what we expected it to be as per online description. keep up the good work. Nice surprise compared to some others we stayed within same price range. Quiet. Desk help was professional and helpful. A nice clean place to stay. Close to the freeway but far enough away to not hear traffic. Decent continental breakfast in a large clean eating area. It's ok for this money! The neighborhood does not look safe but it was quit. The room was ok for 1 night of staying! Room was very clean, it looked as though it had just been renovated The breakfast was good and the room was clean. I had to ask for a bag for the ice holder and the internet was spotty. But overall it was a good place to stay. There was lots of room for trailer parking, and it's right off Hwy 101. I really enjoyed my stay here. I liked the fact it was close to a really yummy restaurant. The only thing was the room layout was odd Our stay was great except for the slow WiFi. Hoping that the management will make it faster  the next time I'll stay. Taking a stop to break the drive from north to south California. Hotel is very clean, just off the highway but quiet. Check in is quick and staff is friendly. Room is clean, breakfast is average. Good value for our stay.
Central location with shopping and eating nearby. Great hotel for the money. Other than the hiccup with the check in everything was good. Make sure to check the checkin times on sundays
This hotel was relaxing from the moment you checked in until you departed, the staff are brilliant in the way they put the customer at the front of everything they do. At check-in to be greeted with a refreshing face cloth and glass of iced tea, made you feel the holiday had well and truly started. The room was well sized and the double bed was the largest I have ever slept in (including trips to USA). Breakfast offered a good mix of healthy and not so healthy alternatives with the added option of ordering freshly made pancakes or omelettes. The facilities (pool, spa, etc.) were maintained to a high standard and continued the relaxing experience that started at check in. This hotel and the team of staff are great ambassadors for the Vale Gale chain of hotels, I will be booking with them again. Also all images truly reflect this hotel and its facilities both in the room and communal areas. Free parking on the main road (although not controlled by the hotel) did not cause any issues. Impressed with early check in and friendly staff. You can request a late check out at an additional cost   I stayed at this lovely relaxing hotel in July it is Adults only and boy do you feel the difference when there are no kids about. It is so quiet and tranquil and if that is the type of holiday or break you are looking for then you will enjoy this hotel. If you are after a noisy busy vibrant place then this is not the hotel for you. Loved the hotel very quiet & relaxing. Very clean throughout could not fault anything. Will definitely be returning for another holiday. Good Hotel, small bathrooms, poor lighting in hallways, breakfast very repetitive (never changes), parking an issue if you rent a car since no reserved parking for hotel guests you will fight with thousands of beach goers daily especially in peak months. Clean rooms, hard beds, but good quality and great hotel staff that are extremely helpful If you want a holiday where you can chill, then here is perfect,  Very good pool area, beach 3 minute walk away with a couple of beach bars. Hotel has lovely new pizzeria, food in the hotel is good, if staff at breakfast mentioned eggs can be ordered fresh, it took us a day or so to see. Staff are a credit to the hotel. There is nowhere to go and nothing to do or see in the evening and there was no entertainment on at the hotel, no music no singers nothing. We taxied into Albufeira one evening it cost 21 euro. It was very busy and not our cup of tea at all we ate a meal and went back to our hotel again. Loved the peace and quiet, however not all the time, for us anyway. Beautiful hotel and cleanliness second to none. Lovely pool are and excellent spa facilities. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would definitely return. Lovely hotel, however, a little remote and no activities at the hotel. Food was excellent but very limited range (6 choices of risotto) no specific vegetarian options. Hotel staff very helpful apart from Jose who was very rude and unhelpful. Clean beautiful hotel, close to the beach!! All staff are really nice, breakfast was lovely! Sandra D was especially very welcoming and so helpful!! ! very relaxing, close to nice restaurants on the beach. Hotel clean, staff accommodating and friendly. Room comfortable and spacious. Staying at the Vila Galè Praia is wonderful. The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The food is excellent, and the service great. The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing, with enough sun loungers for everyone, and plenty of space around them. The beach is a very short stroll away, and is lovely, with a couple of excellent beach bars. A great place to stay... what more can I say! Overall an excellent hotel, the only small gripe was the service & I think this is down to the small number of staff. One morning I had finished my breakfast before I got a cup of tea after asking 3 times! Have stayed here several times. Staff and facilities are excellent. We enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and the excellent facilities. Restaurant has excellent menu- a very enjoyable three night trip. Wonderful stay at this well run hotel. Staff very friendly and hotel itself excellent. Close to the beach with a lovely pool perfect for relaxing! It was relaxing and comfortable Lovely hotel with great service from all the staff but the beds were a bit hard Nice place would return. Beds a little too hard for me while breakfast is just adequate - hot food not really hot! Facilities great as is the service We had an excellent short break. There is not one negative comment I could make. The hotel was peaceful, all the staff could not do enough for you. The pool was really lovely  There were several beach restaurants within walking distance all the of them were excellent. I stayed here for a week at the beginning of September. The hotel is excellent with helpful and friendly staff. The fact that it is an adult only hotel makes a notable difference, especially around the pool area where you can lie back and relax on the peaceful atmosphere. A short stroke from the beach makes this an ideal location. I would highly recommend this hotel and will happily return in the future.
Excellent , friendly staff . I've was able to change my room without additional cost . Good selection of food in restaurant . Private beach short walk away . Need to improve the accessories . Need to renew all TV in the rooms And increase the speed of Internet Low season , Hotel empty, very little selection on the buffet you have to pay for your own water with breakfast!!! !thats crazy..never had this experience before
Lovely week long trip. Hotel is a bit shabby at the edges. Staff are what makes this place. They cannot do enough for you. Food is very repetitive if you eat in the buffet. Restaurant food is amazing. I went for the diving. I can't emphasise enough how good the guys at Chloes diving look after you. There are some issues with translation sometimes but the set up is so convenient. At the hotel. 100 m from the jetty with a great boat and crew. I would definitely recommend. Excellent holiday hotel. The staff were excellent especially Ali Buffon in the shisha bar, he was extremely professional, friendly and polite. Hotel has many facilities to use for free. I would say that the massage prices are very high and we negotiated it down to £40 pounds for 50 minutes which is the same price here in the UK, and having experienced both massages UK massage is better considering they are the same price! I have been Egypt few times before and paid £20 for one hour massages which were better. Apart from this everything else is good. We were expecting a four star hotel based on the Expedia booking rating and price for this property. At check in we started to get concerned when we had to wear braclet tags to show we were guests for food etc. Once we entered the bedroom we decided to check out again. No mini bar no room service and a really basic garish coloured room. This is more of a motel than hotel and aimed at family market wouldn’t recommend for couples. For usd 7 more we checked into a 5 Star Sheraton and the difference was massive. A disappointing experience. 4 day stay. Resort was lovely. Kids Club was disappointing (not promoted so my daughter was the only one there). Staff were helpful and pleasant to deal with. Food was better than average. Exceeded expectations , Harry Nass centre excellent , Facilities were great , Food varied and Plentifull. Would and will go again Friendly staff,many activities, good food, close to the beach, close to the airport. Room was very clean and spacious and well furnished, food was good but can have some more variety added, the hotel has many many activities to offer as diving, kite surfing, water sports, etc. It was an amazing stay there. Good hotel. Very clean all around. Excellent and helpful staff. Meals were a bit crazy because it was an open buffet and there were a huge amount of unattended children. Wifi was only in reception and very poor quality. Otherwise solid all around choice.
Had a great holiday in this traditionally Spanish hotel. Both hotel and resort is refreshingly different. Don't expect fish and chips or a full English breakfasts but rather delicious local foods. First time in Benicassim. Nice place. Nice room in a great location next to beach...
The bed was not to my liking but that can be a personal thing, just feel for the price quality could have been better. Cooked eggs for breakfast maybe. Good roof terrace with great view of the Rio plata. Charming posada with great breakfast, beautiful views of Rio de la Plata from rooftop terrace. Very close to UNESCO world heritage site of Colonia del Sacramento.
Very good hotel, with excellent facilities it shares with the Royal Tulip. Rooms with separate sitting/working area, very large. Excellent for business or leisure trips. Arrived early, had to pay for a day room. Given wrong door key, then given a dirty room, third time had the right key and room. Helpful staff. There is only one restaurant nearby, about a mile and an easy walk. For everything else you need a taxi, and they are not cheap. the hotel is perfect, great and large rooms, loved the hotel across Royal Tulip, you can go to their restaurants that are better, and pool. the cafeteria in golden tulip food is not that great is cafeteria food, needs improvement, and the breakfast is very good
The location is excellent, nice breakfast, room facilities is good, except the lift sometimes not working very well. Generally is very good with reasonable price! Nice hotel, close to Opera. Very well located, close to many restaurants, shopping and cafes. It is a small hotel, but does its job, for the price, very good option. Safe & calm neighborhood with great hospitality felt at home in the middle of paris The hotel location was awesome, close to Opéra. Room was just right size for 2, not too small nor big. It was clean and staff was nice. But upon check-out, they over charged us for items in the fridge. We took 2 water bottles from the fridge, which is €3 each, they charged me €9 total, instead of €6. The bed was comfortable. The room was small and cramped. There was no safety rubber mat for the bathtub shower. Also no face cloths available. 1 Staff were very helpful with lots of information to help us with our stay in a city we did not know. They were also able to assist me with difficulties I was having with my mobile phone which enabled me to keep in touch with people through your free wifi. The hotel is in a great location and has good facilities. We stayed in the bigger room.staff were fantastic and helped with two personal problems. very central for h.o.h.o.bus depot.Only critism I have is shower in bath was akward for older person as no grab rail. Staff spoke English as we did not speak french. The rooms were small, which is certainly typical for hotels in the 2nd arr. Several of the staff were very helpful, but a couple were disinterested in doing anything beyond talking about a problem. There were no accessible outlets to charge phones or to use a medical machine required for sleeping. I got one person to agree to find an extension cord, but didn't follow through. I also asked about changing rooms to one that had an outlet near the bed. I was told that there were no vacancies. I spoke to a second who just shrugged, saying he did not know anything about it. My French is pretty proficient, so it was not a language issue. When I wrote to Orbitz, the company intervened for me. However, the hotel responded to Orbitz explaining that I needed an adaptor to use French outlets. Really? Thanks, hotel. I hadn't figured that out in my dozen or so trips to Europe. It wasn't horrific, but was unpleasant. Then the hotel offered to move me to another room. Magically, there were now vacancies, now that my comments were public. There are LOTS of other hotels in Paris...
